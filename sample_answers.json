            "passage": "Nat King Cole is one of the world’s greatest jazz legends. The records he made in the 1940s have been of major influence on jazz\nmusic. His impact on generations of pianists\nwas not just far-reaching: it was fundamental. Nat is often regarded as the man who made it possible for black musicians to break through in the U.S. music scene. He did not refuse to perform before segregated audiences, for he believed that goodwill and exhibition of his talent were more effective than formal protests in fighting racism. His approach was not always a success: he was a victim of several racial incidents throughout his life. 1919 – 1936\nNathaniel Adams Coles was born on March 17 1919* in Montgomery, Alabama. He was born in a poor family: his father, Edward James Coles sr., was a reverend, his mother Perlina Adams Coles was the choir director of her husband’s church. Even though Nat’s parents had thirteen children, only five of them made it to adulthood. Nat grew up with his brother Edward jr. and his two sisters, Eddie Mae and Evelyn. When Nat was four years old his family moved to Chicago where his father had been offered pastorship of the True Light Baptist Church. In Chicago his parents got two more boys, Issac and Lionel (better known as “Freddie”.) Nat was taught to play the piano at an early age by his mother. Perlina, determined to give her children a musical education, succeeded. Her four sons all became professional musicians. When Nat was 12 years old he regularly sung and played the organ in church. After he joined Wendell Phillips High School he was introduced to jazz music and was greatly enthusiastic about this new type of music: together with his brother Eddie he would explore the Chicago jazz scene whenever he could. In 1934 Nat organized a jazz quintet called “Nat Coles and his Royal Dukes”, as well as a 14-piece orchestra called “Rogues of Rhythm”. When Nat heard Earl Hines play one night, he was heavily impressed and driven to give his quintet a new, more rhythmic sound, much like Hines’. Later he’d say about Hines: \"It was his driving force that appealed to me ... I was just a kid and coming up, but I latched onto that new Hines style. Guess I still show the influence today.\" (-Down Beat, 1957). When Nat was 16 he joined Eddie’s band “Solid Swingers” and started performing at jazz joints throughout Chicago. It was in these joints that Nat gained his first bit of success. The (mere) success didn’t do much good to Nat’s educational career: he dropped out of High School in 1936. 1936 - 1940\nNot long after he turned 18, Nat married Nadine Robinson. They had met each other on the vaudeville “Shuffle Along”. Nadine was one of the show’s dancers, while Nat was a pianist in the vaudeville-orchestra. When the show ended the couple settled in Los Angeles. They didn’t have much money and in order to pay the rent Nat had to play the piano in local beer joints for little pay. After a year of hard work Cole’s talent was discovered by the owner of the famous Century Club, at that time the most popular hangout in L.A. for jazz musicians – Nat became a regular performer at this club. Around 1938 Nat was asked to form a quintet (that eventually became a trio as drummer Lee Young didn’t show up on the opening night.) After bassist Wesley Prince and guitarist Oscar Moore joined, the group performed at the Sewanee Inn, an L.A. nightclub. Owner of the nightclub, Bob Lewis, asked from Nat that he would carry a golden crown made of paper - this is how Nat got his nickname “King”. Nat soon got rid of the crown, but the band kept its name: the “King Cole Trio”. 1940 - 1950\nIn their early days, the King Cole Trio played instrumental jazz. After 1940 they gradually introduced vocals to their music**. December 1940 they had the opportunity to record for the Decca record company. They recorded the hit song “Sweet Lorraine” and the groups’ popularity increased dramatically. The King Cole Trio was a bit of an oddity in their days. The music scene was dominated by Big Bands and black musicians were rejected from popular clubs, racism still being very common in the early 1940s.",

            "passage": "Nat King Cole Biography, Life, Interesting Facts\nDied On :\nAlso Known For :\nBirth Place :\nChildhood And Early Life\nNat King Cole was born on March 17, 1917, in Montgomery, Alabama. He was the youngest son of Reverend Edwards Coles and Perlina Coles. At the age of four, Cole's family shifted base to North Chicago, Illinois where his father became the pastor of the church. Nat King Cole's first lessons in music were imparted by his mother, a church organist. She taught her son the art of playing the piano. Soon after, Cole started playing the organ and singing in the choir of his father's church. During his teenage years, Nat King Cole began taking formal lessons in music. He polished his music sense by learning different genres of music like jazz, gospel music, and Western Classical music. At the age of 15, Cole dropped out of school to pursue a full-time career in music. He started out as a jazz pianist. In the year, 1936, he took the byname Nat Cole and left Chicago to form his own jazz band 'Rogues of Rhythm.' His elder brother, Eddie, a bassist, joined forces with Cole's group and made their first professional recording. Nat King Cole and his brother were signed up to perform with the all-black Broadway musical revue 'Shuffle Along'. Though Eddie stayed back, Cole joined the troupe as a pianist on their national tour. After completing the tour, Cole started working on his music and subsequently, in 1937, he collaborated with guitarist Oscar Moore and bassist Wesley Prince to form the legendary music group 'The King Cole Trio.' The group members were masters in swing music and hence were also known as 'King Cole and His Swingsters.' The music group performed in local bars and toured extensively. In the late 1940's, the King Cole Trio signed a contract with Decca. Their very first achievement came in the year 1943 with the release of Cole's composition 'That ain't Right.' The song penned by Cole instantly struck the chord and became a chartbuster. In the same year, their contract with Decca came to an end. The trio reached the pinnacle of success when Nat King Cole started doubling as pianist and singer. The trio was soon signed up by Capitol Records. In the latter half of 1943, Nat King Cole and his Swingsters achieved commercial success with Cole's first vocal hit 'Straighten Up and Fly Right.' The song penned by Cole was inspired by the theme of his father's sermons. In the following years, the King Cole Trio reached the peaks of their career as they consecutively belted out chart hits like 'The Christmas Song,' 'For Sentimental Reasons,' 'Nature Boy' and many more. Though Nat King Cole had gained prominence as a jazz pianist, his soft baritone voice and sophisticated style of singing mesmerized his audiences prompting him to pursue a career as a solo artist. Cole emerged as the singing sensation of his time releasing track hits one after the other. Some of his best-known works are his signature song 'Unforgettable' (1951), the holiday hit 'The Christmas Song' (1946), 'Monalisa' (1950) and the number 1 song of 1951 'Too Young.' Throughout the 1950's, Cole continued to enjoy stardom and released several tracks that became chartbusters. \"Smile,\" \"Pretend,\" \"A Blossom Fell,\" and \"If I May\" are some of the well-known songs of that time. Nat King Cole was not just limited to music. He made several television appearances and had acted in short films and sitcoms. King Cole is the first African-American to host a national television variety show, 'The Nat King Cole Show.' Premiered on November 5, 1956, on NBC, the show began as a 15-minute pops show. But seeing the show's massive popularity, it was later expanded to cover a half an hour slot. Awards And Achievements\n- In 1963, Nat King Cole was awarded the prestigious Golden Globe Special Award. - In 1990, Cole was posthumously conferred with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. - He was inducted into Alabama Music Hall of Fame, Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame, Jazz Hall of Fame and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame. - His legacy stays on as a US postage stamp that was issued in 1994.",

            "passage": "Wednesday, February 10, 2016\nNat King Cole (1919-1965) - Fly Right\nNat King Cole (1919-1965)\nStraighten Up and Fly Right (1943)\nNathaniel Adams Coles (March 17, 1919 - February 15, 1965), known professionally as Nat King Cole, was born in Montgomery, Alabama. His birth date, according to the World Almanac, was on Saint Patrick's Day in 1919; other sources have erroneously listed his birthdate as 1917. His father was a preacher in the Baptist church. His family moved to Chicago, Illinois, while he was still a child. There, his father became a minister; Nat's mother, Perlina, was the church organist. Nat learned to play the organ from his mother until the age of 12, when he began formal lessons. His first performance, at age four, was of Yes, We Have No Bananas. He learned not only jazz and gospel music, but European classical music as well, performing, as he said, \"from Johann Sebastian Bach to Sergei Rachmaninoff.\" So much for 20th-century music... The family lived in the Bronzeville neighborhood of Chicago. Nat would sneak out of the house and hang outside the clubs, listening to artists such as Louis Armstrong, Earl \"Fatha\" Hines, and Jimmie Noone. He participated in Walter Dyett's renowned music program at DuSable High School. Inspired by the playing of Earl Hines, Cole began his performing career in the mid 1930's while he was still a teenager, and adopted the name \"Nat Cole.\" His older brother, Eddie Coles, a bassist, soon joined Nat's band and they first recorded in 1936 under Eddie's name. They were also regular performers at clubs. In fact, Nat got his nickname \"King\" performing at one jazz club, a nickname presumably reinforced by the otherwise-unrelated nursery rhyme about Old King Cole. He was also a pianist in a national touring revival of ragtime and Broadway theatre legend, Eubie Blake's revue, \"Shuffle Along.\" When it suddenly failed in Long Beach, California, Cole decided to remain there. Nat Cole and three other musicians formed the \"King Cole Swingers\" in Long Beach and played in a number of local bars before getting a gig on the Long Beach Pike for US$90 per week. Nat married a dancer Megan Robinson, who was also with Shuffle Along, and moved to Los Angeles where he formed the Nat King Cole Trio. The trio consisted of Nat on piano, Oscar Moore on guitar, and Wesley Prince on double bass. The trio played in Los Angeles throughout the late 1930s and recorded many radio transcriptions. Nat's role was that of piano player and leader of the combo. It is a common misconception that Nat Cole's singing career did not start until a drunken barroom patron demanded that he sing \"Sweet Lorraine.\" In fact, Nat Cole has gone on record as saying that the fabricated story \"sounded good, so I just let it ride.\" In fact Nat Cole frequently sang in between instrumental numbers. Noticing that people started to request more vocal numbers, he obliged. Yet, the story of the insistent customer is not without merit. There was such a customer who did request a certain song one night, but a song that Nat did not know. Instead he sang \"Sweet Lorraine.\" The trio was tipped 15 cents for the performance, a nickel apiece (Nat King Cole: An Intimate Biography, Maria Cole with Louie Robinson, 1971). During World War II, Wesley Prince left the group and Cole replaced him with Johnny Miller. Miller would later be replaced by Charlie Harris in the 1950's. The King Cole Trio signed with the fledgling Capitol Records in 1943 and Cole stayed with the recording company for the rest of his career. Revenues from Cole's record sales fueled much of Capitol Records' success during this period, and are believed to have played a significant role in financing the distinctive Capitol Records building on Hollywood and Vine, in Los Angeles. Completed in 1956, it was the world's first circular office building and became known as \"the house that Nat built.\" Cole was considered a leading jazz pianist, appearing, for example, in the first Jazz at the Philharmonic concerts (credited on the Mercury Record labels as \"Shorty Nadine,\" apparently derived from the name of his wife at the time).",

            "passage": "His revolutionary lineup of piano, guitar and bass in the time of the big bands became a popular set up for a jazz trio. It was emulated by many musicians, among them Art Tatum, Erroll Garner, Oscar Peterson, Ahmad Jamal, Tommy Flanagan and blues pianists Charles Brown and Ray Charles. He also performed as a pianist on sessions with Lester Young, Red Callender, and Lionel Hampton. The Page Cavanaugh Trio with the same set up as Cole came out of the chute about the same time, at the end of the war. Cole's first mainstream vocal hit was his 1943 recording of one of his compositions, \"Straighten Up and Fly Right,\" based on a black folk tale that his father had used as a theme for a sermon. Johnny Mercer invited him to record it for the fledgling Capitol Records label. It sold over 500,000 copies, and proved that folk-based material could appeal to a wide audience. Although Nat would never be considered a rocker, the song can be seen as anticipating the first rock and roll records. Indeed, Bo Diddley, who performed similar transformations of folk material, counted Cole as an influence. Beginning in the late 1940's, Cole began recording and performing more pop-oriented material for mainstream audiences, often accompanied by a string orchestra. His stature as a popular icon was cemented during this period by hits such as \"The Christmas Song\" (Cole recorded the tune four times: June 14, 1946 as a pure Trio recording; August 19, 1946 with an added string section; August 24, 1953; and again in 1961 for the double album, The Nat King Cole Story. This final version, recorded in stereo, is the one most often heard today. ), \"Nature Boy\" (1948), \"Mona Lisa\" (1950), \"Too Young\" (the #1 song in 1951), and his signature tune \"Unforgettable\" (1951). While this shift to pop music led some jazz critics and fans to accuse Cole of selling out, he never totally abandoned his jazz roots; as late as 1956, for instance, he recorded an all-jazz album, After Midnight. [Harold Arlen - It's Only a Paper Moon]\nThe change in musical tastes during the late 1950s meant that Cole's ballad singing did not sell well with younger listeners, despite a successful stab at rock n' roll with \"Send For Me\" (peaked at #6 pop). Along with his contemporaries Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett, Cole found that the pop singles chart had been almost entirely taken over by youth-oriented acts. In 1960, Nat's long-time collaborator Nelson Riddle left Capitol Records for Frank Sinatra's newly formed Reprise Records label. Riddle and Cole recorded one final hit album Wild Is Love, based on lyrics by Ray Rasch and Dotty Wayne. Cole later retooled the concept album into an off-Broadway show, I'm With You. Cole, a heavy smoker who would smoke as much as three packets of cigarettes a day, died of lung cancer on February 15, 1965, while still at the height of his singing career. The day before he died, he did a radio interview, stating: \"I am feeling better than ever. I think I've finally got this cancer licked.\" [8919 Courage \/ 8919 Nat King Cole \/ 8918 Bernstein]",

            "passage": "The trio, however, was one of the first bands to be accepted to these “white” clubs. In 1941 the band went on a national tour. After touring for a few months they settled in New York where they performed at top jazz clubs. In 1942 Wesley Prince was drafted, he was replaced by Johnny Miller. With Miller the group moved back to Los Angeles where they did a series of performances at club “331”. One year later the trio was signed to Capitol Records. They recorded “Straighten Up and Fly Right”, which became a hit in 1944***. More hits the group made with Capitol in this period were “Get Your Kicks on Route 66\" and \"For Sentimental Reasons,\" amongst others. The late 1940s were a busy time for the trio. From 1946 till 1950 they filled the weekly radio program “Kraft Music Hall.” Together with pianist Eddy Duchin they gave young skillful artists the chance to reach a large audience. \"You have no idea how much satisfaction I got from the acceptance of the trio, because we opened the way for countless other small groups, units that before were strictly for cocktail lounges,\" Cole told Down Beat in 1957. In the same period the trio also played in a few movies, including “Breakfast in Hollywood”, “See my lawyer” and “The Stork Club.”\nIn 1946 Nat met the singer Maria Ellington (not related to The Duke, although she sang in his band for a short time) and fell in love with her. After divorcing Nadine he married Maria on March 28, 1948. Influenced by Maria, Nat radically moved away from jazz with the major hit “The Christmas Song” (December 1946.) “The Christmas Song” was the first song in which Nat sung rather than played the piano, with string section accompaniment. In 1947 Oscar Moore decided to leave the trio, Irving Ashby took his place. Nat more and more desired to become a mainstream artist rather than a jazz pianist. This was made clear in another major hit song: “Nature Boy” (1948.) 1950 - 1960\nNat’s first daughter, Natalie (nicknamed “Sweetie”) was born on February 6, 1950. A few months later Nat released the ballad “Mona Lisa” (that stayed on the charts for a record amount of weeks.) “Mona Lisa” permanently changed Nat’s career. The other members of the Cole King Trio had become Nat’s background music, this caused irritations and in 1955 the trio split up. Nat now gained great fame as a solo singer, many of his new fans didn’t even know he used to be a jazz pianist. During the 50’s he made success with \"Unforgettable,\" \"Too Young,\" \"Answer Me, My Love,\" and \"Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup.\" In 1956 Nat was asked to start an own TV show for NBC. This was quite an event: never before a major TV company had asked a Negro to host a show. The show was popular and got good ratings, but Nat never knew to find a sponsor. Businesses were afraid that white southern audiences would associate their products with a Negro. This caused the show to be cancelled after only one year of airtime. Nat did appear on the big screen another few times: in the movie “St. Louis Blues”(1958) for example, and in “The Nat King Cole Story”(1955), an autobiographic film. For a complete list of movies Nat appeared in, see the filmography below. Mid-fifties Nat and Maria adopted Maria’s sister’s daughter Carol, after both of Carol’s parents had died. In 1959 they adopted a boy whom they called Nat Kelly. Plagued by the popularity of Rock and Roll and upcoming artists like Johnny Mathis and Harry Belafonte, Nat’s career went a bit downhill in the late fifties. To prevent this he organized a touring concert show called “Sights and Sounds.” The show presented a group of young dancers and singers who called themselves the “Merry Young Souls.”\n1960 - 1965\nEven though Nat and Maria never thought they would get any more children of their own, in 1961 Maria got pregnant and gave birth to twins: Casey (named after baseball legend Casey Stengel) and Timolin. Nat’s career knew a revival in the early 1960s after he recorded the pop songs \"Ramblin' Rose\" and \"Those Lazy, Hazy, Crazy Days of Summer\" that both came on #1 in the American charts. Late 1964 Nat was diagnosed with lung cancer.",

He was a Black musician and singer. Nathaniel Adams Cole was born in Montgomery, Alabama, but grew up in Chicago. In 1937, after touring with a Black musical revue, he began playing in jazz clubs in Los Angeles. There he formed the King Cole Trio, with guitarist Oscar Moore and bassist Wesley Prince, in 1939. With his compact, syncopated backup chords and clean, spare, melodic phrases, Cole emphasized the piano as a solo, rather than a rhythm, instrument in his jazz arrangements. Commercial success came with his singing. After Straighten Up and Fly Right (1943), Cole gradually abandoned jazz piano for popular vocals. Among his other hits were Nature Boy, Mona Lisa, Too Young, and Unforgettable. After his marriage to Maria Hawkins Ellington, his daughter Natalie Maria Cole was born in Los Angeles, CA. Cole toured internationally and appeared in motion pictures. He first came to prominence as a jazz pianist but reached enormous popularity with his warm, relaxed, somewhat breathy-voiced ballad singing. He died February 15, 1965 in Santa Monica, California.

Often cited as the single finest interpreter of American standards, he influenced generations of vocalists such as Nat King Cole and Carmen McRae by focusing on phrasing and matching narrative nuance and emotional naturalism with amazing breathing control. In the 1930s, Sinatra starting bringing back \"old\" songs by such masters as Cole Porter while he was still a Big Band singer. He became a national institution in the '40s, and even though Ray Charles has praised the flawless technique of this Columbia period, Sinatra kept evolving. Starting in the '50s he concentrated on groundbreaking concept albums and a fresh Big Band sound with master arranger Nelson Riddle. Sinatra explored every nuance of emotion on these Capitol and Reprise albums and influenced the work of Ella Fitzgerald and Peggy Lee. Beginning in the '70s, when rock ruled, his voice and output became erratic but some brilliant work remains. Though Sinatra always viewed himself as a popular singer, jazz musicians hold his work in the highest esteem. Miles Davis and Lester Young often interpreted standards through his versions and avant-gardist John Zorn has said that in his own way, Frank Sinatra was as much a jazz improviser as Charlie Parker.",

In large part, the song and singer became famous because of each other, and so these versions became famous--not just the song, and not just the singer. I want you to think about what makes a song and singer go beyond being famous to the point it becomes part of the larger culture. If you are uncomfortable with this assignment, please let me know and I will give you an alternative assignment to complete. I have posted these songs on a private page on my personal website because I can embed them directly. On CompassNet I can only make them so you can download them and I think this will be easier for you. 1. Choose FIVE songs from the list below. Don’t just choose the first five. Look around a little and find some that look fun or at least interesting. Listen to the songs. 2. After you decide which song you like best, answer the two questions I asked (there are two questions below each song). You only need to answer the questions for the song you liked most. You will need to Google and think a little to answer these questions, but the answers are available. 3. Pick the song you personally liked least. I want you to explain why it might have become popular. Why might other people have liked it? 4. Once you have done the required five songs, you may do more for extra credit. There are two options for extra credit. One: you can answer the two questions for more of the songs you listened to. OR, there is an extra credit section below. Follow the directions. I will give you two points of extra credit for every additional two questions you answer, or each of the compare\/contrast options you complete. The maximum you may earn in extra credit is ten points. This assignment is due by January 6, 2016. Five songs should not be hard if you start right away and do a little each day. If you wait until the end, it will be hard. So please don't procrastinate. I estimate each song will take you about 10 minutes to listen and then answer the questions. Have fun! I can think of far worse homework assignments. \"Believe\" Josh Groban\nThis song is not yet a classic. It came from a movie that didn't do all that well. But, every year I feel like I hear it more and more. I think it might be becoming a classic. Listen to the music and think of the way it makes you feel. Question 1: What sort of emotions and images does it call up in your mind? Question 2: Do you think this song will ever become a classic, like \"Frosty\" or \"Rudolph\"? Why or why not? (Be specific. \"Blue Christmas\" Elvis Presley\nElvis Presley was an enormously influential performer. Most young people in his era loved him. Many other people thought he was inspired by the devil. Today, some people still love him, others think he is incredibly tacky. Listen to this song and tell me what you think. Question 1: Do you like his voice? Why or why not? Question 2: What was the nickname people gave Elvis Presley? The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire) Nat King Cole\nNat King Cole is said to have had one of the smoothest voices ever. He has a famous daughter who you might have heard sing on the radio. Question 1: What presidents consulted with Nat King Cole? Question 2: What caused Cole's death? \"Frosty the Snowman\" Jimmy Durante\nIf you've seen the cartoon version of Frosty the Snowman, you've heard Jimmy Durante sing this song. Durante was another popular performer in his day. He started out performing in vaudeville singing, dancing, and doing comedy. If you listen, though, you can tell he doesn't have the nicest, smoothest voice. Question 1: Who was the original artist to record this song? Question 2: What was Jimmy Durante's nickname and to what did it refer? \"The Most Wonderful Time of the Year\" Andy Williams\nAt one time, Andy Williams received the largest contract a recording artist had ever earned before. He performed a song for a movie that became famous and became his theme song. Question 1: What was that song? Question 2: At which famous politician's funeral did Williams sing? \"Happy Xmas (War is Over)\" John Lennon\nQuestion 1: Explain what historical even this song is connected to?

            "passage": "A lot of people think that Earl Hines might be the forerunner of Bop, because he played a lot of single-finger lines. That was his style. And as you say, Nat Cole must have heard him and must have been influenced by him. He recollected hanging out in the alley behind the Grand Terrace in Chicago in the 1930’s, and checking him out. But this brings me to a question, which is the formation of your aesthetic, the pianists you heard, how you began to assimilate styles. The biographies say that you were mightily impressed by Art Tatum, Teddy Wilson and Fats Waller, the main subject of your recent recording, Handful Of Keys. A few words about Fats Waller. HJ: Well, I remember very clearly hearing Fats Waller on the radio every morning when I was going to junior high school. There were two radio stations, CKLW and KCLK; one of them was in Canada, in Windsor, and the other one was in Detroit. They used to play many records of Fats Waller. He always impressed me as a very rhythmic pianist, and he had a happy sound. Another pianist who had that same kind of sound, but a different sound, was Erroll Garner. Erroll Garner had that happy feeling. When you listened to his music, you felt uplifted, generally. It put you on a higher level of enjoyment. Fats Waller had that. And what a great way to start off the day! Because before we left the house to go to school, we were listening to Fats Waller. Duke Ellington gave me a different kind of feeling. Of course, it was all big band. But Duke, in spite of what some people might think, was an excellent pianist. I guess when the band was playing, of course, he preferred to let the musicians in the band take the spotlight as far as solo playing was concerned…\nThey were extensions of him anyway. HJ: Exactly. I always liked Duke’s piano-playing style. And his ideas, of course, were very innovative. Although Duke, if he were here today, would tell you that Willie The Lion Smith influenced him quite a bit. And when you listen to some of the Willie The Lion Smith piano solos (and I have some of them, by the way), you can hear the later Duke Ellington. So Duke was greatly influenced in that respect. I mean, everybody is. That’s not unusual. You have to have a role model. And I’m sure that Willie was one of Duke’s role models. The others were probably some other pianists that we don’t even know about…\nWell, it’s very interesting how styles were disseminated even at a time when there was much less universal media from one part of the country to another, just because of the traveling life of musicians — and of course, from records. HJ: Yes, records. There weren’t as many, but… Or just traveling musicians who would go from place to place. Some people like to describe them as itinerant. I don’t. [LAUGHS] Maybe they had to move from place to place because there was no work where they were, and so they were trying to find work. I’m sure the basic reason for their travel was not that they loved it; it’s just they had to do it in order to survive. But you mentioned Earl Hines. Well, of course, Earl Hines was a single-line pianist. That’s the best way to describe his playing. He had a very good band in the 1930’s and early ’40s. As a matter of fact, Sarah Vaughan used to sing in his band at one time. She got her start in that band. HJ: That’s right. And he had violins at one time, by the way. Well, he had to take care of a whole show at the Grand Terrace in Chicago, so a lot of his repertoire had to be geared toward the dancers and the comedians, and deal with the whole range of entertainment. HJ: That’s right. Art Tatum was in the Midwest quite a bit in the 1930’s. He was from Toledo, Ohio. HJ: Yes, he was. There was another pianist, Lannie Scott, who you may not have heard of (or maybe you have). Lannie and Art used to work opposite each other in the same club, Val’s in the Alley in Toledo. Then later on I met Lannie in Detroit. As a matter of fact, I worked opposite Lannie Scott. But they had similar styles.",

The records he made in the 1940s have been of major influence on jazz\nmusic. His impact on generations of pianists\nwas not just far-reaching: it was fundamental. Nat is often regarded as the man who made it possible for black musicians to break through in the U.S. music scene. He did not refuse to perform before segregated audiences, for he believed that goodwill and exhibition of his talent were more effective than formal protests in fighting racism. His approach was not always a success: he was a victim of several racial incidents throughout his life. 1919 – 1936\nNathaniel Adams Coles was born on March 17 1919* in Montgomery, Alabama. He was born in a poor family: his father, Edward James Coles sr., was a reverend, his mother Perlina Adams Coles was the choir director of her husband’s church. Even though Nat’s parents had thirteen children, only five of them made it to adulthood. Nat grew up with his brother Edward jr. and his two sisters, Eddie Mae and Evelyn. When Nat was four years old his family moved to Chicago where his father had been offered pastorship of the True Light Baptist Church. In Chicago his parents got two more boys, Issac and Lionel (better known as “Freddie”.) Nat was taught to play the piano at an early age by his mother. Perlina, determined to give her children a musical education, succeeded. Her four sons all became professional musicians. When Nat was 12 years old he regularly sung and played the organ in church. After he joined Wendell Phillips High School he was introduced to jazz music and was greatly enthusiastic about this new type of music: together with his brother Eddie he would explore the Chicago jazz scene whenever he could. In 1934 Nat organized a jazz quintet called “Nat Coles and his Royal Dukes”, as well as a 14-piece orchestra called “Rogues of Rhythm”. When Nat heard Earl Hines play one night, he was heavily impressed and driven to give his quintet a new, more rhythmic sound, much like Hines’. Later he’d say about Hines: \"It was his driving force that appealed to me ... I was just a kid and coming up, but I latched onto that new Hines style. Guess I still show the influence today.\" (-Down Beat, 1957). When Nat was 16 he joined Eddie’s band “Solid Swingers” and started performing at jazz joints throughout Chicago. It was in these joints that Nat gained his first bit of success. The (mere) success didn’t do much good to Nat’s educational career: he dropped out of High School in 1936. 1936 - 1940\nNot long after he turned 18, Nat married Nadine Robinson. They had met each other on the vaudeville “Shuffle Along”. Nadine was one of the show’s dancers, while Nat was a pianist in the vaudeville-orchestra. When the show ended the couple settled in Los Angeles. They didn’t have much money and in order to pay the rent Nat had to play the piano in local beer joints for little pay. After a year of hard work Cole’s talent was discovered by the owner of the famous Century Club, at that time the most popular hangout in L.A. for jazz musicians – Nat became a regular performer at this club. Around 1938 Nat was asked to form a quintet (that eventually became a trio as drummer Lee Young didn’t show up on the opening night.) After bassist Wesley Prince and guitarist Oscar Moore joined, the group performed at the Sewanee Inn, an L.A. nightclub. Owner of the nightclub, Bob Lewis, asked from Nat that he would carry a golden crown made of paper - this is how Nat got his nickname “King”. Nat soon got rid of the crown, but the band kept its name: the “King Cole Trio”. 1940 - 1950\nIn their early days, the King Cole Trio played instrumental jazz. After 1940 they gradually introduced vocals to their music**. December 1940 they had the opportunity to record for the Decca record company. They recorded the hit song “Sweet Lorraine” and the groups’ popularity increased dramatically. The King Cole Trio was a bit of an oddity in their days. The music scene was dominated by Big Bands and black musicians were rejected from popular clubs, racism still being very common in the early 1940s.\n\nNat King Cole Biography, Life, Interesting Facts\nDied On :\nAlso Known For :\nBirth Place :\nChildhood And Early Life\nNat King Cole was born on March 17, 1917, in Montgomery, Alabama. He was the youngest son of Reverend Edwards Coles and Perlina Coles. At the age of four, Cole's family shifted base to North Chicago, Illinois where his father became the pastor of the church. Nat King Cole's first lessons in music were imparted by his mother, a church organist. She taught her son the art of playing the piano. Soon after, Cole started playing the organ and singing in the choir of his father's church. During his teenage years, Nat King Cole began taking formal lessons in music. He polished his music sense by learning different genres of music like jazz, gospel music, and Western Classical music. At the age of 15, Cole dropped out of school to pursue a full-time career in music. He started out as a jazz pianist. In the year, 1936, he took the byname Nat Cole and left Chicago to form his own jazz band 'Rogues of Rhythm.' His elder brother, Eddie, a bassist, joined forces with Cole's group and made their first professional recording. Nat King Cole and his brother were signed up to perform with the all-black Broadway musical revue 'Shuffle Along'. Though Eddie stayed back, Cole joined the troupe as a pianist on their national tour. After completing the tour, Cole started working on his music and subsequently, in 1937, he collaborated with guitarist Oscar Moore and bassist Wesley Prince to form the legendary music group 'The King Cole Trio.' The group members were masters in swing music and hence were also known as 'King Cole and His Swingsters.' The music group performed in local bars and toured extensively. In the late 1940's, the King Cole Trio signed a contract with Decca. Their very first achievement came in the year 1943 with the release of Cole's composition 'That ain't Right.' The song penned by Cole instantly struck the chord and became a chartbuster. In the same year, their contract with Decca came to an end. The trio reached the pinnacle of success when Nat King Cole started doubling as pianist and singer. The trio was soon signed up by Capitol Records. In the latter half of 1943, Nat King Cole and his Swingsters achieved commercial success with Cole's first vocal hit 'Straighten Up and Fly Right.' The song penned by Cole was inspired by the theme of his father's sermons. In the following years, the King Cole Trio reached the peaks of their career as they consecutively belted out chart hits like 'The Christmas Song,' 'For Sentimental Reasons,' 'Nature Boy' and many more. Though Nat King Cole had gained prominence as a jazz pianist, his soft baritone voice and sophisticated style of singing mesmerized his audiences prompting him to pursue a career as a solo artist. Cole emerged as the singing sensation of his time releasing track hits one after the other. Some of his best-known works are his signature song 'Unforgettable' (1951), the holiday hit 'The Christmas Song' (1946), 'Monalisa' (1950) and the number 1 song of 1951 'Too Young.' Throughout the 1950's, Cole continued to enjoy stardom and released several tracks that became chartbusters. \"Smile,\" \"Pretend,\" \"A Blossom Fell,\" and \"If I May\" are some of the well-known songs of that time. Nat King Cole was not just limited to music. He made several television appearances and had acted in short films and sitcoms. King Cole is the first African-American to host a national television variety show, 'The Nat King Cole Show.' Premiered on November 5, 1956, on NBC, the show began as a 15-minute pops show. But seeing the show's massive popularity, it was later expanded to cover a half an hour slot. Awards And Achievements\n- In 1963, Nat King Cole was awarded the prestigious Golden Globe Special Award. - In 1990, Cole was posthumously conferred with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. - He was inducted into Alabama Music Hall of Fame, Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame, Jazz Hall of Fame and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame. - His legacy stays on as a US postage stamp that was issued in 1994.\n\nWednesday, February 10, 2016\nNat King Cole (1919-1965) - Fly Right\nNat King Cole (1919-1965)\nStraighten Up and Fly Right (1943)\nNathaniel Adams Coles (March 17, 1919 - February 15, 1965), known professionally as Nat King Cole, was born in Montgomery, Alabama. His birth date, according to the World Almanac, was on Saint Patrick's Day in 1919; other sources have erroneously listed his birthdate as 1917. His father was a preacher in the Baptist church. His family moved to Chicago, Illinois, while he was still a child. There, his father became a minister; Nat's mother, Perlina, was the church organist. Nat learned to play the organ from his mother until the age of 12, when he began formal lessons. His first performance, at age four, was of Yes, We Have No Bananas. He learned not only jazz and gospel music, but European classical music as well, performing, as he said, \"from Johann Sebastian Bach to Sergei Rachmaninoff.\" So much for 20th-century music... The family lived in the Bronzeville neighborhood of Chicago. Nat would sneak out of the house and hang outside the clubs, listening to artists such as Louis Armstrong, Earl \"Fatha\" Hines, and Jimmie Noone. He participated in Walter Dyett's renowned music program at DuSable High School. Inspired by the playing of Earl Hines, Cole began his performing career in the mid 1930's while he was still a teenager, and adopted the name \"Nat Cole.\" His older brother, Eddie Coles, a bassist, soon joined Nat's band and they first recorded in 1936 under Eddie's name. They were also regular performers at clubs. In fact, Nat got his nickname \"King\" performing at one jazz club, a nickname presumably reinforced by the otherwise-unrelated nursery rhyme about Old King Cole. He was also a pianist in a national touring revival of ragtime and Broadway theatre legend, Eubie Blake's revue, \"Shuffle Along.\" When it suddenly failed in Long Beach, California, Cole decided to remain there. Nat Cole and three other musicians formed the \"King Cole Swingers\" in Long Beach and played in a number of local bars before getting a gig on the Long Beach Pike for US$90 per week. Nat married a dancer Megan Robinson, who was also with Shuffle Along, and moved to Los Angeles where he formed the Nat King Cole Trio. The trio consisted of Nat on piano, Oscar Moore on guitar, and Wesley Prince on double bass. The trio played in Los Angeles throughout the late 1930s and recorded many radio transcriptions. Nat's role was that of piano player and leader of the combo. It is a common misconception that Nat Cole's singing career did not start until a drunken barroom patron demanded that he sing \"Sweet Lorraine.\" In fact, Nat Cole has gone on record as saying that the fabricated story \"sounded good, so I just let it ride.\" In fact Nat Cole frequently sang in between instrumental numbers. Noticing that people started to request more vocal numbers, he obliged. Yet, the story of the insistent customer is not without merit. There was such a customer who did request a certain song one night, but a song that Nat did not know. Instead he sang \"Sweet Lorraine.\" The trio was tipped 15 cents for the performance, a nickel apiece (Nat King Cole: An Intimate Biography, Maria Cole with Louie Robinson, 1971). During World War II, Wesley Prince left the group and Cole replaced him with Johnny Miller. Miller would later be replaced by Charlie Harris in the 1950's. The King Cole Trio signed with the fledgling Capitol Records in 1943 and Cole stayed with the recording company for the rest of his career. Revenues from Cole's record sales fueled much of Capitol Records' success during this period, and are believed to have played a significant role in financing the distinctive Capitol Records building on Hollywood and Vine, in Los Angeles. Completed in 1956, it was the world's first circular office building and became known as \"the house that Nat built.\" Cole was considered a leading jazz pianist, appearing, for example, in the first Jazz at the Philharmonic concerts (credited on the Mercury Record labels as \"Shorty Nadine,\" apparently derived from the name of his wife at the time).\n\nHis revolutionary lineup of piano, guitar and bass in the time of the big bands became a popular set up for a jazz trio. It was emulated by many musicians, among them Art Tatum, Erroll Garner, Oscar Peterson, Ahmad Jamal, Tommy Flanagan and blues pianists Charles Brown and Ray Charles. He also performed as a pianist on sessions with Lester Young, Red Callender, and Lionel Hampton. The Page Cavanaugh Trio with the same set up as Cole came out of the chute about the same time, at the end of the war. Cole's first mainstream vocal hit was his 1943 recording of one of his compositions, \"Straighten Up and Fly Right,\" based on a black folk tale that his father had used as a theme for a sermon. Johnny Mercer invited him to record it for the fledgling Capitol Records label. It sold over 500,000 copies, and proved that folk-based material could appeal to a wide audience. Although Nat would never be considered a rocker, the song can be seen as anticipating the first rock and roll records. Indeed, Bo Diddley, who performed similar transformations of folk material, counted Cole as an influence. Beginning in the late 1940's, Cole began recording and performing more pop-oriented material for mainstream audiences, often accompanied by a string orchestra. His stature as a popular icon was cemented during this period by hits such as \"The Christmas Song\" (Cole recorded the tune four times: June 14, 1946 as a pure Trio recording; August 19, 1946 with an added string section; August 24, 1953; and again in 1961 for the double album, The Nat King Cole Story. This final version, recorded in stereo, is the one most often heard today. ), \"Nature Boy\" (1948), \"Mona Lisa\" (1950), \"Too Young\" (the #1 song in 1951), and his signature tune \"Unforgettable\" (1951). While this shift to pop music led some jazz critics and fans to accuse Cole of selling out, he never totally abandoned his jazz roots; as late as 1956, for instance, he recorded an all-jazz album, After Midnight. [Harold Arlen - It's Only a Paper Moon]\nThe change in musical tastes during the late 1950s meant that Cole's ballad singing did not sell well with younger listeners, despite a successful stab at rock n' roll with \"Send For Me\" (peaked at #6 pop). Along with his contemporaries Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett, Cole found that the pop singles chart had been almost entirely taken over by youth-oriented acts. In 1960, Nat's long-time collaborator Nelson Riddle left Capitol Records for Frank Sinatra's newly formed Reprise Records label. Riddle and Cole recorded one final hit album Wild Is Love, based on lyrics by Ray Rasch and Dotty Wayne. Cole later retooled the concept album into an off-Broadway show, I'm With You. Cole, a heavy smoker who would smoke as much as three packets of cigarettes a day, died of lung cancer on February 15, 1965, while still at the height of his singing career. The day before he died, he did a radio interview, stating: \"I am feeling better than ever. I think I've finally got this cancer licked.\" [8919 Courage \/ 8919 Nat King Cole \/ 8918 Bernstein]\n\nThe trio, however, was one of the first bands to be accepted to these “white” clubs. In 1941 the band went on a national tour. After touring for a few months they settled in New York where they performed at top jazz clubs. In 1942 Wesley Prince was drafted, he was replaced by Johnny Miller. With Miller the group moved back to Los Angeles where they did a series of performances at club “331”. One year later the trio was signed to Capitol Records. They recorded “Straighten Up and Fly Right”, which became a hit in 1944***. More hits the group made with Capitol in this period were “Get Your Kicks on Route 66\" and \"For Sentimental Reasons,\" amongst others. The late 1940s were a busy time for the trio. From 1946 till 1950 they filled the weekly radio program “Kraft Music Hall.” Together with pianist Eddy Duchin they gave young skillful artists the chance to reach a large audience. \"You have no idea how much satisfaction I got from the acceptance of the trio, because we opened the way for countless other small groups, units that before were strictly for cocktail lounges,\" Cole told Down Beat in 1957. In the same period the trio also played in a few movies, including “Breakfast in Hollywood”, “See my lawyer” and “The Stork Club.”\nIn 1946 Nat met the singer Maria Ellington (not related to The Duke, although she sang in his band for a short time) and fell in love with her. After divorcing Nadine he married Maria on March 28, 1948. Influenced by Maria, Nat radically moved away from jazz with the major hit “The Christmas Song” (December 1946.) “The Christmas Song” was the first song in which Nat sung rather than played the piano, with string section accompaniment. In 1947 Oscar Moore decided to leave the trio, Irving Ashby took his place. Nat more and more desired to become a mainstream artist rather than a jazz pianist. This was made clear in another major hit song: “Nature Boy” (1948.) 1950 - 1960\nNat’s first daughter, Natalie (nicknamed “Sweetie”) was born on February 6, 1950. A few months later Nat released the ballad “Mona Lisa” (that stayed on the charts for a record amount of weeks.) “Mona Lisa” permanently changed Nat’s career. The other members of the Cole King Trio had become Nat’s background music, this caused irritations and in 1955 the trio split up. Nat now gained great fame as a solo singer, many of his new fans didn’t even know he used to be a jazz pianist. During the 50’s he made success with \"Unforgettable,\" \"Too Young,\" \"Answer Me, My Love,\" and \"Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup.\" In 1956 Nat was asked to start an own TV show for NBC. This was quite an event: never before a major TV company had asked a Negro to host a show. The show was popular and got good ratings, but Nat never knew to find a sponsor. Businesses were afraid that white southern audiences would associate their products with a Negro. This caused the show to be cancelled after only one year of airtime. Nat did appear on the big screen another few times: in the movie “St. Louis Blues”(1958) for example, and in “The Nat King Cole Story”(1955), an autobiographic film. For a complete list of movies Nat appeared in, see the filmography below. Mid-fifties Nat and Maria adopted Maria’s sister’s daughter Carol, after both of Carol’s parents had died. In 1959 they adopted a boy whom they called Nat Kelly. Plagued by the popularity of Rock and Roll and upcoming artists like Johnny Mathis and Harry Belafonte, Nat’s career went a bit downhill in the late fifties. To prevent this he organized a touring concert show called “Sights and Sounds.” The show presented a group of young dancers and singers who called themselves the “Merry Young Souls.”\n1960 - 1965\nEven though Nat and Maria never thought they would get any more children of their own, in 1961 Maria got pregnant and gave birth to twins: Casey (named after baseball legend Casey Stengel) and Timolin. Nat’s career knew a revival in the early 1960s after he recorded the pop songs \"Ramblin' Rose\" and \"Those Lazy, Hazy, Crazy Days of Summer\" that both came on #1 in the American charts. Late 1964 Nat was diagnosed with lung cancer.\n\n- Search The Registry\n- Teacher’s Forum\n- Youth Programs\n- About Us\n- Creating Support\n- My Account\nNat King Cole\n*This date remembers Nat King Cole, born in 1919. He was a Black musician and singer. Nathaniel Adams Cole was born in Montgomery, Alabama, but grew up in Chicago. In 1937, after touring with a Black musical revue, he began playing in jazz clubs in Los Angeles. There he formed the King Cole Trio, with guitarist Oscar Moore and bassist Wesley Prince, in 1939. With his compact, syncopated backup chords and clean, spare, melodic phrases, Cole emphasized the piano as a solo, rather than a rhythm, instrument in his jazz arrangements. Commercial success came with his singing. After Straighten Up and Fly Right (1943), Cole gradually abandoned jazz piano for popular vocals. Among his other hits were Nature Boy, Mona Lisa, Too Young, and Unforgettable. After his marriage to Maria Hawkins Ellington, his daughter Natalie Maria Cole was born in Los Angeles, CA. Cole toured internationally and appeared in motion pictures. He first came to prominence as a jazz pianist but reached enormous popularity with his warm, relaxed, somewhat breathy-voiced ballad singing. He died February 15, 1965 in Santa Monica, California. ACSAP Biographical Dictionary\nR. R. Bowker Co., Copyright 1980\n\nFrank Sinatra transformed popular music. Often cited as the single finest interpreter of American standards, he influenced generations of vocalists such as Nat King Cole and Carmen McRae by focusing on phrasing and matching narrative nuance and emotional naturalism with amazing breathing control. In the 1930s, Sinatra starting bringing back \"old\" songs by such masters as Cole Porter while he was still a Big Band singer. He became a national institution in the '40s, and even though Ray Charles has praised the flawless technique of this Columbia period, Sinatra kept evolving. Starting in the '50s he concentrated on groundbreaking concept albums and a fresh Big Band sound with master arranger Nelson Riddle. Sinatra explored every nuance of emotion on these Capitol and Reprise albums and influenced the work of Ella Fitzgerald and Peggy Lee. Beginning in the '70s, when rock ruled, his voice and output became erratic but some brilliant work remains. Though Sinatra always viewed himself as a popular singer, jazz musicians hold his work in the highest esteem. Miles Davis and Lester Young often interpreted standards through his versions and avant-gardist John Zorn has said that in his own way, Frank Sinatra was as much a jazz improviser as Charlie Parker.\n\nNat King Cole (100 Lyrics)\nNathaniel Adams Coles (March 17, 1919 \/ February 15, 1965), known professionally as Nat \"King\" Cole, was an American United States musician who first came to prominence as a leading jazz pianist.

These are mostly songs and singers that, in their time, became a significant part of American culture. In large part, the song and singer became famous because of each other, and so these versions became famous--not just the song, and not just the singer. I want you to think about what makes a song and singer go beyond being famous to the point it becomes part of the larger culture. If you are uncomfortable with this assignment, please let me know and I will give you an alternative assignment to complete. I have posted these songs on a private page on my personal website because I can embed them directly. On CompassNet I can only make them so you can download them and I think this will be easier for you. 1. Choose FIVE songs from the list below. Don’t just choose the first five. Look around a little and find some that look fun or at least interesting. Listen to the songs. 2. After you decide which song you like best, answer the two questions I asked (there are two questions below each song). You only need to answer the questions for the song you liked most. You will need to Google and think a little to answer these questions, but the answers are available. 3. Pick the song you personally liked least. I want you to explain why it might have become popular. Why might other people have liked it? 4. Once you have done the required five songs, you may do more for extra credit. There are two options for extra credit. One: you can answer the two questions for more of the songs you listened to. OR, there is an extra credit section below. Follow the directions. I will give you two points of extra credit for every additional two questions you answer, or each of the compare\/contrast options you complete. The maximum you may earn in extra credit is ten points. This assignment is due by January 6, 2016. Five songs should not be hard if you start right away and do a little each day. If you wait until the end, it will be hard. So please don't procrastinate. I estimate each song will take you about 10 minutes to listen and then answer the questions. Have fun! I can think of far worse homework assignments. \"Believe\" Josh Groban\nThis song is not yet a classic. It came from a movie that didn't do all that well. But, every year I feel like I hear it more and more. I think it might be becoming a classic. Listen to the music and think of the way it makes you feel. Question 1: What sort of emotions and images does it call up in your mind? Question 2: Do you think this song will ever become a classic, like \"Frosty\" or \"Rudolph\"? Why or why not? (Be specific. \"Blue Christmas\" Elvis Presley\nElvis Presley was an enormously influential performer. Most young people in his era loved him. Many other people thought he was inspired by the devil. Today, some people still love him, others think he is incredibly tacky. Listen to this song and tell me what you think. Question 1: Do you like his voice? Why or why not? Question 2: What was the nickname people gave Elvis Presley? The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire) Nat King Cole\nNat King Cole is said to have had one of the smoothest voices ever. He has a famous daughter who you might have heard sing on the radio. Question 1: What presidents consulted with Nat King Cole? Question 2: What caused Cole's death? \"Frosty the Snowman\" Jimmy Durante\nIf you've seen the cartoon version of Frosty the Snowman, you've heard Jimmy Durante sing this song. Durante was another popular performer in his day. He started out performing in vaudeville singing, dancing, and doing comedy. If you listen, though, you can tell he doesn't have the nicest, smoothest voice. Question 1: Who was the original artist to record this song? Question 2: What was Jimmy Durante's nickname and to what did it refer? \"The Most Wonderful Time of the Year\" Andy Williams\nAt one time, Andy Williams received the largest contract a recording artist had ever earned before. He performed a song for a movie that became famous and became his theme song. Question 1: What was that song? Question 2: At which famous politician's funeral did Williams sing? \"Happy Xmas (War is Over)\" John Lennon\nQuestion 1: Explain what historical even this song is connected to? Question 2: Who else helped with the performing and possibly the writing of this song? Question 2: John Lennon belonged to a famous musical group. What is that group?\n\nA lot of people think that Earl Hines might be the forerunner of Bop, because he played a lot of single-finger lines. That was his style. And as you say, Nat Cole must have heard him and must have been influenced by him. He recollected hanging out in the alley behind the Grand Terrace in Chicago in the 1930’s, and checking him out. But this brings me to a question, which is the formation of your aesthetic, the pianists you heard, how you began to assimilate styles. The biographies say that you were mightily impressed by Art Tatum, Teddy Wilson and Fats Waller, the main subject of your recent recording, Handful Of Keys. A few words about Fats Waller. HJ: Well, I remember very clearly hearing Fats Waller on the radio every morning when I was going to junior high school. There were two radio stations, CKLW and KCLK; one of them was in Canada, in Windsor, and the other one was in Detroit. They used to play many records of Fats Waller. He always impressed me as a very rhythmic pianist, and he had a happy sound. Another pianist who had that same kind of sound, but a different sound, was Erroll Garner. Erroll Garner had that happy feeling. When you listened to his music, you felt uplifted, generally. It put you on a higher level of enjoyment. Fats Waller had that. And what a great way to start off the day! Because before we left the house to go to school, we were listening to Fats Waller. Duke Ellington gave me a different kind of feeling. Of course, it was all big band. But Duke, in spite of what some people might think, was an excellent pianist. I guess when the band was playing, of course, he preferred to let the musicians in the band take the spotlight as far as solo playing was concerned…\nThey were extensions of him anyway. HJ: Exactly. I always liked Duke’s piano-playing style. And his ideas, of course, were very innovative. Although Duke, if he were here today, would tell you that Willie The Lion Smith influenced him quite a bit. And when you listen to some of the Willie The Lion Smith piano solos (and I have some of them, by the way), you can hear the later Duke Ellington. So Duke was greatly influenced in that respect. I mean, everybody is. That’s not unusual. You have to have a role model. And I’m sure that Willie was one of Duke’s role models. The others were probably some other pianists that we don’t even know about…\nWell, it’s very interesting how styles were disseminated even at a time when there was much less universal media from one part of the country to another, just because of the traveling life of musicians — and of course, from records. HJ: Yes, records. There weren’t as many, but… Or just traveling musicians who would go from place to place. Some people like to describe them as itinerant. I don’t. [LAUGHS] Maybe they had to move from place to place because there was no work where they were, and so they were trying to find work. I’m sure the basic reason for their travel was not that they loved it; it’s just they had to do it in order to survive. But you mentioned Earl Hines. Well, of course, Earl Hines was a single-line pianist. That’s the best way to describe his playing. He had a very good band in the 1930’s and early ’40s. As a matter of fact, Sarah Vaughan used to sing in his band at one time. She got her start in that band. HJ: That’s right. And he had violins at one time, by the way. Well, he had to take care of a whole show at the Grand Terrace in Chicago, so a lot of his repertoire had to be geared toward the dancers and the comedians, and deal with the whole range of entertainment. HJ: That’s right. Art Tatum was in the Midwest quite a bit in the 1930’s. He was from Toledo, Ohio. HJ: Yes, he was. There was another pianist, Lannie Scott, who you may not have heard of (or maybe you have). Lannie and Art used to work opposite each other in the same club, Val’s in the Alley in Toledo. Then later on I met Lannie in Detroit. As a matter of fact, I worked opposite Lannie Scott. But they had similar styles.",
    "answer": "In the 1940s, Nat King Cole's musical career evolved significantly. Initially known as a jazz pianist, Cole began to incorporate vocals into his performances, which led to a wider audience and commercial success. His first mainstream vocal hit, \"Straighten Up and Fly Right,\" was recorded in 1943 and became a major success, selling over 500,000 copies. This song was based on a black folk tale that his father had used as a theme for a sermon, demonstrating Cole's ability to blend different musical styles.\n\nAs the decade progressed, Cole's popularity grew, and he became one of the most celebrated musicians of his time. He continued to release hit songs, including \"The Christmas Song\" (1946), \"Nature Boy\" (1948), \"Mona Lisa\" (1950), \"Too Young\" (1951), and his signature tune \"Unforgettable\" (1951). Cole's ability to sing ballads with a soft, warm voice and his sophisticated style of singing captivated audiences, making him a household name.\n\nDespite some jazz critics and fans accusing Cole of selling out as he shifted towards pop music, his influence on the music industry remained significant. He paved the way for other musicians and helped break down racial barriers in the music scene, becoming one of the most influential figures in American music during the 1940s.",
