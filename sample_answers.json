{"id":425,"question":"What specific medications are not recommended for treating dependent personality disorder and why?","gold":"Benzodiazepines are not recommended for treating dependent personality disorder. The reason for this is that individuals with dependent personality disorder have an increased risk of developing dependency on substances, including drugs. Benzodiazepines are a class of drugs that are primarily used to treat anxiety, insomnia, and seizures. They work by enhancing the effect of a neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which reduces neuronal excitability.\n\nWhile benzodiazepines can be effective for managing symptoms of anxiety or sleep disturbances, they carry a significant risk of dependence, especially in individuals who have a predisposition towards dependency, as is the case with dependent personality disorder. Over time, the body can develop tolerance to the effects of benzodiazepines, leading to the need for higher doses, and discontinuation can result in withdrawal symptoms.\n\nAdditionally, benzodiazepines can exacerbate the dependent personality traits such as clinging behavior and fear of being alone, potentially making the disorder worse rather than better.\n\nFor these reasons, other medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), are typically preferred for treating symptoms associated with dependent personality disorder, such as anxiety or depression.","doc_ids":"['<urn:uuid:a113fa3d-8d1f-48ed-aa75-530129e034f5>']","texts":"['(See also Overview of Personality Disorders.)\\nIn patients with dependent personality disorder, the need to be taken care of results in loss of their autonomy and interests.

They use submissiveness to try to get other people to take care of them.\\nPatients with this disorder typically require much reassurance and advice when making ordinary decisions.

Even when anger is appropriate, they do not get angry at friends and co-workers for fear of losing their support.\\nBecause these patients are sure that they cannot do anything on their own, they have difficulty starting a new task and working independently, and they avoid tasks that require taking responsibility. They present themselves as incompetent and needing constant help and reassurance.

This disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of dependent and submissive behavior. Individuals with dependent personality disorder demonstrate a clinging helplessness and docility and are searching for support and reassurance. Persons with this disorder subordinate their own needs to those of others, and in a submissive way get others to assume responsibility for major areas of their lives. They will appear self-deprecating. They feel a sense of inferiority and are willing to abdicate self-responsibility and self-control to others. They often times will tolerate intimidation and abuse in hopes of avoiding loneliness and abandonment. They may experience intense discomfort when left alone even for brief periods of time. Freud described this type of personality as being characterized by pessimism, fear of sexuality, self-doubt, passivity, suggestibility, and lack of perseverance. Persons with this disorder tend to avoid positions of responsibility and have difficulty making decisions without an excessive amount of advice and reassurance from others. They may become anxious if asked to assume leadership roles, as they prefer the submissive role. It is more common in women than in men. Persons with chronic physical illness in childhood may be prone to this disorder. How is it diagnosed? History: The psychiatric interview and mental status exam are the primary methods utilized by the practitioner. The physician looks for symptoms of a pervasive and excessive need to be taken care of that lead to submissive and clinging behavior and fears of separation, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts. According to the DSM-IV, there are eight categories of identifiable behaviors called personality traits for the dependent personality. The individual must present five or more of the following eight personality traits to justify the diagnosis:\n- has difficulty making everyday decisions with an excessive amount of advice and reassurance from others;\n- needs others to assume responsibility for most major areas of his or her life;\n- has difficulty expressing disagreement with others because of fear of loss of support or approval;\n- has difficulty initiating projects or doing things on his or her own (because of a lack of self-confidence in judgment);\n- goes to excessive lengths to obtain nurturance and support from others, to the point of volunteering to do things that are unpleasant;\n- feels uncomfortable or helpless when alone because of exaggerated fears of being unable to care for himself or herself;\n- urgently seeks another relationship as a source of care and support when a close relationship ends;\n- or is unrealistically preoccupied with fears of being left to take care of himself or herself. Physical exam is not helpful in diagnosing this disorder. Observation of the individual's orientation, dress, mannerisms, behavior and content of speech provide essential signs to diagnose the illness. Tests: Various psychological tests can be performed to help identify and classify personality disorders. The interpretations of these tests are used in conjunction with the history. How is Dependent Personality Disorder treated? Treatment requires a trusting relationship between the therapist and patient. This can be difficult as motivation for treatment often comes from someone other than the person with the disorder. Psychological treatment may include family and group therapy, group living situations and self-help groups. Behavior-changing techniques involve the learning of social skills, reinforcement of appropriate behavior, setting limits on inappropriate behavior, learning to express feelings, self analysis of behavior and accepting accountability for actions. No medication will cure or treat a personality disorder. Drugs may be prescribed for treatment of additional illnesses:\n- Antidepressants for depression; anxiety medications. - Antipsychotic drugs for psychoses. Prozac (Fluoxetine), Valium (Diazepam), Ativan (Lorazepam)\nWhat might complicate it? Individuals with dependent personalities require a relationship to feel validated. Complications will most likely occur when difficulty arises in relating to other people at work or at home. Loss of the person upon whom they are dependent can lead to an episode of major depression, generalized anxiety, or panic. At work, particular problems might arise if they are assigned to work independently or without close supervision.\n\nPatients with borderline personality disorder, unlike those with dependent personality disorder, vacillate between submissiveness and rageful hostility. Avoidant personality disorder: Patients with this disorder are also too frightened to submit to the same degree of control as patients with dependent personality disorder. Patients with avoidant personality disorder withdraw until they are sure they will be accepted without criticism; in contrast, those with dependent personality disorder seek out and try to maintain relationships with others. Histrionic personality disorder: Patients with this disorder seek attention rather than reassurance (as do those with dependent personality disorder), but they are more disinhibited. They are more flamboyant and actively seek attention; those with dependent personality disorder are self-effacing and shy. General treatment of dependent personality disorder is similar to that for all personality disorders. Psychodynamic psychotherapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy that focus on examining fears of independence and difficulties with assertiveness can help patients with dependent personality disorder. Clinicians should be careful not to promote dependency in the therapy relationship. Evidence about drug therapy for dependent personality disorder is sparse. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), which are effective in avoidant personality disorder, may be effective, as may selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Benzodiazepines are not used because patients with dependent personality disorder have an increased risk of drug dependency.\n\nOne of the most difficult things is wanting to leave that relationship, for reasons related to DPD or for the million other everyday reasons why relationships end. You might feel sad, even guilty, about wanting a different life for yourself, or you might worry about the repercussions should you leave. Reba, for instance, feared that Nico might be unable to take care of himself without her—or worse, that he might harm himself if she broke things off with him. While Reba didn’t really want to end the relationship, she also resented feeling trapped. What she learned later was that dependent personality disorder was a real thing, and not just a catchphrase for someone who acts a little clingy. More than that, she learned that DPD was something that could be treated. There was help available, if they were willing to seek it out. It took time and a lot of patience, but eventually, Reba convinced Nico to find that help at a local residential treatment facility. Call for a Free Confidential Assessment.877-727-4343\nTaking Care Of Yourself in a Dependent Relationship\nOne thing that Reba learned was that she was allowed to take care of herself. When in a relationship with someone with DPD, it is important to practice self-care. You can’t, and certainly shouldn’t, spend 100% of your time making sure your significant other feels affirmed and making their decisions for them. It isn’t helpful, it is stressful for you, and over time it can actually weaken, rather than strengthen, your relationship. It is important to set boundaries, being firm but caring. It is important to encourage them to develop on their own, to take steps on their own. It’s important to help them learn to live for themselves, and not for others. But at the end, there is only so much you can do. The most important thing is to recognize that dependent personality disorder isn’t a “quirk” or a phase your loved one is going through, but a recognizable and treatable mental health disorder. And encouraging them to get better means encouraging treatment that is actually helpful. The Importance of Treatment in Dependent Personality Disorder\nLong-term treatment for dependent personality disorder is vitally important, due to the nature of the disorder. It takes time to help someone see themselves. It also takes expertise. Long-term care facilities with experts in DPD are skilled at not letting the patient form a dependent bond on them. That’s the danger with non-experts—your partner can easily transfer their dependence onto another figure. Instead, they need to work to have a healthy and independent relationship. Group sessions, meanwhile, reinforce positive and non-dependent relationships. People with DPD need to learn new ways of communicating with others, starting with how they think of themselves. Additionally, while there’s no medication to specifically treat dependent personality disorder, some may be prescribed for related or co-occurring disorders, such as anxiety or depression. It is about managing symptoms, managing expectations, and managing boundaries. That’s what Reba learned as Nico went through therapy. She learned how they could work together to make things better. In the end, it was just like any relationship—a lot of good, some bad, and some things they’d always have to work on. But now, they are doing so together.

As a disorder, the personality type first appeared in a War Department Technical Bulletin in 1945 and later in the first edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in 1952 (American Psychiatric Association 1952) as a subtype of passive-aggressive personality disorder. Since then, a surprising number of studies have upheld the descriptive validity of dependent personality traits, viewed as submissiveness, oral character traits, oral dependence, or passive dependence, or as a constellation of both pathological and adaptive traits under the rubric dependency. Dependent Personality Disorder\n- DSM-IV Criteria\n- Presenting Complaints\n- Psychodynamics and the Functional Maintenance of Dependent Behavior\n- L Problems Arising in Psychotherapy\n- L Individual Dynamic Psychotherapy\n- L Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy\n- L Group Psychotherapy\n- Biological Therapies\n- Residential and Day Treatment Therapies\n- Separation Anxiety and Dependent Personality\nDSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association 1994) emphasizes two sets of traits (Table 88-1): 1) dependency (criteria 1-5) and 2) insecure attachment (criteria 6-8). The description overlaps that of asthenic personality disorder in the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, which emphasizes compliance and a weak response to the demands of daily life. The treatment literature is limited largely to case descriptions and uncontrolled studies, although several controlled treatment trials with admixtures of personality disorders address issues relevant to dependent personality disorder. Nonetheless, there is an apparent consensus in the clinical literature that the treatment of dependent personality disorder is often successful. This is indirectly supported by the relative lack of articles that report failures or focus on difficulties in treatment, in contrast to the plethora of such reports for other personality disorders. Dependency is a universal personality trait; however, this review is limited to reports that are relevant to the treatment of the personality disorder only. Although dependent personality is common in the general population - the Midtown Manhattan Study found that it was present in 2.5% of the entire sample (Langer and Michael 1963) - it often occurs with other personality disorders, especially borderline, histrionic, and avoidant personality disorders (Bornstein 1995b; Hirschfeld et al. 1991; Zanarini et al. 1998), and less consistently with self-defeating, passive-aggressive, compulsive, schizotypal, and paranoid types (Bornstein 1995b; Reich 1996; Skodol et al. 1996); treatment should be modified accordingly. Patterns of comorbidity vary widely depending on sample source, reason for selection (e.g., major depression), and assessment method. This review does not include a discussion of managing the dependency that often accompanies chronic major psychiatric syndromes such as schizophrenia or unremitting depression (Bornstein 1992). However, in noting that Axis I disorders such as depression often increase dependency, Skodol et al. (1996) suggested that if maladaptive dependency does not improve after the treated symptomatic disorder improves, then it might become the focus of treatment in its own right.

Histrionic personality disorder\nSomeone with histrionic personality disorder (HPD) feels they need to be the center of attention in all situations. This may lead to overdramatic behaviors that others might perceive as odd and inappropriate. If you live with HPD, you may feel anxious and frustrated if others ignore you or give more attention to someone else over you. You may also place a lot of importance on your physical appearance and modify it in a way that you feel will call more attention to you. Cluster C personality disorders\nPeople with cluster C personality disorders usually live with strong feelings of anxiety, doubt, and fear. 1. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder\nObsessive-compulsive personality disorder is not the same as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Someone with the personality disorder is likely not aware of their behavior, while someone with OCD realizes their obsessions and compulsions aren’t rational. If you live with an obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, you may strive for perfection in all aspects of your life. To accomplish that, you might find yourself taking on way more than you can deal with, and you might feel no achievement is ever enough. Other people might regard you as very reliable, tidy, and dependable, but also inflexible, stubborn, and strict. This may be because you usually have a hard time adapting to change or changing opinions. You may also take a long time making any decision and completing tasks daily because you want everything to be perfect. When you can’t control the situation or things change around you, you might feel extremely anxious and vulnerable. 2. Dependent personality disorder\nSomeone with a dependent personality disorder is usually submissive, letting other people assume control over their lives and decisions. There might also be a strong need for others to take care of you. If you live with this personality disorder, you might have a hard time making decisions on your own. You’d rather ask for other people’s opinions or go with what they decide in every situation. You may also find yourself extremely hurt if someone criticizes or rejects you. You may be perceived as a “people pleaser” and could feel very anxious when you’re alone. You might not feel comfortable doing anything on your own. You may also rely on your relationships and become depressed if one of them ends. 3. Avoidant personality disorder\nA diagnosis of avoidant personality disorder may mean you’re extremely fearful of rejection and abandonment. This could lead you to avoid almost all social activities and events, even when internally you wish you’d go. With this personality disorder, you may also feel insecure around other people, worrying that you may say something silly or inappropriate. Sometimes, if placed in a situation where you have to interact with others, you may end up blushing, crying, and trembling. People with this personality disorder feel the need to connect to others and establish close relationships, but they don’t because of their insecurities. This, in turn, makes them very upset. Research shows that long-term psychotherapy is the most effective treatment for all personality disorders. It may help you explore your thoughts and emotions and how these affect you and other people. Therapy can also help you manage some of your symptoms so that you can cope with some situations more effectively. In some instances, some symptoms might be treated with medications such as antidepressants. But this isn’t true for every personality disorder or every individual case. Sometimes, your doctor might recommend including other health professionals in your treatment. They may also suggest your close relatives join you in a few therapy sessions, if you approve. Because personality disorders all have different symptoms and triggers, they’re not all treated in the same way. The type of approach your doctor chooses will depend on your symptoms, their intensity, and your personal and medical history. These are some of the most commonly used types of psychotherapy for personality disorders:\nTreatment for personality disorders is typically long term. It requires a strong commitment and persistence on your part. But you may experience relief and learn how to manage some emotions if you continue your treatment. Personality disorders are complex mental health conditions beyond a given set of behaviors and emotions. This is why only a trained professional is equipped to make a proper diagnosis.

However, there are medications that can reduce or treat the associated symptoms such as stress, anxiety, confusion, agitation, or depression. The top drugs used in the treatment of schizotypal personality disorder treatment can be categorized as:\n1) Antidepressants: These are used when the schizotypal personality disorder diagnosis indicates depression as a major contributing cause for the personality disorder. Some of the commonly used antidepressants for schizotypal personality disorder treatment include selective serontonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). 2) Stimulants: Stimulants are used in schizotypal personality disorder treatment when the patient displays excessive depression or isolation. Stimulants increase awareness, productivity, motivation, endurance, and wakefulness and keep the patient alert. This can reduce isolation and paranoia. Some examples of stimulants used for the treatment of this type of personality disorder are caffeine, nicotine, amphetamines, norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI), and norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRIs). 3) Anti-anxiety medication: If the schizotypal personality disorder diagnosis indicates anxiety as a trigger of paranoid tendencies or other symptoms exhibited by the patient, anti-anxiety medication can be used under a qualified physician’s guidance. Some categories of these medications are SSRIs, azapirones, benzodiazepines, preganalin, and a few other over-the-counter medications for milder cases. Valium, Ativan, Librium, and Xanax are some examples. 4) Mood stabilizers: These are used for schizotypal personality disorder treatment in circumstances where the patient displays mood swings and depression. These medications control mood swings and stabilize mood. This medication also reduces manic behavior caused by paranoia in schizotypal patients. Some of the mood stabilizers used for this treatment are anticonvulsants such as valproic acid, lamotrigine, and oxcarbaxepine. 5) Antipsychotic medication: This type of schizotypal personality disorder medication is used as a tranquilizer to calm down patients who display psychosis including delusions, disordered thoughts, or hallucinations. This medication has side effects and needs to be taken only under the guidance of a qualified physician. Some of the side effects include vomiting, nausea, reduced blood pressure, and headache. The most commonly used mood stabilizers are butyrophenones, thixanthenes, and phenothiazines.

They may see themselves as being “stupid” and may seek someone who is more dominant to take care of them. People with this disorder may avoid responsibility and making any decisions. There are currently no scientific findings as to the cause of development of dependent personality disorder. Dependent Personality Disorder Characteristics\n- The person has trouble with making daily decisions without asking for reassurance and advice from others\n- Needs others to assume responsibility for most areas of that person’s life\n- Has trouble expressing disagreements with others in fear of upsetting them or losing their support\/approval\n- Struggles with initiating projects on their own\n- Goes through long lengths to receive reassurance and support from others\n- Feels helpless and uncomfortable when solely by themselves\n- Quickly seeks out another relationship shortly after one has ended for care and support\n- Is unrealistically preoccupied with fears of being left to take care of oneself\nAvoidant personality disorder is often diagnosed in adulthood, because the characteristics are longstanding and a child has not been fully developed yet. Those who have this disorder may often be very conscientious of their movements and speech, which may, in turn, prompt others to ridicule them, thus further confirming their self-doubts. People who have this disorder may be typically considered as shy, isolated, lonely, and timid. Avoidant Personality Disorder Characteristics\n- The person avoids activities that involve a lot of interpersonal communication, because they are afraid of criticism, disapproval, or rejection\n- Doesn’t feel comfortable getting involved with someone unless they know they are liked\n- Shows restrained within intimate relationships due to fear of being shamed or made fun of\n- Is preoccupied with consistent thoughts of being ridiculed in social situations\n- Is inhibited in personal relationships because they feel inadequate\n- Views themselves as socially inept, unappealing, and views themselves as having less worth than others\n- Is scared to take risks or try new things due to fear of embarrassment\nBoth personality disorders typically require psychotherapy to receive treatment. If someone suspects their loved one may suffer from either one of these disorders, it is best for them to reach out to a doctor.

This disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of dependent and submissive behavior. Individuals with dependent personality disorder demonstrate a clinging helplessness and docility and are searching for support and reassurance. Persons with this disorder subordinate their own needs to those of others, and in a submissive way get others to assume responsibility for major areas of their lives. They will appear self-deprecating. They feel a sense of inferiority and are willing to abdicate self-responsibility and self-control to others. They often times will tolerate intimidation and abuse in hopes of avoiding loneliness and abandonment. They may experience intense discomfort when left alone even for brief periods of time. Freud described this type of personality as being characterized by pessimism, fear of sexuality, self-doubt, passivity, suggestibility, and lack of perseverance. Persons with this disorder tend to avoid positions of responsibility and have difficulty making decisions without an excessive amount of advice and reassurance from others. They may become anxious if asked to assume leadership roles, as they prefer the submissive role. It is more common in women than in men. Persons with chronic physical illness in childhood may be prone to this disorder. How is it diagnosed? History: The psychiatric interview and mental status exam are the primary methods utilized by the practitioner. The physician looks for symptoms of a pervasive and excessive need to be taken care of that lead to submissive and clinging behavior and fears of separation, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts. According to the DSM-IV, there are eight categories of identifiable behaviors called personality traits for the dependent personality. The individual must present five or more of the following eight personality traits to justify the diagnosis:\n- has difficulty making everyday decisions with an excessive amount of advice and reassurance from others;\n- needs others to assume responsibility for most major areas of his or her life;\n- has difficulty expressing disagreement with others because of fear of loss of support or approval;\n- has difficulty initiating projects or doing things on his or her own (because of a lack of self-confidence in judgment);\n- goes to excessive lengths to obtain nurturance and support from others, to the point of volunteering to do things that are unpleasant;\n- feels uncomfortable or helpless when alone because of exaggerated fears of being unable to care for himself or herself;\n- urgently seeks another relationship as a source of care and support when a close relationship ends;\n- or is unrealistically preoccupied with fears of being left to take care of himself or herself. Physical exam is not helpful in diagnosing this disorder. Observation of the individual's orientation, dress, mannerisms, behavior and content of speech provide essential signs to diagnose the illness. Tests: Various psychological tests can be performed to help identify and classify personality disorders. The interpretations of these tests are used in conjunction with the history. How is Dependent Personality Disorder treated? Treatment requires a trusting relationship between the therapist and patient. This can be difficult as motivation for treatment often comes from someone other than the person with the disorder. Psychological treatment may include family and group therapy, group living situations and self-help groups. Behavior-changing techniques involve the learning of social skills, reinforcement of appropriate behavior, setting limits on inappropriate behavior, learning to express feelings, self analysis of behavior and accepting accountability for actions. No medication will cure or treat a personality disorder. Drugs may be prescribed for treatment of additional illnesses:\n- Antidepressants for depression; anxiety medications. - Antipsychotic drugs for psychoses. Prozac (Fluoxetine), Valium (Diazepam), Ativan (Lorazepam)\nWhat might complicate it? Individuals with dependent personalities require a relationship to feel validated. Complications will most likely occur when difficulty arises in relating to other people at work or at home. Loss of the person upon whom they are dependent can lead to an episode of major depression, generalized anxiety, or panic. At work, particular problems might arise if they are assigned to work independently or without close supervision.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:cfefe863-c3cd-41f7-92ab-c5908ad04624>"]},{"passage":"Patients with borderline personality disorder, unlike those with dependent personality disorder, vacillate between submissiveness and rageful hostility. Avoidant personality disorder: Patients with this disorder are also too frightened to submit to the same degree of control as patients with dependent personality disorder. Patients with avoidant personality disorder withdraw until they are sure they will be accepted without criticism; in contrast, those with dependent personality disorder seek out and try to maintain relationships with others. Histrionic personality disorder: Patients with this disorder seek attention rather than reassurance (as do those with dependent personality disorder), but they are more disinhibited. They are more flamboyant and actively seek attention; those with dependent personality disorder are self-effacing and shy. General treatment of dependent personality disorder is similar to that for all personality disorders. Psychodynamic psychotherapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy that focus on examining fears of independence and difficulties with assertiveness can help patients with dependent personality disorder. Clinicians should be careful not to promote dependency in the therapy relationship. Evidence about drug therapy for dependent personality disorder is sparse. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), which are effective in avoidant personality disorder, may be effective, as may selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Benzodiazepines are not used because patients with dependent personality disorder have an increased risk of drug dependency.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:a113fa3d-8d1f-48ed-aa75-530129e034f5>"]},{"passage":"One of the most difficult things is wanting to leave that relationship, for reasons related to DPD or for the million other everyday reasons why relationships end. You might feel sad, even guilty, about wanting a different life for yourself, or you might worry about the repercussions should you leave. Reba, for instance, feared that Nico might be unable to take care of himself without her—or worse, that he might harm himself if she broke things off with him. While Reba didn’t really want to end the relationship, she also resented feeling trapped. What she learned later was that dependent personality disorder was a real thing, and not just a catchphrase for someone who acts a little clingy. More than that, she learned that DPD was something that could be treated. There was help available, if they were willing to seek it out. It took time and a lot of patience, but eventually, Reba convinced Nico to find that help at a local residential treatment facility. Call for a Free Confidential Assessment.877-727-4343\nTaking Care Of Yourself in a Dependent Relationship\nOne thing that Reba learned was that she was allowed to take care of herself. When in a relationship with someone with DPD, it is important to practice self-care. You can’t, and certainly shouldn’t, spend 100% of your time making sure your significant other feels affirmed and making their decisions for them. It isn’t helpful, it is stressful for you, and over time it can actually weaken, rather than strengthen, your relationship. It is important to set boundaries, being firm but caring. It is important to encourage them to develop on their own, to take steps on their own. It’s important to help them learn to live for themselves, and not for others. But at the end, there is only so much you can do. The most important thing is to recognize that dependent personality disorder isn’t a “quirk” or a phase your loved one is going through, but a recognizable and treatable mental health disorder. And encouraging them to get better means encouraging treatment that is actually helpful. The Importance of Treatment in Dependent Personality Disorder\nLong-term treatment for dependent personality disorder is vitally important, due to the nature of the disorder. It takes time to help someone see themselves. It also takes expertise. Long-term care facilities with experts in DPD are skilled at not letting the patient form a dependent bond on them. That’s the danger with non-experts—your partner can easily transfer their dependence onto another figure. Instead, they need to work to have a healthy and independent relationship. Group sessions, meanwhile, reinforce positive and non-dependent relationships. People with DPD need to learn new ways of communicating with others, starting with how they think of themselves. Additionally, while there’s no medication to specifically treat dependent personality disorder, some may be prescribed for related or co-occurring disorders, such as anxiety or depression. It is about managing symptoms, managing expectations, and managing boundaries. That’s what Reba learned as Nico went through therapy. She learned how they could work together to make things better. In the end, it was just like any relationship—a lot of good, some bad, and some things they’d always have to work on. But now, they are doing so together.

As a disorder, the personality type first appeared in a War Department Technical Bulletin in 1945 and later in the first edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in 1952 (American Psychiatric Association 1952) as a subtype of passive-aggressive personality disorder. Since then, a surprising number of studies have upheld the descriptive validity of dependent personality traits, viewed as submissiveness, oral character traits, oral dependence, or passive dependence, or as a constellation of both pathological and adaptive traits under the rubric dependency. Dependent Personality Disorder\n- DSM-IV Criteria\n- Presenting Complaints\n- Psychodynamics and the Functional Maintenance of Dependent Behavior\n- L Problems Arising in Psychotherapy\n- L Individual Dynamic Psychotherapy\n- L Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy\n- L Group Psychotherapy\n- Biological Therapies\n- Residential and Day Treatment Therapies\n- Separation Anxiety and Dependent Personality\nDSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association 1994) emphasizes two sets of traits (Table 88-1): 1) dependency (criteria 1-5) and 2) insecure attachment (criteria 6-8). The description overlaps that of asthenic personality disorder in the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, which emphasizes compliance and a weak response to the demands of daily life. The treatment literature is limited largely to case descriptions and uncontrolled studies, although several controlled treatment trials with admixtures of personality disorders address issues relevant to dependent personality disorder. Nonetheless, there is an apparent consensus in the clinical literature that the treatment of dependent personality disorder is often successful. This is indirectly supported by the relative lack of articles that report failures or focus on difficulties in treatment, in contrast to the plethora of such reports for other personality disorders. Dependency is a universal personality trait; however, this review is limited to reports that are relevant to the treatment of the personality disorder only. Although dependent personality is common in the general population - the Midtown Manhattan Study found that it was present in 2.5% of the entire sample (Langer and Michael 1963) - it often occurs with other personality disorders, especially borderline, histrionic, and avoidant personality disorders (Bornstein 1995b; Hirschfeld et al. 1991; Zanarini et al. 1998), and less consistently with self-defeating, passive-aggressive, compulsive, schizotypal, and paranoid types (Bornstein 1995b; Reich 1996; Skodol et al. 1996); treatment should be modified accordingly. Patterns of comorbidity vary widely depending on sample source, reason for selection (e.g., major depression), and assessment method. This review does not include a discussion of managing the dependency that often accompanies chronic major psychiatric syndromes such as schizophrenia or unremitting depression (Bornstein 1992). However, in noting that Axis I disorders such as depression often increase dependency, Skodol et al. (1996) suggested that if maladaptive dependency does not improve after the treated symptomatic disorder improves, then it might become the focus of treatment in its own right.

Histrionic personality disorder\nSomeone with histrionic personality disorder (HPD) feels they need to be the center of attention in all situations. This may lead to overdramatic behaviors that others might perceive as odd and inappropriate. If you live with HPD, you may feel anxious and frustrated if others ignore you or give more attention to someone else over you. You may also place a lot of importance on your physical appearance and modify it in a way that you feel will call more attention to you. Cluster C personality disorders\nPeople with cluster C personality disorders usually live with strong feelings of anxiety, doubt, and fear. 1. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder\nObsessive-compulsive personality disorder is not the same as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Someone with the personality disorder is likely not aware of their behavior, while someone with OCD realizes their obsessions and compulsions aren’t rational. If you live with an obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, you may strive for perfection in all aspects of your life. To accomplish that, you might find yourself taking on way more than you can deal with, and you might feel no achievement is ever enough. Other people might regard you as very reliable, tidy, and dependable, but also inflexible, stubborn, and strict. This may be because you usually have a hard time adapting to change or changing opinions. You may also take a long time making any decision and completing tasks daily because you want everything to be perfect. When you can’t control the situation or things change around you, you might feel extremely anxious and vulnerable. 2. Dependent personality disorder\nSomeone with a dependent personality disorder is usually submissive, letting other people assume control over their lives and decisions. There might also be a strong need for others to take care of you. If you live with this personality disorder, you might have a hard time making decisions on your own. You’d rather ask for other people’s opinions or go with what they decide in every situation. You may also find yourself extremely hurt if someone criticizes or rejects you. You may be perceived as a “people pleaser” and could feel very anxious when you’re alone. You might not feel comfortable doing anything on your own. You may also rely on your relationships and become depressed if one of them ends. 3. Avoidant personality disorder\nA diagnosis of avoidant personality disorder may mean you’re extremely fearful of rejection and abandonment. This could lead you to avoid almost all social activities and events, even when internally you wish you’d go. With this personality disorder, you may also feel insecure around other people, worrying that you may say something silly or inappropriate. Sometimes, if placed in a situation where you have to interact with others, you may end up blushing, crying, and trembling. People with this personality disorder feel the need to connect to others and establish close relationships, but they don’t because of their insecurities. This, in turn, makes them very upset. Research shows that long-term psychotherapy is the most effective treatment for all personality disorders. It may help you explore your thoughts and emotions and how these affect you and other people. Therapy can also help you manage some of your symptoms so that you can cope with some situations more effectively. In some instances, some symptoms might be treated with medications such as antidepressants. But this isn’t true for every personality disorder or every individual case. Sometimes, your doctor might recommend including other health professionals in your treatment. They may also suggest your close relatives join you in a few therapy sessions, if you approve. Because personality disorders all have different symptoms and triggers, they’re not all treated in the same way. The type of approach your doctor chooses will depend on your symptoms, their intensity, and your personal and medical history. These are some of the most commonly used types of psychotherapy for personality disorders:\nTreatment for personality disorders is typically long term. It requires a strong commitment and persistence on your part. But you may experience relief and learn how to manage some emotions if you continue your treatment.

The top drugs used in the treatment of schizotypal personality disorder treatment can be categorized as:\n1) Antidepressants: These are used when the schizotypal personality disorder diagnosis indicates depression as a major contributing cause for the personality disorder. Some of the commonly used antidepressants for schizotypal personality disorder treatment include selective serontonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). 2) Stimulants: Stimulants are used in schizotypal personality disorder treatment when the patient displays excessive depression or isolation. Stimulants increase awareness, productivity, motivation, endurance, and wakefulness and keep the patient alert. This can reduce isolation and paranoia. Some examples of stimulants used for the treatment of this type of personality disorder are caffeine, nicotine, amphetamines, norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI), and norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRIs). 3) Anti-anxiety medication: If the schizotypal personality disorder diagnosis indicates anxiety as a trigger of paranoid tendencies or other symptoms exhibited by the patient, anti-anxiety medication can be used under a qualified physician’s guidance. Some categories of these medications are SSRIs, azapirones, benzodiazepines, preganalin, and a few other over-the-counter medications for milder cases. Valium, Ativan, Librium, and Xanax are some examples. 4) Mood stabilizers: These are used for schizotypal personality disorder treatment in circumstances where the patient displays mood swings and depression. These medications control mood swings and stabilize mood. This medication also reduces manic behavior caused by paranoia in schizotypal patients. Some of the mood stabilizers used for this treatment are anticonvulsants such as valproic acid, lamotrigine, and oxcarbaxepine. 5) Antipsychotic medication: This type of schizotypal personality disorder medication is used as a tranquilizer to calm down patients who display psychosis including delusions, disordered thoughts, or hallucinations. This medication has side effects and needs to be taken only under the guidance of a qualified physician. Some of the side effects include vomiting, nausea, reduced blood pressure, and headache.
