{"question":"How did Nat King Cole's musical career evolve in the 1940s?","passages":[{"passage":"Nat King Cole is one of the world’s greatest jazz legends. The records he made in the 1940s have been of major influence on jazz\nmusic. His impact on generations of pianists\nwas not just far-reaching: it was fundamental. Nat is often regarded as the man who made it possible for black musicians to break through in the U.S. music scene. He did not refuse to perform before segregated audiences, for he believed that goodwill and exhibition of his talent were more effective than formal protests in fighting racism. His approach was not always a success: he was a victim of several racial incidents throughout his life. 1919 – 1936\nNathaniel Adams Coles was born on March 17 1919* in Montgomery, Alabama. He was born in a poor family: his father, Edward James Coles sr., was a reverend, his mother Perlina Adams Coles was the choir director of her husband’s church. Even though Nat’s parents had thirteen children, only five of them made it to adulthood. Nat grew up with his brother Edward jr. and his two sisters, Eddie Mae and Evelyn. When Nat was four years old his family moved to Chicago where his father had been offered pastorship of the True Light Baptist Church. In Chicago his parents got two more boys, Issac and Lionel (better known as “Freddie”.) Nat was taught to play the piano at an early age by his mother. Perlina, determined to give her children a musical education, succeeded. Her four sons all became professional musicians. When Nat was 12 years old he regularly sung and played the organ in church. After he joined Wendell Phillips High School he was introduced to jazz music and was greatly enthusiastic about this new type of music: together with his brother Eddie he would explore the Chicago jazz scene whenever he could. In 1934 Nat organized a jazz quintet called “Nat Coles and his Royal Dukes”, as well as a 14-piece orchestra called “Rogues of Rhythm”. When Nat heard Earl Hines play one night, he was heavily impressed and driven to give his quintet a new, more rhythmic sound, much like Hines’. Later he’d say about Hines: \"It was his driving force that appealed to me ... I was just a kid and coming up, but I latched onto that new Hines style. Guess I still show the influence today.\" (-Down Beat, 1957). When Nat was 16 he joined Eddie’s band “Solid Swingers” and started performing at jazz joints throughout Chicago. It was in these joints that Nat gained his first bit of success. The (mere) success didn’t do much good to Nat’s educational career: he dropped out of High School in 1936. 1936 - 1940\nNot long after he turned 18, Nat married Nadine Robinson. They had met each other on the vaudeville “Shuffle Along”. Nadine was one of the show’s dancers, while Nat was a pianist in the vaudeville-orchestra. When the show ended the couple settled in Los Angeles. They didn’t have much money and in order to pay the rent Nat had to play the piano in local beer joints for little pay. After a year of hard work Cole’s talent was discovered by the owner of the famous Century Club, at that time the most popular hangout in L.A. for jazz musicians – Nat became a regular performer at this club. Around 1938 Nat was asked to form a quintet (that eventually became a trio as drummer Lee Young didn’t show up on the opening night.) After bassist Wesley Prince and guitarist Oscar Moore joined, the group performed at the Sewanee Inn, an L.A. nightclub. Owner of the nightclub, Bob Lewis, asked from Nat that he would carry a golden crown made of paper - this is how Nat got his nickname “King”. Nat soon got rid of the crown, but the band kept its name: the “King Cole Trio”. 1940 - 1950\nIn their early days, the King Cole Trio played instrumental jazz. After 1940 they gradually introduced vocals to their music**. December 1940 they had the opportunity to record for the Decca record company. They recorded the hit song “Sweet Lorraine” and the groups’ popularity increased dramatically. The King Cole Trio was a bit of an oddity in their days. The music scene was dominated by Big Bands and black musicians were rejected from popular clubs, racism still being very common in the early 1940s.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:2cb15f4a-7e7d-49a0-b6d8-bb71f013417f>"]},{"passage":"During the 1920s and 1930s, for example, a new simpler Art Deco style became popular in art, jewellery, graphic design, fashion and architecture, the aesthetics of which are more dictated by compositional design characteristic of straight lines rather than the flourishes and embellishments of the Art Nouveau period popular during the Ragtime Era. It was an era in which Jazz bands and their leaders took the stage wearing smart-looking tuxedos and suits and female singers donned au current fashions. Beginning with a trend in so-called “oriental numbers” describing the far-off lands that had perfectly suited the minor keys of early jazz; Jazz music would evolve into a carefully arranged and harmonised style of swing by 1935. By the end of the Jazz Era, Jazz music would transform from pop music phenomenon to the status of de facto American classical music and composers ranging from Duke Ellington to Thelonius Monk, Miles Davis to Charlie Parker are still renown for their compositions that transcend the relatively simple format of song. But not all music from the Jazz Era was explicitly jazzy. Traditional song styles of rural America like blues, country and folk music would get the commercial treatment and then transform to cultivated commercial pop song success. In the 1940s, there would be official charts measuring the nationwide popularity of songs; with R&B and Country charts documenting their respective commercial popularity by the end of the 1940s. While Jazz genre and styles associated with it are featured in the very name of the era, not everything released during this periods was about jazz. Old methods of music production and recording pioneered during the Ragtime Era would fall by the wayside throughout the Jazz Era as new technology developed for recording and delivering music to consumers and audiences. The old business model of Tin Pan Alley song plugging from the stage would fall out of favour by the 1930s, when the theatre business slumped during the Great Depression and particularly when radio broadcasting music and variety programmes flourished. Movies musicals coming from the studios of Los Angeles found a mass audience nearly as soon as movies featured sound in the late 1920s and songs found popularity after their inclusion in movies. During this time, music business celebrity would transfer from songwriter to popular recording star or band leaders. Arranged orchestras and their bandleaders would remain popular up until the mid 1940s, thereafter, a music industry awash in popular crooners took over the music market throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s. New record labels like Okeh, Capitol, Brunswick and Decca would come onto the market and challenge older established names like Victor and Columbia, some of these new labels releasing niche specialty music that would eventually find pop success. Record companies faced the changing realities of music broadcasting when radio and eventually television brought new music directly in the homes of Americans for free. But perhaps the greatest transformation of music industry during this era was the transformation from acoustic recording and playback to electronics. It was a time period in which new inventions like speakers, radio, microphones created a much higher fidelity music product than the acoustic methods of the phonograph. Throughout the Jazz Era, technological advancement continued to bring new products and recording techniques to the music market, but this advancement also brought changes in the music market when broadcasting began to delivery music directly into the home of potential music consumers. Just as interesting as it is to investigate the trends and changes in the music industry during the Jazz Era, it is also interesting to note who is recording the music and providing the product to consumers. Throughout the era, the home piano would become something of a relic and Americans would continue to opt for purchasing pre-recorded music rather than producing it themselves at home with sheet music. Obviously, the most associated musicians of the time were band leaders and the various orchestras of the jazz and swing periods. Also prominent throughout this period in relation to jazz proper was the “age of the Soloist”  in which talented instrumentalists and scat vocalists showed their skills by improvising on melodies, a staple of the early New Orleans Jazz scene going as far back as the 1890s.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e580519a-3e8b-42e9-8ae8-b97481ceabcf>"]},{"passage":"Evolution of American Popular Music from the 1950's to the 1990's\n(from Georgia Music School \"Evolution of Music from the 1950's to the 2000's\")\nMusic genres and styles have evolved over the decades, and many famous artists and bands have impacted it in so many ways. Without these talented musicians, music would not be what it is today. Here is a look at the most influential and groundbreaking artists, bands, and technology through the decades that all contributed to the creative path music has taken up until the present. This decade marked the creation of the rock’n’roll genre that is still popular today. One of the most popular, if not the most popular musician of the 1950's was Elvis Presley. Many know him as “the king of rock’n’roll,\" launching his career in 1954. He was adored by the young for his handsome looks, and his fantastic music could be heard in nearly every household in the 50's. During his career, he produced over 32 number one singles and 18 number one albums. The swinging-sixties brought many firsts, from the first music video to the significant advance of racial integration in music. Motown Record Corporation began its rise in the 60's. It was primarily owned by and featured African American Artists. Its first top ten hit was in 1960 for the song \"Shop Around\" by the Miracles. It peaked at number two of the Billboard Hot 100 and was Motown's very first million-selling record. All girl group, The Supremes released their album, \"The Supremes A Go-Go\" in 1966 and reached the number one spot on the Billboard Album Charts. Motown Records also produced this album. It was also in this century that Bob Dylan released the first music video for his single, \"Subterranean Homesick Blues.\" He led audiences away from the days of audio and into the music video, even if it was just a one-shot short. Other prominent artists of this time were The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. Both of these bands influenced and continued to influence the music world today. They will forever be recognized as some of the greatest artists and most legendary bands of all time. The 70’s were probably most famous for the leap into the rock era. Two of the most famous rock bands of the time were Aerosmith, officially formed in 1971 and KISS, officially formed in 1973. KISS is most well known for taking the rock sub-genre to a whole new level with overly creative wardrobes, face-paintings, and acts like blood spitting and fire breathing. The younger generation took a liking to this genre and related to the angst and aggression displayed in the band's song lyrics and performances. The 1980's probably had the biggest music revelation to date, the start of MTV, or music television. Making its debut in 1981, this channel was created to show music videos, and it was prevalent in society during this time. MTV's very first video featured The Buggles and their 1979 chart topping single \"Video Killed the Radio Star.\" Blondie's biggest hit, \"Call Me\" also peaked in the 80's. It held the number one spot for six weeks and was also certified gold for the one million copies it sold. Additionally, sub-genres like heavy metal, hard rock, and glam metal became extremely popular in this decade with artists like Guns n’ Roses and Bon Jovi. Hip-Hop also appeared on the scene with bands like Run-D.M.C who had a strong influence on the music industry. They were the first in their genre to reach gold record status and be nominated for a Grammy. There were several diverse music genres on the scene by the time the 90's rolled around. What was classified as \"grunge music\" and similar sub-genres peaked in popularity during the early 90's? For example, bands like Nirvana had huge success, and this unique style is still associated with the early 90's. Female pop icons, The Spice Girls, also rose to fame in the 90's in America and around the world. Their impact is most likely responsible for the invasion of all the teen pop acts that come in the coming decade, like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, ‘N Sync and the Backstreet Boys.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:44d420db-f6a6-4f9c-8d4f-ae3a3c99c75d>"]},{"passage":"Nat King Cole (100 Lyrics)\nNathaniel Adams Coles (March 17, 1919 \/ February 15, 1965), known professionally as Nat \"King\" Cole, was an American United States musician who first came to prominence as a leading jazz pianist.

Between 1920 and the mid 1950s, the orchestrated sounds of Jazz would take over the American commercial song market. Whether the light and breezy sounds of jazz bands during the 1920s and 1930s or the lush sounds of backing orchestras of the crooner years in the 1940s and early 1950s, this was an era marked by a certain style in both music and the celebrity achieved by success of recording artists in the music industry. This essay will explore the topics of the forthcoming Pop Song History essay series on the Jazz Era, including the various ways in which American social history, music trends, music technology and music industry collide to produce commercial success of titles, fads and trends of songs. Below are the sorts of subjects which will this blog will explore in detail in the forth coming series about the Jazz Era of Pop Song History. Throughout the Jazz Era, American cultural and social history seems inextricably linked to each decade and this series will explore the changes in American society in association with the kind of songs Americans were listening to and purchasing. The 1920s would be the embodiment of the Roaring Twenties Jazz Age, flapper girls, Jazz babies and the mindset of American rebellion against the laws of Prohibition. It would also be a politically conservative time following Progressive Era reforms including seemingly endless speculation into investments and the stock market and by a Red Scare that had been “simmering just beneath the skin of American tolerance” during the early 1920s. By the early 1930s, the economic and social lives of most Americans were turned upside down imparted by a catastrophic financial collapse of the Great Depression, continued economic stagnation and a decade of government attempts to rebuild the American economy from the ashes of financial tumult. Those in the Great Plains would face environmental difficulties on agricultural life in the Plains due to an oppressive drought and the resulting Dust Bowl years. The 1940s would see the United States engaged in another World War just over twenty years after concluding the First World War. Fears of Communism would be characteristic of this time with an Iron Curtain of Soviet sphere of influence sweeping over Eastern Europe and the American paranoia of a nuclear stalemate of the Cold War with the Soviet Union; both sides stockpiling nuclear weapons and engaging in espionage. During the 1950s, financial security for many American brought an era and prosperity on a mass scale and helped to create the sort of consumerism characteristic of the modern American economy. The new mass culture of America in the 1950s would also produce angst among many children of the Jazz Era who would eventually embrace a new style of Rock and Roll music. All throughout these decades, jazz music and style would reign supreme on the music market. The Jazz Era, from beginning to end, would be characterised by style, not just musically, but also in the fashions, art, and architecture of these decades.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e580519a-3e8b-42e9-8ae8-b97481ceabcf>"]},{"passage":"See more ideas about Jazz Beatnik Jazz\nHow bebop became big business in 1949 JAZZ.FM91 Bebop began to emerge in 1945 when Dizzy Gillespie recorded Be-Bop also known as Dizzy’s Fingers and Groovin’ High.

It was emulated by many musicians, among them Art Tatum, Erroll Garner, Oscar Peterson, Ahmad Jamal, Tommy Flanagan and blues pianists Charles Brown and Ray Charles. He also performed as a pianist on sessions with Lester Young, Red Callender, and Lionel Hampton. The Page Cavanaugh Trio with the same set up as Cole came out of the chute about the same time, at the end of the war. Cole's first mainstream vocal hit was his 1943 recording of one of his compositions, \"Straighten Up and Fly Right,\" based on a black folk tale that his father had used as a theme for a sermon. Johnny Mercer invited him to record it for the fledgling Capitol Records label. It sold over 500,000 copies, and proved that folk-based material could appeal to a wide audience. Although Nat would never be considered a rocker, the song can be seen as anticipating the first rock and roll records. Indeed, Bo Diddley, who performed similar transformations of folk material, counted Cole as an influence. Beginning in the late 1940's, Cole began recording and performing more pop-oriented material for mainstream audiences, often accompanied by a string orchestra. His stature as a popular icon was cemented during this period by hits such as \"The Christmas Song\" (Cole recorded the tune four times: June 14, 1946 as a pure Trio recording; August 19, 1946 with an added string section; August 24, 1953; and again in 1961 for the double album, The Nat King Cole Story. This final version, recorded in stereo, is the one most often heard today. ), \"Nature Boy\" (1948), \"Mona Lisa\" (1950), \"Too Young\" (the #1 song in 1951), and his signature tune \"Unforgettable\" (1951). While this shift to pop music led some jazz critics and fans to accuse Cole of selling out, he never totally abandoned his jazz roots; as late as 1956, for instance, he recorded an all-jazz album, After Midnight. [Harold Arlen - It's Only a Paper Moon]\nThe change in musical tastes during the late 1950s meant that Cole's ballad singing did not sell well with younger listeners, despite a successful stab at rock n' roll with \"Send For Me\" (peaked at #6 pop). Along with his contemporaries Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett, Cole found that the pop singles chart had been almost entirely taken over by youth-oriented acts. In 1960, Nat's long-time collaborator Nelson Riddle left Capitol Records for Frank Sinatra's newly formed Reprise Records label. Riddle and Cole recorded one final hit album Wild Is Love, based on lyrics by Ray Rasch and Dotty Wayne. Cole later retooled the concept album into an off-Broadway show, I'm With You. Cole, a heavy smoker who would smoke as much as three packets of cigarettes a day, died of lung cancer on February 15, 1965, while still at the height of his singing career. The day before he died, he did a radio interview, stating: \"I am feeling better than ever. I think I've finally got this cancer licked.\" [8919 Courage \/ 8919 Nat King Cole \/ 8918 Bernstein]","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:39a7065b-7e6d-4363-aedb-f6b019d59ff0>"]},{"passage":"1940s in jazz\nIn the early 1940s in jazz, bebop emerged, led by Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk and others. It helped to shift jazz from danceable popular music towards a more challenging \"musician's music.\" Differing greatly from swing, early bebop divorced itself from dance music, establishing itself more as an art form but lessening its potential popular and commercial value. Since bebop was meant to be listened to, not danced to, it used faster tempos. Beboppers introduced new forms of chromaticism and dissonance into jazz; the dissonant tritone (or \"flatted fifth\") interval became the \"most important interval of bebop\" and players engaged in a more abstracted form of chord-based improvisation which used \"passing\" chords, substitute chords, and altered chords. The style of drumming shifted as well to a more elusive and explosive style, in which the ride cymbal was used to keep time, while the snare and bass drum were used for accents. This appealed to a more specialized audiences than earlier forms of jazz, with sophisticated harmonies, fast tempos and often virtuoso musicianship. Bebop musicians often used 1930s standards, especially those from Broadway musicals, as part of their repertoire. Among standards written by bebop musicians are Gillespie's \"Salt Peanuts\" (1941) and \"A Night in Tunisia\" (1942), Parker's \"Anthropology\" (1946), \"Yardbird Suite\" (1946) and \"Scrapple from the Apple\" (1947), and Monk's \"'Round Midnight\" (1944), which is currently the most recorded jazz standard composed by a jazz musician. An early 1940s style known as \"jumping the blues\" or jump blues used small combos, uptempo music, and blues chord progressions. Jump blues drew on boogie-woogie from the 1930s. Kansas City Jazz in the 1930s as exemplified by tenor saxophonist Lester Young marked the transition from big bands to the bebop influence of the 1940s. These divergences from the jazz mainstream of the time initially met with a divided, sometimes hostile response among fans and fellow musicians, especially established swing players, who bristled at the new harmonic sounds. To hostile critics, bebop seemed to be filled with \"racing, nervous phrases\". Despite the initial friction, by the 1950s bebop had become an accepted part of the jazz vocabulary. The most influential bebop musicians included saxophonist Charlie Parker, pianists Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk, trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie and Clifford Brown, and drummer Max Roach. The swing era lasted until the mid-1940s, and produced popular tunes such as Duke Ellington's \"Cotton Tail\" (1940) and Billy Strayhorn's \"Take the 'A' Train\" (1941). When the big bands struggled to keep going during World War II, a shift was happening in jazz in favor of smaller groups. Some swing era musicians, like Louis Jordan, later found popularity in a new kind of music, called \"rhythm and blues\", that would evolve into rock and roll in the 1950s. In the late 1940s there was a revival of \"Dixieland\" music, harkening back to the original contrapuntal New Orleans style. This was driven in large part by record company reissues of early jazz classics by the Oliver, Morton, and Armstrong bands of the 1930s. There were two populations of musicians involved in the revival. One group consisted of players who had begun their careers playing in the traditional style, and were either returning to it, or continuing what they had been playing all along, such as Bob Crosby's Bobcats, Max Kaminsky, Eddie Condon, and Wild Bill Davison. Most of this group were originally Midwesterners, although there were a small number of New Orleans musicians involved. The second population of revivalists consisted of young musicians such as the Lu Watters band. By the late 1940s, Louis Armstrong's Allstars band became a leading ensemble. Through the 1950s and 1960s, Dixieland was one of the most commercially popular jazz styles in the US, Europe, and Japan, although critics paid little attention to it.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:f7ffb6af-5c48-4ad8-902e-4329f2a11116>"]},{"passage":"His father was a guitarist with a terrific liking for songs however worked as a crane operator so as to fend for his family.

The records he made in the 1940s have been of major influence on jazz\nmusic. His impact on generations of pianists\nwas not just far-reaching: it was fundamental. Nat is often regarded as the man who made it possible for black musicians to break through in the U.S. music scene. He did not refuse to perform before segregated audiences, for he believed that goodwill and exhibition of his talent were more effective than formal protests in fighting racism. His approach was not always a success: he was a victim of several racial incidents throughout his life. 1919 – 1936\nNathaniel Adams Coles was born on March 17 1919* in Montgomery, Alabama. He was born in a poor family: his father, Edward James Coles sr., was a reverend, his mother Perlina Adams Coles was the choir director of her husband’s church. Even though Nat’s parents had thirteen children, only five of them made it to adulthood. Nat grew up with his brother Edward jr. and his two sisters, Eddie Mae and Evelyn. When Nat was four years old his family moved to Chicago where his father had been offered pastorship of the True Light Baptist Church. In Chicago his parents got two more boys, Issac and Lionel (better known as “Freddie”.) Nat was taught to play the piano at an early age by his mother. Perlina, determined to give her children a musical education, succeeded. Her four sons all became professional musicians. When Nat was 12 years old he regularly sung and played the organ in church. After he joined Wendell Phillips High School he was introduced to jazz music and was greatly enthusiastic about this new type of music: together with his brother Eddie he would explore the Chicago jazz scene whenever he could. In 1934 Nat organized a jazz quintet called “Nat Coles and his Royal Dukes”, as well as a 14-piece orchestra called “Rogues of Rhythm”. When Nat heard Earl Hines play one night, he was heavily impressed and driven to give his quintet a new, more rhythmic sound, much like Hines’. Later he’d say about Hines: \"It was his driving force that appealed to me ... I was just a kid and coming up, but I latched onto that new Hines style. Guess I still show the influence today.\" (-Down Beat, 1957). When Nat was 16 he joined Eddie’s band “Solid Swingers” and started performing at jazz joints throughout Chicago. It was in these joints that Nat gained his first bit of success. The (mere) success didn’t do much good to Nat’s educational career: he dropped out of High School in 1936. 1936 - 1940\nNot long after he turned 18, Nat married Nadine Robinson. They had met each other on the vaudeville “Shuffle Along”. Nadine was one of the show’s dancers, while Nat was a pianist in the vaudeville-orchestra. When the show ended the couple settled in Los Angeles. They didn’t have much money and in order to pay the rent Nat had to play the piano in local beer joints for little pay. After a year of hard work Cole’s talent was discovered by the owner of the famous Century Club, at that time the most popular hangout in L.A. for jazz musicians – Nat became a regular performer at this club. Around 1938 Nat was asked to form a quintet (that eventually became a trio as drummer Lee Young didn’t show up on the opening night.) After bassist Wesley Prince and guitarist Oscar Moore joined, the group performed at the Sewanee Inn, an L.A. nightclub. Owner of the nightclub, Bob Lewis, asked from Nat that he would carry a golden crown made of paper - this is how Nat got his nickname “King”. Nat soon got rid of the crown, but the band kept its name: the “King Cole Trio”. 1940 - 1950\nIn their early days, the King Cole Trio played instrumental jazz. After 1940 they gradually introduced vocals to their music**. December 1940 they had the opportunity to record for the Decca record company. They recorded the hit song “Sweet Lorraine” and the groups’ popularity increased dramatically. The King Cole Trio was a bit of an oddity in their days. The music scene was dominated by Big Bands and black musicians were rejected from popular clubs, racism still being very common in the early 1940s.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, for example, a new simpler Art Deco style became popular in art, jewellery, graphic design, fashion and architecture, the aesthetics of which are more dictated by compositional design characteristic of straight lines rather than the flourishes and embellishments of the Art Nouveau period popular during the Ragtime Era. It was an era in which Jazz bands and their leaders took the stage wearing smart-looking tuxedos and suits and female singers donned au current fashions. Beginning with a trend in so-called “oriental numbers” describing the far-off lands that had perfectly suited the minor keys of early jazz; Jazz music would evolve into a carefully arranged and harmonised style of swing by 1935. By the end of the Jazz Era, Jazz music would transform from pop music phenomenon to the status of de facto American classical music and composers ranging from Duke Ellington to Thelonius Monk, Miles Davis to Charlie Parker are still renown for their compositions that transcend the relatively simple format of song. But not all music from the Jazz Era was explicitly jazzy. Traditional song styles of rural America like blues, country and folk music would get the commercial treatment and then transform to cultivated commercial pop song success. In the 1940s, there would be official charts measuring the nationwide popularity of songs; with R&B and Country charts documenting their respective commercial popularity by the end of the 1940s. While Jazz genre and styles associated with it are featured in the very name of the era, not everything released during this periods was about jazz. Old methods of music production and recording pioneered during the Ragtime Era would fall by the wayside throughout the Jazz Era as new technology developed for recording and delivering music to consumers and audiences. The old business model of Tin Pan Alley song plugging from the stage would fall out of favour by the 1930s, when the theatre business slumped during the Great Depression and particularly when radio broadcasting music and variety programmes flourished. Movies musicals coming from the studios of Los Angeles found a mass audience nearly as soon as movies featured sound in the late 1920s and songs found popularity after their inclusion in movies. During this time, music business celebrity would transfer from songwriter to popular recording star or band leaders. Arranged orchestras and their bandleaders would remain popular up until the mid 1940s, thereafter, a music industry awash in popular crooners took over the music market throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s. New record labels like Okeh, Capitol, Brunswick and Decca would come onto the market and challenge older established names like Victor and Columbia, some of these new labels releasing niche specialty music that would eventually find pop success. Record companies faced the changing realities of music broadcasting when radio and eventually television brought new music directly in the homes of Americans for free. But perhaps the greatest transformation of music industry during this era was the transformation from acoustic recording and playback to electronics. It was a time period in which new inventions like speakers, radio, microphones created a much higher fidelity music product than the acoustic methods of the phonograph. Throughout the Jazz Era, technological advancement continued to bring new products and recording techniques to the music market, but this advancement also brought changes in the music market when broadcasting began to delivery music directly into the home of potential music consumers. Just as interesting as it is to investigate the trends and changes in the music industry during the Jazz Era, it is also interesting to note who is recording the music and providing the product to consumers. Throughout the era, the home piano would become something of a relic and Americans would continue to opt for purchasing pre-recorded music rather than producing it themselves at home with sheet music. Obviously, the most associated musicians of the time were band leaders and the various orchestras of the jazz and swing periods. Also prominent throughout this period in relation to jazz proper was the “age of the Soloist”  in which talented instrumentalists and scat vocalists showed their skills by improvising on melodies, a staple of the early New Orleans Jazz scene going as far back as the 1890s.\n\nEvolution of American Popular Music from the 1950's to the 1990's\n(from Georgia Music School \"Evolution of Music from the 1950's to the 2000's\")\nMusic genres and styles have evolved over the decades, and many famous artists and bands have impacted it in so many ways. Without these talented musicians, music would not be what it is today. Here is a look at the most influential and groundbreaking artists, bands, and technology through the decades that all contributed to the creative path music has taken up until the present. This decade marked the creation of the rock’n’roll genre that is still popular today. One of the most popular, if not the most popular musician of the 1950's was Elvis Presley. Many know him as “the king of rock’n’roll,\" launching his career in 1954. He was adored by the young for his handsome looks, and his fantastic music could be heard in nearly every household in the 50's. During his career, he produced over 32 number one singles and 18 number one albums. The swinging-sixties brought many firsts, from the first music video to the significant advance of racial integration in music. Motown Record Corporation began its rise in the 60's. It was primarily owned by and featured African American Artists. Its first top ten hit was in 1960 for the song \"Shop Around\" by the Miracles. It peaked at number two of the Billboard Hot 100 and was Motown's very first million-selling record. All girl group, The Supremes released their album, \"The Supremes A Go-Go\" in 1966 and reached the number one spot on the Billboard Album Charts. Motown Records also produced this album. It was also in this century that Bob Dylan released the first music video for his single, \"Subterranean Homesick Blues.\" He led audiences away from the days of audio and into the music video, even if it was just a one-shot short. Other prominent artists of this time were The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. Both of these bands influenced and continued to influence the music world today. They will forever be recognized as some of the greatest artists and most legendary bands of all time. The 70’s were probably most famous for the leap into the rock era. Two of the most famous rock bands of the time were Aerosmith, officially formed in 1971 and KISS, officially formed in 1973. KISS is most well known for taking the rock sub-genre to a whole new level with overly creative wardrobes, face-paintings, and acts like blood spitting and fire breathing. The younger generation took a liking to this genre and related to the angst and aggression displayed in the band's song lyrics and performances. The 1980's probably had the biggest music revelation to date, the start of MTV, or music television. Making its debut in 1981, this channel was created to show music videos, and it was prevalent in society during this time. MTV's very first video featured The Buggles and their 1979 chart topping single \"Video Killed the Radio Star.\" Blondie's biggest hit, \"Call Me\" also peaked in the 80's. It held the number one spot for six weeks and was also certified gold for the one million copies it sold. Additionally, sub-genres like heavy metal, hard rock, and glam metal became extremely popular in this decade with artists like Guns n’ Roses and Bon Jovi. Hip-Hop also appeared on the scene with bands like Run-D.M.C who had a strong influence on the music industry. They were the first in their genre to reach gold record status and be nominated for a Grammy. There were several diverse music genres on the scene by the time the 90's rolled around. What was classified as \"grunge music\" and similar sub-genres peaked in popularity during the early 90's? For example, bands like Nirvana had huge success, and this unique style is still associated with the early 90's. Female pop icons, The Spice Girls, also rose to fame in the 90's in America and around the world. Their impact is most likely responsible for the invasion of all the teen pop acts that come in the coming decade, like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, ‘N Sync and the Backstreet Boys.\n\nNat King Cole (100 Lyrics)\nNathaniel Adams Coles (March 17, 1919 \/ February 15, 1965), known professionally as Nat \"King\" Cole, was an American United States musician who first came to prominence as a leading jazz pianist.

Between 1920 and the mid 1950s, the orchestrated sounds of Jazz would take over the American commercial song market. Whether the light and breezy sounds of jazz bands during the 1920s and 1930s or the lush sounds of backing orchestras of the crooner years in the 1940s and early 1950s, this was an era marked by a certain style in both music and the celebrity achieved by success of recording artists in the music industry. This essay will explore the topics of the forthcoming Pop Song History essay series on the Jazz Era, including the various ways in which American social history, music trends, music technology and music industry collide to produce commercial success of titles, fads and trends of songs. Below are the sorts of subjects which will this blog will explore in detail in the forth coming series about the Jazz Era of Pop Song History. Throughout the Jazz Era, American cultural and social history seems inextricably linked to each decade and this series will explore the changes in American society in association with the kind of songs Americans were listening to and purchasing. The 1920s would be the embodiment of the Roaring Twenties Jazz Age, flapper girls, Jazz babies and the mindset of American rebellion against the laws of Prohibition. It would also be a politically conservative time following Progressive Era reforms including seemingly endless speculation into investments and the stock market and by a Red Scare that had been “simmering just beneath the skin of American tolerance” during the early 1920s. By the early 1930s, the economic and social lives of most Americans were turned upside down imparted by a catastrophic financial collapse of the Great Depression, continued economic stagnation and a decade of government attempts to rebuild the American economy from the ashes of financial tumult. Those in the Great Plains would face environmental difficulties on agricultural life in the Plains due to an oppressive drought and the resulting Dust Bowl years. The 1940s would see the United States engaged in another World War just over twenty years after concluding the First World War. Fears of Communism would be characteristic of this time with an Iron Curtain of Soviet sphere of influence sweeping over Eastern Europe and the American paranoia of a nuclear stalemate of the Cold War with the Soviet Union; both sides stockpiling nuclear weapons and engaging in espionage. During the 1950s, financial security for many American brought an era and prosperity on a mass scale and helped to create the sort of consumerism characteristic of the modern American economy. The new mass culture of America in the 1950s would also produce angst among many children of the Jazz Era who would eventually embrace a new style of Rock and Roll music. All throughout these decades, jazz music and style would reign supreme on the music market. The Jazz Era, from beginning to end, would be characterised by style, not just musically, but also in the fashions, art, and architecture of these decades.\n\nSee more ideas about Jazz Beatnik Jazz\nHow bebop became big business in 1949 JAZZ.FM91 Bebop began to emerge in 1945 when Dizzy Gillespie recorded Be-Bop also known as Dizzy’s Fingers and Groovin’ High.

It was emulated by many musicians, among them Art Tatum, Erroll Garner, Oscar Peterson, Ahmad Jamal, Tommy Flanagan and blues pianists Charles Brown and Ray Charles. He also performed as a pianist on sessions with Lester Young, Red Callender, and Lionel Hampton. The Page Cavanaugh Trio with the same set up as Cole came out of the chute about the same time, at the end of the war. Cole's first mainstream vocal hit was his 1943 recording of one of his compositions, \"Straighten Up and Fly Right,\" based on a black folk tale that his father had used as a theme for a sermon. Johnny Mercer invited him to record it for the fledgling Capitol Records label. It sold over 500,000 copies, and proved that folk-based material could appeal to a wide audience. Although Nat would never be considered a rocker, the song can be seen as anticipating the first rock and roll records. Indeed, Bo Diddley, who performed similar transformations of folk material, counted Cole as an influence. Beginning in the late 1940's, Cole began recording and performing more pop-oriented material for mainstream audiences, often accompanied by a string orchestra. His stature as a popular icon was cemented during this period by hits such as \"The Christmas Song\" (Cole recorded the tune four times: June 14, 1946 as a pure Trio recording; August 19, 1946 with an added string section; August 24, 1953; and again in 1961 for the double album, The Nat King Cole Story. This final version, recorded in stereo, is the one most often heard today. ), \"Nature Boy\" (1948), \"Mona Lisa\" (1950), \"Too Young\" (the #1 song in 1951), and his signature tune \"Unforgettable\" (1951). While this shift to pop music led some jazz critics and fans to accuse Cole of selling out, he never totally abandoned his jazz roots; as late as 1956, for instance, he recorded an all-jazz album, After Midnight. [Harold Arlen - It's Only a Paper Moon]\nThe change in musical tastes during the late 1950s meant that Cole's ballad singing did not sell well with younger listeners, despite a successful stab at rock n' roll with \"Send For Me\" (peaked at #6 pop). Along with his contemporaries Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett, Cole found that the pop singles chart had been almost entirely taken over by youth-oriented acts. In 1960, Nat's long-time collaborator Nelson Riddle left Capitol Records for Frank Sinatra's newly formed Reprise Records label. Riddle and Cole recorded one final hit album Wild Is Love, based on lyrics by Ray Rasch and Dotty Wayne. Cole later retooled the concept album into an off-Broadway show, I'm With You. Cole, a heavy smoker who would smoke as much as three packets of cigarettes a day, died of lung cancer on February 15, 1965, while still at the height of his singing career. The day before he died, he did a radio interview, stating: \"I am feeling better than ever. I think I've finally got this cancer licked.\" [8919 Courage \/ 8919 Nat King Cole \/ 8918 Bernstein]\n\n1940s in jazz\nIn the early 1940s in jazz, bebop emerged, led by Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk and others. It helped to shift jazz from danceable popular music towards a more challenging \"musician's music.\" Differing greatly from swing, early bebop divorced itself from dance music, establishing itself more as an art form but lessening its potential popular and commercial value. Since bebop was meant to be listened to, not danced to, it used faster tempos. Beboppers introduced new forms of chromaticism and dissonance into jazz; the dissonant tritone (or \"flatted fifth\") interval became the \"most important interval of bebop\" and players engaged in a more abstracted form of chord-based improvisation which used \"passing\" chords, substitute chords, and altered chords. The style of drumming shifted as well to a more elusive and explosive style, in which the ride cymbal was used to keep time, while the snare and bass drum were used for accents. This appealed to a more specialized audiences than earlier forms of jazz, with sophisticated harmonies, fast tempos and often virtuoso musicianship. Bebop musicians often used 1930s standards, especially those from Broadway musicals, as part of their repertoire. Among standards written by bebop musicians are Gillespie's \"Salt Peanuts\" (1941) and \"A Night in Tunisia\" (1942), Parker's \"Anthropology\" (1946), \"Yardbird Suite\" (1946) and \"Scrapple from the Apple\" (1947), and Monk's \"'Round Midnight\" (1944), which is currently the most recorded jazz standard composed by a jazz musician. An early 1940s style known as \"jumping the blues\" or jump blues used small combos, uptempo music, and blues chord progressions. Jump blues drew on boogie-woogie from the 1930s. Kansas City Jazz in the 1930s as exemplified by tenor saxophonist Lester Young marked the transition from big bands to the bebop influence of the 1940s. These divergences from the jazz mainstream of the time initially met with a divided, sometimes hostile response among fans and fellow musicians, especially established swing players, who bristled at the new harmonic sounds. To hostile critics, bebop seemed to be filled with \"racing, nervous phrases\". Despite the initial friction, by the 1950s bebop had become an accepted part of the jazz vocabulary. The most influential bebop musicians included saxophonist Charlie Parker, pianists Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk, trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie and Clifford Brown, and drummer Max Roach. The swing era lasted until the mid-1940s, and produced popular tunes such as Duke Ellington's \"Cotton Tail\" (1940) and Billy Strayhorn's \"Take the 'A' Train\" (1941). When the big bands struggled to keep going during World War II, a shift was happening in jazz in favor of smaller groups. Some swing era musicians, like Louis Jordan, later found popularity in a new kind of music, called \"rhythm and blues\", that would evolve into rock and roll in the 1950s. In the late 1940s there was a revival of \"Dixieland\" music, harkening back to the original contrapuntal New Orleans style. This was driven in large part by record company reissues of early jazz classics by the Oliver, Morton, and Armstrong bands of the 1930s. There were two populations of musicians involved in the revival. One group consisted of players who had begun their careers playing in the traditional style, and were either returning to it, or continuing what they had been playing all along, such as Bob Crosby's Bobcats, Max Kaminsky, Eddie Condon, and Wild Bill Davison. Most of this group were originally Midwesterners, although there were a small number of New Orleans musicians involved. The second population of revivalists consisted of young musicians such as the Lu Watters band. By the late 1940s, Louis Armstrong's Allstars band became a leading ensemble. Through the 1950s and 1960s, Dixieland was one of the most commercially popular jazz styles in the US, Europe, and Japan, although critics paid little attention to it.\n\nHis father was a guitarist with a terrific liking for songs however worked as a crane operator so as to fend for his family.

Cole began the decade as a prominent jazz pianist, but he gradually expanded his repertoire to include pop music, which led to him becoming one of the most successful and influential artists of the era.\n\nIn the early 1940s, Cole was known primarily for his jazz performances with the King Cole Trio, which consisted of himself on piano, Wesley Prince on bass, and Oscar Moore on guitar. The trio was known for playing instrumental jazz and was quite popular in nightclubs. Cole's jazz career was well-established, and he had already made a name for himself in the jazz world.\n\nHowever, Cole's career took a major turn in 1943 when he began to include vocals in his performances. His first hit as a vocalist was \"Straighten Up and Fly Right,\" a song based on a black folk tale. This marked the beginning of his transition from jazz to pop music, which would become his primary focus for the remainder of the decade.\n\nCole's crossover to pop music was solidified in 1946 when he recorded \"The Christmas Song\" (also known as \"Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire\"), which became a holiday classic and helped to cement his status as a pop singer. Other hit songs from this period included \"Nature Boy\" (1948), \"Mona Lisa\" (1950), \"Too Young\" (the #1 song in 1951), and his signature tune \"Unforgettable\" (1951).\n\nCole's success in the pop charts was significant, and he became one of the most popular singers of the 1940s and 1950s. His smooth, mellow voice and sophisticated style appealed to a wide audience, and he was able to bridge the gap between jazz and pop music.\n\nDespite the success of his pop career, Cole never completely abandoned his jazz roots. He continued to perform and record jazz throughout his career, demonstrating his versatility as a musician.\n\nIn summary, Nat King Cole's musical career in the 1940s evolved from being a jazz pianist to a successful pop singer, while still maintaining his jazz credentials. His ability to cross over from jazz to pop music made him a pivotal figure in the development of American music during this era.","id":1}
