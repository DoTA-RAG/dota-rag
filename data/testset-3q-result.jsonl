These pieces are considered the most involving works of art, with larger Unikat items requiring several hours of very careful work to complete.","answer":"A Polish pottery piece marked as a Unikat (Signature) item is distinguished by its unique, handcrafted nature. These pieces are individually hand painted using both sponges and brushes by the artist who created them. This meticulous process makes each Unikat piece truly unique, as no two will be exactly alike. Unikat pieces are considered the most intricate works of art within the Polish pottery collection due to the level of detail and personal touch involved in their creation.\n\nIn contrast, regular Polish pottery pieces are often produced using more standardized methods, such as stencils and molds, which can result in a greater degree of uniformity among items within a specific pattern or design. While these pieces are also hand painted, the level of individual variation and personal artistic expression found in Unikat items is generally not present in standard pottery.\n\nLarger Unikat items, in particular, require a significant amount of time and careful work to complete, adding to their value and uniqueness as they become a one-of-a-kind piece of art rather than a mass-produced item.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: This Polish pottery Bowl\nis made by Ceramika Artystyczna\nworkshop in Boleslawiec, Poland.

While living in Europe for many years, Beach visited Poland in 1993 and became a collector of the brightly colored and patterned pieces. She began sending gifts home to her mother and sister-in-law, and after they fell in love as well, she began to wonder if there might be a market for Polish pottery. When she returned home to Florida in 1999, the Polish Pottery business was born. 100 DIFFERENT PATTERNS AND MORE THAN 200 UNIQUE SHAPES. The warehouse itself is a hidden gem, located in an industrial area along Wickham Road at 3185 New York Avenue #13, in Melbourne. But walking through the doors into the 4,000 square feet of retail space filled with color and pattern is an amazing experience. “I’ve heard it’s an adventure coming into the store. It can be a little overwhelming the first time you come in, with so many choices. I suggest taking a stroll through the entire store to get a better idea of what’s available.”\nBeach is happy to walk customers through the offerings and is a wealth of information about the history, artistry and utilitarianism of Polish pottery. “One great feature of Polish pottery is you can create your own unique collection by mixing and matching patterns, and the more you get, the easier it is to add another.”Each piece is hand painted in Poland, and the high firing temperatures create durable, utilitarian stoneware covered in intricate, beautiful decorations. All Polish pottery is oven, microwave and dishwasher safe, making it perfectly suited for everyday use. “It’s essentially functional art,” Beach said. “Some pieces are labeled UNIKAT, meaning ‘unique’ in Polish. Collectors are sure to find some unique pieces to add to their collection.”But for Beach, the things that make certain pieces special are the holiday and family memories wrapped up in her collection. “I have so many traditional pieces I’ve had in my house forever — casseroles and plates I served Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners on year after year.

My love for Polish pottery began with my own collection, which grew until I replaced most of my tableware with it. After receiving many compliments and buying a lot of pieces as gifts for friends and family, I decided to spread my love for Polish pottery and Groshek Pottery was born. Groshek (or groszek) means \"polka dot\" in Polish, which reflects the many beautiful spotty designs that Polish pottery is renowned for. What is Polish pottery? Every piece of Polish pottery is handmade and hand-decorated using stamps and brushes. It comes in hundreds of shapes, with patterns ranging from classic dots and “peacock eyes” to more intricate “artistic” or “UNIKAT” patterns. My pottery comes from Zaklady Ceramiczne “Boleslawiec”, which is one of the biggest manufacturers in the region and whose tradition goes back to the 19th century. Caring for your pottery\nThe high quality of the clay combined with the manufacturing process make Polish pottery extremely durable. Fired at over 1200°C, it is classed as stoneware and safe to use in dishwashers, microwaves and fridges. This makes Polish pottery suitable for everyday use at home and in catering. All dishes with a grooved bottom are also safe to use in traditional gas or electric ovens up to 280°C, as well as on glass, ceramic and electric hobs.\n\nWhat is Polish Pottery? In simple terms, it is functional art. Broken down in more simple terms, it is a product made from a dense white clay, twice glazed and fired at extremely high temperatures. The region where this comes from used to be part of Germany but is now Boleslawiec, Poland. The clay is the secret here. It is beautifully “white” allowing for various colors to stand out. This makes for the perfect artist pallet and Boleslawiec is a region known for it’s artists. The clay is dense. It does make it heavier but the product is superior. As long as you follow a few simple rules, it will last longer than any of us will. It does not chip like cheaper, lighter stoneware that is more porous. The double glaze allows for a scratch resistant surface that is lead and cadmium free. POLISH POTTERY IT IS 100% SAFE TO USE. IT IS OVEN SAFE, MICROWAVE SAFE, DISHWASHER SAFE AND FREEZER SAFE. In fact I have even cooked an entire dinner in this stoneware using only my grill. I’ll go into depth later about the patterns of polish pottery but for now it’s only important that you know that every single piece is done by hand. The pieces are cast from molds but the painting is unique. There is no mass production in the creation of this product. Orders take 6-9 months to complete. There are different levels of artistry (again, I’ll expand on that in another article) which will affect the price. You’ll notice that 95% of my pictures are taken using Polish pottery. That’s because it is the primary serving and cooking tools in my kitchen. Where can you buy Polish Pottery? Pacific Polish Pottery is the best place. Family owned since 2000, they know everything there is to know. They offer free shipping on orders over $99.00 and they are always listing new pieces. Same day shipping in many cases, reward points and friendly customer service are just a few reasons to visit their store.\n\nSo what is Polish Pottery anyway? Polish pottery has been popping up all over the United States in recent years. It’s been featured in magazines like Better Homes and Gardens. You can find pieces in stores and online. But if you’ve never seen it before, you might be wondering just what exactly is so great about it. So here are 5 great reasons to check out polish pottery for yourself. 1) Polish Pottery is handmade. Polish Pottery is made by hand out of white clay found in Boleslawiec, Poland. The patterns are all hand stamped and\/or hand designed by local artists. This means that each piece is slightly different, which adds to the charm of the pottery. 2) There’s something for everyone. There are hundreds of patterns available in Polish Pottery. Everything from the traditional peacock eye pattern, to beautiful flower patterns. There are seasonal patterns too! Snowmen for Christmas, stars and stripes for 4th of July…you name it and they make it. 3) Durability. I use my Polish Pottery every day and it still looks beautiful. It’s microwave safe, oven safe, and dishwasher safe. It doesn’t chip easily, and it evenly distributes heat to your food. 4) The endless ability to mix and match. Remember those hundreds of patterns we talked about earlier, well you can mix and match them to your heart’s content. Many of the pieces feature similar colors, so they look great together on your table.

You might notice the dry, rough, cracking bark of a tree, and beneath is the smooth, fresh, unblemished surface. I’m moved by these sensual contrasts. I admire the way you do not overwork a piece to the point where people have to guess or be surprised at what the object is all about, other than the obvious, that it is some sort of vessel. do people tend to see right away a sense of either super primitive, or ultra modern? Paula: I think people realize that my pots contain both a sense of primitive and modern design. they see the ancient and traditional techniques but in new, innovative ways. I leave evidence of the way the piece was constructed. I find beauty in seams and joints. overworking a pot may lead towards a seamless perfection, but it can diminish the sense of fresh energy. I want my work to express the constant fluidity of life that honors material and process. the Japanese term “wabi sabi” describes this aesthetic. It is a way of living that finds beauty in imperfection. What kind of clay do you favor using, and why? Paula: I use a low-fire clay from Sheffield Pottery called Mass White. It has terrific strength at my very low firing temperature. I do a preliminary (bisque) firing in my electric kiln, transforming the clay to a white color. In the smoke firing, “naked” Mass White absorbs less carbon than the areas with the polished slip. the bare clay turns a lovely gray that contrasts nicely with the intense black of the polished slip surface. Paula, tell me more about your firing process. Paula: outside I have small kiln I built from house bricks. I fill this with a mix of hardwood shavings and my pots. I add a bit of newspaper and light it. Within a few minutes, the shavings are burning and I cover the kiln. It burns for about 24 hours. Smoke firing is very unpredictable. on a windy or rainy day the pots can have a very dynamic and smokey look to their surface. over the last few years, I have been working with either texture or line drawings on my work, and do not want the atmospheric, smokey look to detract from the form and surface design. So I had to come up with a way to achieve a more uniform black\/gray surface. to do this, each piece is wrapped individually in a single sheet of newspaper, then in foil, and then placed in the kiln. As the paper burns, the smoke is trapped against the pot by this foil saggar. the results are a very even black\/gray. What do you have in your studio that, say, painters do not have? Paula: In addition to my electric kiln for bisque firing, one of my most frequently used tools is a large rolling pin for rolling out slabs of clay. And of course, I have hundreds of “found tools” for creating various textures. My favorite textures are created from both common and uncommon items: a serrated steak knife, a non-slip\nrug mat, an oversized wooden bead from Africa, and the end of a bamboo paint brush. I also have boxes and boxes filled with objects that I have collected from nature: coral, seed pods, sea grass, tiny animal bones... I use these for impressions in the soft clay and for inspiration. I’ve always loved the glazing process, but your unique surface comes from the use of terra sigillata (polished slip). fascinating! Tell me more! Paula: Yes, I make the terra sigillata myself. It is basically the finest particles of clay separated out from the coarser ones. It is a very refined clay slip that has the consistency of skim milk. I paint multiple coats over the surface of my pot before it is fired. this is done at the bone-dry stage, when the pots are very fragile. At just the right moment, when the terra sigilatta has lost its wet look but still remains moist, I polish the entire surface.\n\nQuestion:What makes a Polish pottery piece a Unikat (Signature) item and how is it different from regular pieces?","passages":[{"passage":"This Polish pottery Bowl\nis made by Ceramika Artystyczna\nworkshop in Boleslawiec, Poland.

You might notice the dry, rough, cracking bark of a tree, and beneath is the smooth, fresh, unblemished surface. I’m moved by these sensual contrasts. I admire the way you do not overwork a piece to the point where people have to guess or be surprised at what the object is all about, other than the obvious, that it is some sort of vessel. do people tend to see right away a sense of either super primitive, or ultra modern? Paula: I think people realize that my pots contain both a sense of primitive and modern design. they see the ancient and traditional techniques but in new, innovative ways. I leave evidence of the way the piece was constructed. I find beauty in seams and joints. overworking a pot may lead towards a seamless perfection, but it can diminish the sense of fresh energy. I want my work to express the constant fluidity of life that honors material and process. the Japanese term “wabi sabi” describes this aesthetic. It is a way of living that finds beauty in imperfection. What kind of clay do you favor using, and why? Paula: I use a low-fire clay from Sheffield Pottery called Mass White. It has terrific strength at my very low firing temperature. I do a preliminary (bisque) firing in my electric kiln, transforming the clay to a white color. In the smoke firing, “naked” Mass White absorbs less carbon than the areas with the polished slip. the bare clay turns a lovely gray that contrasts nicely with the intense black of the polished slip surface. Paula, tell me more about your firing process. Paula: outside I have small kiln I built from house bricks. I fill this with a mix of hardwood shavings and my pots. I add a bit of newspaper and light it. Within a few minutes, the shavings are burning and I cover the kiln. It burns for about 24 hours. Smoke firing is very unpredictable. on a windy or rainy day the pots can have a very dynamic and smokey look to their surface. over the last few years, I have been working with either texture or line drawings on my work, and do not want the atmospheric, smokey look to detract from the form and surface design. So I had to come up with a way to achieve a more uniform black\/gray surface. to do this, each piece is wrapped individually in a single sheet of newspaper, then in foil, and then placed in the kiln. As the paper burns, the smoke is trapped against the pot by this foil saggar. the results are a very even black\/gray. What do you have in your studio that, say, painters do not have? Paula: In addition to my electric kiln for bisque firing, one of my most frequently used tools is a large rolling pin for rolling out slabs of clay. And of course, I have hundreds of “found tools” for creating various textures. My favorite textures are created from both common and uncommon items: a serrated steak knife, a non-slip\nrug mat, an oversized wooden bead from Africa, and the end of a bamboo paint brush. I also have boxes and boxes filled with objects that I have collected from nature: coral, seed pods, sea grass, tiny animal bones... I use these for impressions in the soft clay and for inspiration. I’ve always loved the glazing process, but your unique surface comes from the use of terra sigillata (polished slip). fascinating! Tell me more! Paula: Yes, I make the terra sigillata myself. It is basically the finest particles of clay separated out from the coarser ones. It is a very refined clay slip that has the consistency of skim milk. I paint multiple coats over the surface of my pot before it is fired. this is done at the bone-dry stage, when the pots are very fragile. At just the right moment, when the terra sigilatta has lost its wet look but still remains moist, I polish the entire surface.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:d21d8b3a-f59e-4595-83d5-d12cdf6abe8a>"]}]}

I’ve been fascinated by viewing the United States through his eyes from photos taken decades ago and now have enjoyed the journey of finding the same locations to see for myself. I hope you come back and check out the progression of the Vintage America project every Friday! Work began on the Crazy Horse Memorial in 1948 and, once completed, it will be the largest sculpture in the world. In the foreground is a model of what the planned Memorial will eventually look like…so while I was amazed at the detail of the face of Crazy Horse, I was also shocked at really how much of the sculpture had yet to be completed. Since the time of my grandfather’s photograph, Crazy Horse has also gained popularity as a must-see tourist attraction, hence the extended observation deck and Visitor Center addition behind the model statue. As I was waiting for the optimal time to capture the same image my grandfather had, it was particularly satisfying to have conversations with people regarding my project and see their excitement about it. One older woman even asked to take a picture of me holding my grandfather’s photo! All throughout my trip I came across people who were genuinely excited about my mission, which further confirmed that the venture I’m undertaking is a worthwhile endeavor. I hope that all of you feel the same and that you’ll continue to follow and support the project!

In the visitors centre they had an exhibition on the sculptor and the creation.It truly was a fantastic place to see! I feel so lucky that we got to see it too! We drove the short distance from Mount Rushmore to Crazy Horse Memorial, which is a bit different as it’s a memorial not yet completed. The Crazy Horse Memorial, is a tribute to the Lakota leader, Crazy Horse. He was a warrior and an instrumental part in the battle of Little Bighorn. He was killed in 1877 in Nebraska. He was only in his thirties. On September 6th every year, a night last at the memorial is held to honour Crazy Horse’s short but legendary life as well as the birth of the sculptor, Korczak Ziolkowski. Ziolkowski was invited by Lakota Chief Henry Standing Beat to carve the sculpture of Crazy Horse. It stands to honour the culture and heritage of all North American Indians. Ziolkowski was unsure to begin with as he didn’t think Crazy Horse had necessarily done anything to perhaps warrant a memoria but it turns out it was to be more of a memorial to his spirit. His left hand would be pointed forward because he was asked by a white man once, “Where are your lands now?” Crazy Horse replied, “My lands are where my dead lie buried.” The Native Indians, had their own customs and way of living which was taken away from them after the battle of Little Bighorn. Ziolkowski maintened the idea that the memorial and foundation should be solely privately funded and nothing taken from the government. To this day it remains privately funded from tourists flocking to the visitors centre and surrounding areas. It also remained a family affair with Ziolkowski’s wife Ruth and ten children either working in the mountain , serving in the board or running the gift shop and visitors centre. They showed a video about this which was really quite moving! Ruth passed in 2014 but the children continue to work there!From here it was on to Jewel Cave National Monument. There is so much to see and do in South Dakota! Our passes didn’t get us entry on to the tour here but that didn’t matter as we were excited to see another cave. Jewel Cave isn’t as long as Mammoth Cave and comes in at 189 miles and still exploring! Everywhere we have visited so far today sits in the Black Hills region of South Dakota. Jewel cave was established as a national monument in 1908. Ranger Gregory asked “who by?” To which I replied Roosevelt, citing that it was the President, Theodore Roosevelt who designated it. I then got called a brown nose for the trip because I answered the “rhetorical question.” Or I have just paid attention to everywhere we have been…😂\nWe descended an elevator (yes an elevator in an old cave) to 240ft below the surface.The cave only had a mile explored when it became a national monument in 1908 and it wasn’t until the 1960s when Herb and Jan Conn spent 21 years leading caving trips and mapping 65 miles of the cave. Since then it has been explored to 189 miles with no sign of stopping! The map of the cave shows different levels depending on colour and each room and place that has been uncovered has been named. It’s a first come first name basis so whoever finds it, names it. There are some interesting names such as, the ‘big duh’ for the biggest room in the cave so far, ‘the good the bad and the ugly,’ ‘no way through,’ amongst others. The whole bits in the photo are calcite crystal.Huge flowstone above\nJewel cave is named for its jewel-like calcite crystals surrounding the passageways. The cave consists of stalactites, soda straws (not to be drunk from), flowstone and pillars.

There are guidelines to use the Drone more than like 2Km , 5Km range as we used small drones for capturing pictures from around 200m ..400m so you can use with the normal permissions. Yes Local police or forest dept for some trek . Normal permission means the local police or the local tourism incharge? The one with higher frequency radius sure needs permission which is quite impossible to get. Drones are specifically not allowed in touristy places, try shooting gorilla and don’t get caught if you really need some drone shots.

Rushmore, and I recall being non-plussed. Mountains are beautiful just as nature has sculpted them. It struck me as presumptuous in the midst of such scenery to carve faces of four dead presidents on the side of one. I declined to stop and pay to see Mt. Rushmore this trip, but was very glad I visited Crazy Horse. Eventually the grounds are to be home to a medical center and a university for Native Americans from throughout North America. Although the family and the memorial’s foundation could have raised funds by selling stone blasted from the mountain to be turned into gravel, they are keeping it all on site, where it will eventually be used in building those facilities. The visitor center is still a fair distance from the mountain itself. But you can hop on a school bus that takes you to the base of the mountain, and well worth the $4. These bus tours run about every 15 minutes during the summer and last about 25 minutes. You get to see the mountain from the far side of the visitor complex, then can disembark at the midpoint of the mountain. I thought I’d learned a lot from the orientation film, but our bus driver shared many more fascinating details. He’d clearly worked there a long time, knew the family, and cared about the mission of the place. The size of this thing is hard to grasp (all four presidents on Mt. Rushmore collectively are smaller than the face of Crazy Horse, if I recall what my bus guide said correctly). Here are photos from the base of the mountain I shot thanks to that bus ride. I had one more \"must-see\" on my list before heading to Rapid City for dinner: Iron Mountain Road. The 17-mile drive from Crazy Horse to Mt. Rushmore is so scenic and lush with trees, I didn’t mind the several stops I encountered for road construction and one-way traffic. I was surprised at what a close view I had of the dead presidents from Hwy. 244 as I drove past the entrance to Mt. Rushmore. But I would see them again – several times – after I turned south on 16A, that portion of which is known as Iron Mountain Road, part of the Peter Norbeck National Scenic Byway. Norbeck was a South Dakota governor, U.S. senator, and conservationist whose name I’d seen repeatedly. Among the projects he championed for his native state of South Dakota were Mt. Rushmore and Iron Mountain Road, which features several more of those one-lane tunnels – these designed to perfectly frame views of Mt. Rushmore. At the top of Iron Mountain Road is a scenic pull-off where you can see Mt. Rushmore like this. It was disjarring to go from that kind of landscape to my motel in Rapid City on I-90. But I had a dinner reservation at The Corn Exchange, which I'd read somewhere was the best restaurant in South Dakota. This Western-casual-meets-fine-dining storefront in downtown Rapid City did not disappoint. My appetizer was this corn and scallion buttermilk pancake topped with house-smoked Black Hills trout, a cucumber-horseradish raita made with Cowgirl Creamery creme fraiche, and these spectacular eggs. For my entree, I went with a house specialty, the Corn Exchange steak, made that night with bison from local source 777 Buffalo Ranch. After such a great meal, I couldn't resist dessert, this lovely chocolate pot de creme with raspberries. A satisfying conclusion to a very memorable day. xoxo to all, and especially to my dad,\n\nQuestion:Can I use a drone to take pictures of Crazy Horse Memorial?","passages":[{"passage":"The collection of my grandfather’s photographs that I’ve had the chance to replicate continues this week with a shot of the Crazy Horse Memorial in South Dakota.

Rushmore, and I recall being non-plussed. Mountains are beautiful just as nature has sculpted them. It struck me as presumptuous in the midst of such scenery to carve faces of four dead presidents on the side of one. I declined to stop and pay to see Mt. Rushmore this trip, but was very glad I visited Crazy Horse. Eventually the grounds are to be home to a medical center and a university for Native Americans from throughout North America. Although the family and the memorial’s foundation could have raised funds by selling stone blasted from the mountain to be turned into gravel, they are keeping it all on site, where it will eventually be used in building those facilities. The visitor center is still a fair distance from the mountain itself. But you can hop on a school bus that takes you to the base of the mountain, and well worth the $4. These bus tours run about every 15 minutes during the summer and last about 25 minutes. You get to see the mountain from the far side of the visitor complex, then can disembark at the midpoint of the mountain. I thought I’d learned a lot from the orientation film, but our bus driver shared many more fascinating details. He’d clearly worked there a long time, knew the family, and cared about the mission of the place. The size of this thing is hard to grasp (all four presidents on Mt. Rushmore collectively are smaller than the face of Crazy Horse, if I recall what my bus guide said correctly). Here are photos from the base of the mountain I shot thanks to that bus ride. I had one more \"must-see\" on my list before heading to Rapid City for dinner: Iron Mountain Road. The 17-mile drive from Crazy Horse to Mt. Rushmore is so scenic and lush with trees, I didn’t mind the several stops I encountered for road construction and one-way traffic. I was surprised at what a close view I had of the dead presidents from Hwy. 244 as I drove past the entrance to Mt. Rushmore. But I would see them again – several times – after I turned south on 16A, that portion of which is known as Iron Mountain Road, part of the Peter Norbeck National Scenic Byway. Norbeck was a South Dakota governor, U.S. senator, and conservationist whose name I’d seen repeatedly. Among the projects he championed for his native state of South Dakota were Mt. Rushmore and Iron Mountain Road, which features several more of those one-lane tunnels – these designed to perfectly frame views of Mt. Rushmore. At the top of Iron Mountain Road is a scenic pull-off where you can see Mt. Rushmore like this. It was disjarring to go from that kind of landscape to my motel in Rapid City on I-90. But I had a dinner reservation at The Corn Exchange, which I'd read somewhere was the best restaurant in South Dakota. This Western-casual-meets-fine-dining storefront in downtown Rapid City did not disappoint. My appetizer was this corn and scallion buttermilk pancake topped with house-smoked Black Hills trout, a cucumber-horseradish raita made with Cowgirl Creamery creme fraiche, and these spectacular eggs. For my entree, I went with a house specialty, the Corn Exchange steak, made that night with bison from local source 777 Buffalo Ranch. After such a great meal, I couldn't resist dessert, this lovely chocolate pot de creme with raspberries.

In other words, have the right parts at the right place at the right time. Assuring supply can easily be achieved by stocking the shelves with every imaginable spare part in such enormous quantities that almost any combination of required materials is in stock at any given time. This will surely satisfy service objectives, but is this the best approach? Unfortunately, nothing in life is free. Materials cost money and take up plenty of space, and very few materials managers have access to unlimited funds. Finance and plant management are responsible for making sure that purchasing budgets are monitored and controlled, and inventory investment levels are optimized. Uncontrolled spending leads to bloated inventory, which in turn often results in mandated investment reductions. But managing inventory is not as easy as just setting the objective and then expecting it to happen all by itself. Nor is it simply a matter of cutting off funding or randomly eliminating parts from the storeroom. These may have the desired effect on investment, but what about service and, more importantly, the potential impact in terms of lost production? This leaves materials management in the difficult predicament of having to concurrently maintain adequate levels of material supply while also prudently managing the company's resources. Some would consider these conflicting goals resulting in a dilemma - a situation that requires choosing between two different alternatives. But, is it? To effectively support maintenance and production, it is critical to have the required parts available when needed. Finance and plant management will generally support the purchase of materials necessary to keep plant equipment running in order to maintain production levels. However, \"available\" doesn't have to mean \"on the shelf,\" and \"when needed\" doesn't necessarily imply \"right away.\" There is a point at which both service and investment are optimized so that they become mutually achievable objectives. Having said that, it isn't a simple task to accomplish, and as with any significant challenge, the best way to begin is to understand the problem and develop a plan of attack. Effective inventory management requires an understanding of the fundamental material management principles, data and work processes that impact material supply and contribute to the total cost of the MRO operation. It also involves the establishment of realistic and measurable goals, along with disciplined approaches for achieving them. Most importantly, it requires a commitment of time from knowledgeable individuals to make informed, intelligent and often difficult decisions. The blueprint for success is Integrated Inventory Management. This methodology provides a vehicle that helps arrive at the right decisions about what to buy, when to buy it, what to keep in stock and what to eliminate. It provides a disciplined process that effectively controls storeroom investment and associated inventory costs while maintaining an acceptable level of service. This article provides an overview of the basic elements of Integrated Inventory Management and key linkages. Subsequent articles to be published on the Reliable Plant Web site (www.reliableplant.com) will provide additional details that further explain each of the specific activities involved. Figure 1. An illustration of the Integrated Inventory Management Model.Integrated Inventory Management Model\nIn the model, the blue-shaded figures represent stand-alone inventory management processes. In subsequent articles, each of these will be discussed in detail, providing background information, a fundamental understanding of the process, some guidelines for implementation and some helpful hints to maximize their effectiveness. The green-colored figures represent input\/output data, reports or other electronic documents developed and\/or used throughout each step to support the overall process. In most cases, these will be addressed within the subject matter of the appropriate work process where they are used or produced. In other cases, it will be necessary to address them separately. Together, the work processes and associated information form a logical sequence of activities that build on one another. The overall Integrated Inventory Management model begins with a foundation that is focused on basic data integrity. From there, the concentration is on practical application of work processes that rely on this data to establish a baseline for improvement. The next step is to develop realistic goals and action plans that will help control inventory and achieve those goals.\n\nInventory is usually the biggest cash investment a business makes every year and if you do not have an inventory policy, then that cash investment has no approval process. If you are overstocked, have high levels of slow moving stock or obsolete stock, then you have invested cash without approval and you do not have an effective inventory policy. You wouldn’t let any other significant expenditure be made without a detailed approval process, so why inventory? Here are a few points on how to manage your inventory effectively. Make to Order (MTO) vs. Make to Stock (MTS)\nIf you are a manufacturing business then you should be carefully analysing the MTO and MTS. You should assess the frequency, value and volume of each product and then overlay this information with the commercial strategy. If a product is sold infrequently, generates low returns, and does not form part of a wider commercial offering, then it should not be MTS. In fact, it should probably be delisted altogether. It doesn’t make sense to invest your cash in all products equally. Isn’t it better to have more stock, and consequently a better service level, for those products that generate the most sales and the most revenue? This is the purpose of an ABC classification. An ABC classification, sometimes called ‘runners, repeaters, strangers’, is an opportunity to focus cash, and improved service levels, at the products that are critically important to your business. Broadly speaking your inventory targets should be comprised of two components, cycle stock and safety stock. Cycle stock is straightforward – it is the mean expected demand during the replenishment lead time. Safety stock is more complex, and often overlooked. Safety stock is a probability assessment of demand exceeding the mean during the replenishment lead time, combined with the probability of delays in the replenishment lead time. This should be properly calculated – rules of thumb do not work and will leave you with too little or too much stock. Devising an inventory policy is not a one-off exercise. As your business profile changes, new products will come in, old products will go out and sales will increase and decrease. These factors will impact your inventory targets and consequently you should be making revisions to your MTO\/MTS, portfolio classification and inventory targets periodically. If you do not have inventory management software then simple models can be developed in MS Excel to achieve this. Developing an inventory policy is not just about the known numbers; it is not purely an analytical exercise. You need to ensure that the analysis is overlaid with the expectations of the product life cycle, market promotions, sales strategies and commercial forecasts. It is important that there is cross-functional consensus from the commercial, finance and operations teams on the levels of inventory being targeted. Once you have an inventory policy established and a process for periodic review, then you should be looking at levers on how you can work to reduce stock. There are a number of methods you can use, but typically businesses should focus on:\n- Modifying service levels (reducing service against ‘B’ & ‘C’ class items);\n- Increasing MTO;\n- Introducing minimum order quantities (MOQs) for customers;\n- Negotiating higher frequency, lower volume deliveries with suppliers;\n- Rationalising the portfolio;\n- Improving forecasting and considering implementing Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP).\n\nPlus, as with any task where humans are involved, the risk of human error is potentially high, particularly if employees feel rushed to complete the process as quickly as possible to keep labor costs down. It’s also difficult to locate the source of any mismatched numbers in a periodic system because so much time passes between counts that it’s hard to know when and where the numbers became off. Smaller organizations tend to benefit more from periodic systems because the cost involved are more manageable with less inventory and fewer labor hours to consider. Perpetual inventory control systems take a different approach. Instead of only tracking inventory at periodic intervals, you track each item throughout its journey across your facility. From the moment you receive it, to the moment it is used in your operations, sold, or scrapped, it’s tracked. You get up-to-the-minute data on precisely where your items are and what they’re being used for. This data is gathered from sensors, barcodes, and scanners that keep tabs on items in real time, helping to eliminate errors from miscounts and helping your team pull inventory items more efficiently. The moment out-of-stock items are received and allocated to the proper bin, your team can be notified and begin using them immediately, instead of sitting on the shelf waiting for the next cycle count. The challenges of perpetual systems are different that those for periodic systems. Instead of needing large amounts of labor to perform counts, you need to invest money upfront in the sensors, barcodes, scanners, software, and other technology that helps you collect your data. And the more locations you have, the more equipment you need to buy. You’ll still need to perform cycle counts periodically to reconcile any incorrect numbers, but it’s far less often than with a periodic system. Ultimately, periodic inventory control systems are typically best suited for smaller organizations with few inventory items to manage and track. For larger companies with hundreds of items to keep track of, a perpetual control system is the more cost-effective option. How do I cost-effectively manage inventory? Alright so, you need to control you inventory to keep your costs down, but what’s the best way to do that? There are essentially three ways to manage inventory, regardless of what control system you use:\n- Paper checklists\n- Inventory management software\nEach system can be useful, but only one will help you keep costs down and improve your ROI. Let’s find out which one. Pen and paper checklists\nBelieve it or not, there are still many companies that attempt to manage their entire inventory with a pen and paper. This can work, if you are a very small business with just a few items that aren’t very critical to your operations. Doing everything by hand significantly increases the potential for human error and it requires a lot of time spent away from more productive tasks. The next step up from a pad of paper is spreadsheets. You can store an enormous amount of data in them, and your team can update them instantly as needed. The problem with spreadsheets is that when someone updates them, suddenly that specific version of the file is now the most up to date so if unless the next updates the exact same file, you no longer have a unified source of data. Spreadsheets still require manual updates and modifications so you’re still spending money for someone to keep that spreadsheet updated. While they can get the job done in some cases, spreadsheets are still not the most cost-effective way to manage complex inventories. Inventory management software\nData and automation are the tools of industry and are proven to help control costs and improve ROI. Apply these powerful tools to your inventory with inventory management software to get more from your inventory. With this software, you can implement a robust perpetual control system and track every item across your entire operation, even across multiple facilities. The best part about this is that you can instantly see where you inventory costs are going. Instead of waiting to reconcile your inventory accounting a few times a year, you can quickly tell which parts are not being used efficiently and which parts you aren’t using as much. In fact, most organizations don’t use as much as 90% of their MRO inventory every year and your software solution can show you what parts aren’t being utilized efficiently. Remember that money we were leaving on the table with inefficient purchasing and ordering methods for restocking inventory? Inventory management software helps ensure you don’t miss a single dollar.\n\nAre you looking for an effective way to manage and track inventory in your business? Inventory management and tracking services can help you stay on top of your stock levels, ensuring that you have the right amount of products on hand at all times. From tracking inventory levels to forecasting demand, these services can save you time and money while providing you with the peace of mind that your inventory is in good shape. With so many inventory management and tracking services on the market, it can be difficult to choose the right one for your needs. This article will provide an overview of the different types of services available and discuss the benefits they can offer. What is Inventory Management and Tracking?Inventory management and tracking is a process of managing and tracking inventory items, such as raw materials, parts, and finished products. It is typically done using a software system that tracks the quantity, location, and status of the items in the inventory. This system also helps with the ordering, storage, and delivery of items. The goal of inventory management and tracking is to ensure that a business has enough inventory to meet customer demand while minimizing costs. Benefits of Inventory Management and Tracking ServicesInventory management and tracking services provide businesses with a number of benefits, including improved accuracy and efficiency in managing inventory, better customer service, reduced costs, and improved product availability. By using an inventory management system, businesses can track the flow of goods through their warehouses or stores, allowing them to better manage their stock levels.

In today’s digital world, there is no excuse not to use technology to help manage a business. Discover the ways you can encourage your field service clients to increase their profitability and improve their business operations. As an accountant working with field service businesses, how do you help your clients manage, or increase, their profitability? If you want to add value to your field service partnerships, providing tools for your clients to run operations more efficiently, avoid losing profits and make smart decisions is something you might want to add to the top of your list. Here are three ways you can help your field service clients increase their profitability. Tip 1: Use workflow automation to streamline operations\nAlthough technology is widely used by businesses large and small, many businesses in the field service industry continue to run operations on paper. Field service management software, job management software, and other cloud-based software platforms provide workflow automation - the automatic execution of manual processes based on workflow rules. When businesses automate their processes, they can increase efficiency by working smarter rather than harder. How does workflow automation increase efficiency? Let’s say field staff are manually recording job details on paper and then bringing those slips of paper into a physical office. In this scenario, important information could go missing, office staff might spend unnecessary time deciphering messy handwriting, and data is recorded twice (once by their field staff and then again by the person handling billing and invoicing). Software with workflow automation capabilities as well as desktop and mobile features will help decrease the amount of errors created in transferring job details, remove the time spent on double data entry, and minimize the chance the information goes missing as it would now be automatically entered into your system. Overall, workflow automation helps businesses save time thus increasing billable hours, and increased billable hours leads to increased profits. Tip 2: Manage inventory from the cloud to avoid losing profits\nHow do your field service clients manage their inventory? Without a central location to track inventory and keep up with material costs, it is easy for field service businesses to lose track of what is in their warehouse or in the vans of their field staff. Encourage your clients to use inventory tracking software to gain full visibility of the materials on hand. This directly ties back into increasing profits as a clear picture into inventory levels will help these businesses make better purchasing decisions, avoid overstock and deter field staff from buying materials at a higher price on site. Some inventory management systems even allow users to import supplier catalogs and compare them side by side to determine the best pricing. Without cloud-based inventory management, field service businesses could be manually combing through supplier catalogs to find pricing, spend hours manually counting materials in their warehouse, or constantly need to follow up with field staff to determine what materials are on their vans. When all inventory-related information is housed in the cloud, determining inventory levels is quick and easy. Tip 3: Generate reports to make more profitable decisions\nWhen your field service clients have more information, you are able to help them make better-informed decisions. Generating reports through a field service management system is an easy way to gather data in one place and make sense of the data at hand. Encourage your clients to regularly use reporting in order to collect data from the day-to-day to discover trends within their business. For example, if a field service business wants to discover which jobs are most profitable versus those that are least profitable, a contract profitability report would be extremely helpful. This type of report would show the amount spent on resources and materials, the amount of time it took to complete a job or project, the total amount invoiced and other important details. Field service clients would be able to view the gross and net profits and compare across jobs to see which jobs are causing them to lose money and which ones bring in more money at less cost. Reporting on this type of information helps you assist your field service clients in making more profitable decisions. When your reporting is tied to a larger field service management solution, field service clients can automatically create reports based on data in their system and even set automation rules to receive scheduled reports at specified times. Workflow automation, cloud-based inventory management and reporting are three simple ways for field service businesses to successfully increase the profitability.

Inventory is often the largest asset a company has.\n\n5 Inventory Planning Best Practices\nIn a session we co-presented at the recent National Conference on Operations & Fulfillment in Las Vegas, we led a panel that delivered the following top five inventory planning best practices:\n- Build partnerships with suppliers. View your suppliers as subordinates and they’ll simply do your bidding. Work with them as partners and you’ll succeed together. You'll achieve more sales — with higher fulfillment, fewer overstocks and better inventory turnover — if you have a partner relationship with suppliers. Communicate with suppliers comprehensively and often. If they can anticipate your needs, they have a better chance of having raw materials and manufacturing capacity available when you need it. Establish these relationships so suppliers can tell you any bad news before delays in production or delivery impact your business. - Capture shadow or lost demand. Incomplete or inaccurate demand data leads to faulty demand planning and inaccurate purchasing decisions. What's more, it negatively impacts staff efficiency. Without accurate demand data, merchants can make incorrect decisions about strong vs. weak sellers. In addition, not capturing lost demand understates response rates and average order size, potentially impacting future list selection. - Measure both order and item fulfillment. Order fulfillment is the best measure of customer satisfaction. It gauges the percentage of customers that are shipped their orders complete at the time of order. The best measure of inventory buying performance is item fulfillment. This measures the percentage of individual items that are shipped to customers when ordered. Understand the relationship between the two so individual inventory buyers can comprehend their impact on total customer experience. - Forecast Internet demand. With Web sales growing to more than 50 percent of total sales for many catalogers, there's growing concern about how best to forecast. First, understand the true source of the demand. On average, only 10 percent to 20 percent of Internet demand is truly “incremental” and not driven by other media. There are two main approaches to online forecasting: time-phased modeling and traditional offer-based forecasting with demand curves. Both are valid. Ensure that you understand the marketing dynamics of your business to apply the appropriate mix of the two forecasting models. For details, see Ray Goodman’s March 2009 Catalog Success article, “Grab the Bull by Both Horns.”\n- Build processes for speed. Every day yields new information to consider. Success is directly related to the speed of receiving, processing and acting on new information. Whether it’s reforecasting demand, placing new purchase orders or adjusting existing ones, build systems and processes that maximize speed.

The key to an efficient and profitable business is total visibility into the inventory process from start to finish and management tools to help you maintain optimal stock levels year-round. An effective inventory management system helps you streamline all the moving parts of your warehouse: From recommending optimal stock levels all the way to keeping your supply chain organized and running smoothly. Learn the basics of inventory management and discover how an inventory management system can help you increase profitability and reduce waste. Inventory is usually one of the largest assets a company owns, which is why inventory mismanagement is one of the top reasons small businesses fail. Inefficient asset inventory management can decrease your profitability in several ways:\nHaving more stock on hand than you actually need can cost you. You have to pay for more warehouse space, which is expensive, and perishable items can spoil before you’re able to sell them. Staying ahead of the curve on retail trends helps you capitalize on the popular items customers want at the moment. If you’re slow to adapt to the changing market, however, customers will look elsewhere and you’ll surrender market share. Customers will order from somewhere else if you don’t have what they want in stock. At the very least, stockouts will cost you sales. If they happen often, you’ll lose customers. Investing in an inventory management system can yield excellent ROI. Not only does an inventory management system make it easier to get your products to the customers who want them, it can provide valuable insights so that you’re ordering the right inventory at the right time and in the right quantities. Here are some examples of how investing in inventory management pays off:\nOrder inventory in the right quantities at the right time so that you’re never over- or under-stocked. More productivity and less time wasted looking for missing items or tracking things by hand. Well-managed stock leads to more efficient and organized warehouses. Orders ship faster and are more accurate, leading to satisfied customers and upheld service level agreements. Inventory is considered a business asset, so inventory management ties in closely with accounting. When inventory and accounting are integrated well, you get real-time metrics into your goods at every step of the process. Your inventory management system should support multiple inventory valuation methods and functions such as:\nThe cost of goods sold divided by average inventory on hand. Low turnover rate indicates duplicate orders and deteriorating inventory value. High turnover rate can mean excess shipping costs to quickly replace things that are out of stock, incomplete orders, and wasted time trying to locate missing items. Balanced turnover rate indicates high efficiency, lower costs, and higher customer satisfaction. The cost of available goods for sale divided by the number of units for sale. This metric yields the weighted average cost per unit. Estimate of the expected cost for an item in the accounting records, which is periodically checked against the actual cost. The variance between the two numbers is recorded in the accounting records. This method is used when it’s too time-consuming to track actual costs in real time. Refers to the list of sub-items that make up a single inventory item. Bundling the parts and items that make up a single finished item. A logistics term that refers to receiving inventory just before or at the exact time it’s needed. Tracks inventory from manufacturing to when it’s used on the production shop or factory floor. Inventory management software tracks, manages, and organizes inventory levels, orders, sales, and deliveries. The purpose of inventory management software is to maintain an optimal inventory level, track goods during transport between locations, receive new items, manage warehouse processes such as picking, packing, and shipping, prevent product obsolescence and spoilage, and ensure your products are never out of stock. Software for inventory management automates what used to be a time-consuming, manual process of counting each item one by one and recording it on paper. Digitizing this process not only makes it more accurate, it saves valuable time. Core capabilities include inventory optimization, product identification and tracking, service management for service-oriented companies, asset tracking, and reorder points.\n\nQuestion:What's the best way to manage inventory for a service business?","passages":[{"passage":"Business Inventory Management Tips If you want your company to run smoothly, you require to track your stock in a systematic method.

In other words, have the right parts at the right place at the right time. Assuring supply can easily be achieved by stocking the shelves with every imaginable spare part in such enormous quantities that almost any combination of required materials is in stock at any given time. This will surely satisfy service objectives, but is this the best approach? Unfortunately, nothing in life is free. Materials cost money and take up plenty of space, and very few materials managers have access to unlimited funds. Finance and plant management are responsible for making sure that purchasing budgets are monitored and controlled, and inventory investment levels are optimized. Uncontrolled spending leads to bloated inventory, which in turn often results in mandated investment reductions. But managing inventory is not as easy as just setting the objective and then expecting it to happen all by itself. Nor is it simply a matter of cutting off funding or randomly eliminating parts from the storeroom. These may have the desired effect on investment, but what about service and, more importantly, the potential impact in terms of lost production? This leaves materials management in the difficult predicament of having to concurrently maintain adequate levels of material supply while also prudently managing the company's resources. Some would consider these conflicting goals resulting in a dilemma - a situation that requires choosing between two different alternatives. But, is it? To effectively support maintenance and production, it is critical to have the required parts available when needed. Finance and plant management will generally support the purchase of materials necessary to keep plant equipment running in order to maintain production levels. However, \"available\" doesn't have to mean \"on the shelf,\" and \"when needed\" doesn't necessarily imply \"right away.\" There is a point at which both service and investment are optimized so that they become mutually achievable objectives. Having said that, it isn't a simple task to accomplish, and as with any significant challenge, the best way to begin is to understand the problem and develop a plan of attack. Effective inventory management requires an understanding of the fundamental material management principles, data and work processes that impact material supply and contribute to the total cost of the MRO operation. It also involves the establishment of realistic and measurable goals, along with disciplined approaches for achieving them. Most importantly, it requires a commitment of time from knowledgeable individuals to make informed, intelligent and often difficult decisions. The blueprint for success is Integrated Inventory Management. This methodology provides a vehicle that helps arrive at the right decisions about what to buy, when to buy it, what to keep in stock and what to eliminate. It provides a disciplined process that effectively controls storeroom investment and associated inventory costs while maintaining an acceptable level of service. This article provides an overview of the basic elements of Integrated Inventory Management and key linkages. Subsequent articles to be published on the Reliable Plant Web site (www.reliableplant.com) will provide additional details that further explain each of the specific activities involved. Figure 1. An illustration of the Integrated Inventory Management Model.Integrated Inventory Management Model\nIn the model, the blue-shaded figures represent stand-alone inventory management processes.

Together, the work processes and associated information form a logical sequence of activities that build on one another. The overall Integrated Inventory Management model begins with a foundation that is focused on basic data integrity. From there, the concentration is on practical application of work processes that rely on this data to establish a baseline for improvement. The next step is to develop realistic goals and action plans that will help control inventory and achieve those goals.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:4d3182b5-0942-4dd1-a3d3-89dadea92c08>"]},{"passage":"Inventory is usually the biggest cash investment a business makes every year and if you do not have an inventory policy, then that cash investment has no approval process. If you are overstocked, have high levels of slow moving stock or obsolete stock, then you have invested cash without approval and you do not have an effective inventory policy. You wouldn’t let any other significant expenditure be made without a detailed approval process, so why inventory? Here are a few points on how to manage your inventory effectively. Make to Order (MTO) vs. Make to Stock (MTS)\nIf you are a manufacturing business then you should be carefully analysing the MTO and MTS. You should assess the frequency, value and volume of each product and then overlay this information with the commercial strategy. If a product is sold infrequently, generates low returns, and does not form part of a wider commercial offering, then it should not be MTS. In fact, it should probably be delisted altogether. It doesn’t make sense to invest your cash in all products equally. Isn’t it better to have more stock, and consequently a better service level, for those products that generate the most sales and the most revenue? This is the purpose of an ABC classification. An ABC classification, sometimes called ‘runners, repeaters, strangers’, is an opportunity to focus cash, and improved service levels, at the products that are critically important to your business. Broadly speaking your inventory targets should be comprised of two components, cycle stock and safety stock. Cycle stock is straightforward – it is the mean expected demand during the replenishment lead time. Safety stock is more complex, and often overlooked. Safety stock is a probability assessment of demand exceeding the mean during the replenishment lead time, combined with the probability of delays in the replenishment lead time. This should be properly calculated – rules of thumb do not work and will leave you with too little or too much stock. Devising an inventory policy is not a one-off exercise. As your business profile changes, new products will come in, old products will go out and sales will increase and decrease. These factors will impact your inventory targets and consequently you should be making revisions to your MTO\/MTS, portfolio classification and inventory targets periodically. If you do not have inventory management software then simple models can be developed in MS Excel to achieve this. Developing an inventory policy is not just about the known numbers; it is not purely an analytical exercise. You need to ensure that the analysis is overlaid with the expectations of the product life cycle, market promotions, sales strategies and commercial forecasts. It is important that there is cross-functional consensus from the commercial, finance and operations teams on the levels of inventory being targeted. Once you have an inventory policy established and a process for periodic review, then you should be looking at levers on how you can work to reduce stock. There are a number of methods you can use, but typically businesses should focus on:\n- Modifying service levels (reducing service against ‘B’ & ‘C’ class items);\n- Increasing MTO;\n- Introducing minimum order quantities (MOQs) for customers;\n- Negotiating higher frequency, lower volume deliveries with suppliers;\n- Rationalising the portfolio;\n- Improving forecasting and considering implementing Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP).","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:092907a1-da56-46d8-baf7-0b2189d01c52>"]},{"passage":"Plus, as with any task where humans are involved, the risk of human error is potentially high, particularly if employees feel rushed to complete the process as quickly as possible to keep labor costs down. It’s also difficult to locate the source of any mismatched numbers in a periodic system because so much time passes between counts that it’s hard to know when and where the numbers became off. Smaller organizations tend to benefit more from periodic systems because the cost involved are more manageable with less inventory and fewer labor hours to consider. Perpetual inventory control systems take a different approach. Instead of only tracking inventory at periodic intervals, you track each item throughout its journey across your facility. From the moment you receive it, to the moment it is used in your operations, sold, or scrapped, it’s tracked. You get up-to-the-minute data on precisely where your items are and what they’re being used for. This data is gathered from sensors, barcodes, and scanners that keep tabs on items in real time, helping to eliminate errors from miscounts and helping your team pull inventory items more efficiently. The moment out-of-stock items are received and allocated to the proper bin, your team can be notified and begin using them immediately, instead of sitting on the shelf waiting for the next cycle count. The challenges of perpetual systems are different that those for periodic systems. Instead of needing large amounts of labor to perform counts, you need to invest money upfront in the sensors, barcodes, scanners, software, and other technology that helps you collect your data. And the more locations you have, the more equipment you need to buy. You’ll still need to perform cycle counts periodically to reconcile any incorrect numbers, but it’s far less often than with a periodic system. Ultimately, periodic inventory control systems are typically best suited for smaller organizations with few inventory items to manage and track. For larger companies with hundreds of items to keep track of, a perpetual control system is the more cost-effective option. How do I cost-effectively manage inventory? Alright so, you need to control you inventory to keep your costs down, but what’s the best way to do that? There are essentially three ways to manage inventory, regardless of what control system you use:\n- Paper checklists\n- Inventory management software\nEach system can be useful, but only one will help you keep costs down and improve your ROI. Let’s find out which one. Pen and paper checklists\nBelieve it or not, there are still many companies that attempt to manage their entire inventory with a pen and paper. This can work, if you are a very small business with just a few items that aren’t very critical to your operations. Doing everything by hand significantly increases the potential for human error and it requires a lot of time spent away from more productive tasks. The next step up from a pad of paper is spreadsheets. You can store an enormous amount of data in them, and your team can update them instantly as needed. The problem with spreadsheets is that when someone updates them, suddenly that specific version of the file is now the most up to date so if unless the next updates the exact same file, you no longer have a unified source of data. Spreadsheets still require manual updates and modifications so you’re still spending money for someone to keep that spreadsheet updated. While they can get the job done in some cases, spreadsheets are still not the most cost-effective way to manage complex inventories. Inventory management software\nData and automation are the tools of industry and are proven to help control costs and improve ROI. Apply these powerful tools to your inventory with inventory management software to get more from your inventory. With this software, you can implement a robust perpetual control system and track every item across your entire operation, even across multiple facilities. The best part about this is that you can instantly see where you inventory costs are going. Instead of waiting to reconcile your inventory accounting a few times a year, you can quickly tell which parts are not being used efficiently and which parts you aren’t using as much. In fact, most organizations don’t use as much as 90% of their MRO inventory every year and your software solution can show you what parts aren’t being utilized efficiently. Remember that money we were leaving on the table with inefficient purchasing and ordering methods for restocking inventory? Inventory management software helps ensure you don’t miss a single dollar.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:39963059-682d-4846-8951-ddc03e99a3b6>"]},{"passage":"Are you looking for an effective way to manage and track inventory in your business?

In today’s digital world, there is no excuse not to use technology to help manage a business. Discover the ways you can encourage your field service clients to increase their profitability and improve their business operations. As an accountant working with field service businesses, how do you help your clients manage, or increase, their profitability? If you want to add value to your field service partnerships, providing tools for your clients to run operations more efficiently, avoid losing profits and make smart decisions is something you might want to add to the top of your list. Here are three ways you can help your field service clients increase their profitability. Tip 1: Use workflow automation to streamline operations\nAlthough technology is widely used by businesses large and small, many businesses in the field service industry continue to run operations on paper. Field service management software, job management software, and other cloud-based software platforms provide workflow automation - the automatic execution of manual processes based on workflow rules. When businesses automate their processes, they can increase efficiency by working smarter rather than harder. How does workflow automation increase efficiency? Let’s say field staff are manually recording job details on paper and then bringing those slips of paper into a physical office. In this scenario, important information could go missing, office staff might spend unnecessary time deciphering messy handwriting, and data is recorded twice (once by their field staff and then again by the person handling billing and invoicing). Software with workflow automation capabilities as well as desktop and mobile features will help decrease the amount of errors created in transferring job details, remove the time spent on double data entry, and minimize the chance the information goes missing as it would now be automatically entered into your system. Overall, workflow automation helps businesses save time thus increasing billable hours, and increased billable hours leads to increased profits. Tip 2: Manage inventory from the cloud to avoid losing profits\nHow do your field service clients manage their inventory? Without a central location to track inventory and keep up with material costs, it is easy for field service businesses to lose track of what is in their warehouse or in the vans of their field staff. Encourage your clients to use inventory tracking software to gain full visibility of the materials on hand. This directly ties back into increasing profits as a clear picture into inventory levels will help these businesses make better purchasing decisions, avoid overstock and deter field staff from buying materials at a higher price on site. Some inventory management systems even allow users to import supplier catalogs and compare them side by side to determine the best pricing. Without cloud-based inventory management, field service businesses could be manually combing through supplier catalogs to find pricing, spend hours manually counting materials in their warehouse, or constantly need to follow up with field staff to determine what materials are on their vans. When all inventory-related information is housed in the cloud, determining inventory levels is quick and easy. Tip 3: Generate reports to make more profitable decisions\nWhen your field service clients have more information, you are able to help them make better-informed decisions. Generating reports through a field service management system is an easy way to gather data in one place and make sense of the data at hand. Encourage your clients to regularly use reporting in order to collect data from the day-to-day to discover trends within their business. For example, if a field service business wants to discover which jobs are most profitable versus those that are least profitable, a contract profitability report would be extremely helpful. This type of report would show the amount spent on resources and materials, the amount of time it took to complete a job or project, the total amount invoiced and other important details. Field service clients would be able to view the gross and net profits and compare across jobs to see which jobs are causing them to lose money and which ones bring in more money at less cost. Reporting on this type of information helps you assist your field service clients in making more profitable decisions. When your reporting is tied to a larger field service management solution, field service clients can automatically create reports based on data in their system and even set automation rules to receive scheduled reports at specified times. Workflow automation, cloud-based inventory management and reporting are three simple ways for field service businesses to successfully increase the profitability.

View your suppliers as subordinates and they’ll simply do your bidding. Work with them as partners and you’ll succeed together. You'll achieve more sales — with higher fulfillment, fewer overstocks and better inventory turnover — if you have a partner relationship with suppliers. Communicate with suppliers comprehensively and often. If they can anticipate your needs, they have a better chance of having raw materials and manufacturing capacity available when you need it. Establish these relationships so suppliers can tell you any bad news before delays in production or delivery impact your business. - Capture shadow or lost demand. Incomplete or inaccurate demand data leads to faulty demand planning and inaccurate purchasing decisions. What's more, it negatively impacts staff efficiency. Without accurate demand data, merchants can make incorrect decisions about strong vs. weak sellers. In addition, not capturing lost demand understates response rates and average order size, potentially impacting future list selection. - Measure both order and item fulfillment. Order fulfillment is the best measure of customer satisfaction. It gauges the percentage of customers that are shipped their orders complete at the time of order. The best measure of inventory buying performance is item fulfillment. This measures the percentage of individual items that are shipped to customers when ordered. Understand the relationship between the two so individual inventory buyers can comprehend their impact on total customer experience. - Forecast Internet demand. With Web sales growing to more than 50 percent of total sales for many catalogers, there's growing concern about how best to forecast. First, understand the true source of the demand. On average, only 10 percent to 20 percent of Internet demand is truly “incremental” and not driven by other media. There are two main approaches to online forecasting: time-phased modeling and traditional offer-based forecasting with demand curves. Both are valid. Ensure that you understand the marketing dynamics of your business to apply the appropriate mix of the two forecasting models. For details, see Ray Goodman’s March 2009 Catalog Success article, “Grab the Bull by Both Horns.”\n- Build processes for speed. Every day yields new information to consider. Success is directly related to the speed of receiving, processing and acting on new information. Whether it’s reforecasting demand, placing new purchase orders or adjusting existing ones, build systems and processes that maximize speed.

The key to an efficient and profitable business is total visibility into the inventory process from start to finish and management tools to help you maintain optimal stock levels year-round. An effective inventory management system helps you streamline all the moving parts of your warehouse: From recommending optimal stock levels all the way to keeping your supply chain organized and running smoothly. Learn the basics of inventory management and discover how an inventory management system can help you increase profitability and reduce waste. Inventory is usually one of the largest assets a company owns, which is why inventory mismanagement is one of the top reasons small businesses fail. Inefficient asset inventory management can decrease your profitability in several ways:\nHaving more stock on hand than you actually need can cost you. You have to pay for more warehouse space, which is expensive, and perishable items can spoil before you’re able to sell them. Staying ahead of the curve on retail trends helps you capitalize on the popular items customers want at the moment. If you’re slow to adapt to the changing market, however, customers will look elsewhere and you’ll surrender market share. Customers will order from somewhere else if you don’t have what they want in stock. At the very least, stockouts will cost you sales. If they happen often, you’ll lose customers. Investing in an inventory management system can yield excellent ROI. Not only does an inventory management system make it easier to get your products to the customers who want them, it can provide valuable insights so that you’re ordering the right inventory at the right time and in the right quantities. Here are some examples of how investing in inventory management pays off:\nOrder inventory in the right quantities at the right time so that you’re never over- or under-stocked. More productivity and less time wasted looking for missing items or tracking things by hand. Well-managed stock leads to more efficient and organized warehouses. Orders ship faster and are more accurate, leading to satisfied customers and upheld service level agreements. Inventory is considered a business asset, so inventory management ties in closely with accounting. When inventory and accounting are integrated well, you get real-time metrics into your goods at every step of the process. Your inventory management system should support multiple inventory valuation methods and functions such as:\nThe cost of goods sold divided by average inventory on hand. Low turnover rate indicates duplicate orders and deteriorating inventory value. High turnover rate can mean excess shipping costs to quickly replace things that are out of stock, incomplete orders, and wasted time trying to locate missing items. Balanced turnover rate indicates high efficiency, lower costs, and higher customer satisfaction. The cost of available goods for sale divided by the number of units for sale. This metric yields the weighted average cost per unit. Estimate of the expected cost for an item in the accounting records, which is periodically checked against the actual cost. The variance between the two numbers is recorded in the accounting records. This method is used when it’s too time-consuming to track actual costs in real time. Refers to the list of sub-items that make up a single inventory item. Bundling the parts and items that make up a single finished item. A logistics term that refers to receiving inventory just before or at the exact time it’s needed. Tracks inventory from manufacturing to when it’s used on the production shop or factory floor. Inventory management software tracks, manages, and organizes inventory levels, orders, sales, and deliveries. The purpose of inventory management software is to maintain an optimal inventory level, track goods during transport between locations, receive new items, manage warehouse processes such as picking, packing, and shipping, prevent product obsolescence and spoilage, and ensure your products are never out of stock. Software for inventory management automates what used to be a time-consuming, manual process of counting each item one by one and recording it on paper. Digitizing this process not only makes it more accurate, it saves valuable time. Core capabilities include inventory optimization, product identification and tracking, service management for service-oriented companies, asset tracking, and reorder points.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:198c1140-04e3-4e42-9556-c7be2880e20e>"]}]}
