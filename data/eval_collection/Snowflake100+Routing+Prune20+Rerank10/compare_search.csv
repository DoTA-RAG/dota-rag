MELBOURNE’S POLISH POTTERY MIXES PATTERNS, CELEBRATES COLORS AND OFFERS AN ADVENTUROUS SHOPPING EXPERIENCE
For Polish Pottery owner Teresa Beach, the traditional stoneware was a passion before it became a business. While living in Europe for many years, Beach visited Poland in 1993 and became a collector of the brightly colored and patterned pieces. She began sending gifts home to her mother and sister-in-law, and after they fell in love as well, she began to wonder if there might be a market for Polish pottery. When she returned home to Florida in 1999, the Polish Pottery business was born. 100 DIFFERENT PATTERNS AND MORE THAN 200 UNIQUE SHAPES. The warehouse itself is a hidden gem, located in an industrial area along Wickham Road at 3185 New York Avenue #13, in Melbourne. But walking through the doors into the 4,000 square feet of retail space filled with color and pattern is an amazing experience. “I’ve heard it’s an adventure coming into the store. It can be a little overwhelming the first time you come in, with so many choices. I suggest taking a stroll through the entire store to get a better idea of what’s available.”
Beach is happy to walk customers through the offerings and is a wealth of information about the history, artistry and utilitarianism of Polish pottery. “One great feature of Polish pottery is you can create your own unique collection by mixing and matching patterns, and the more you get, the easier it is to add another.”Each piece is hand painted in Poland, and the high firing temperatures create durable, utilitarian stoneware covered in intricate, beautiful decorations. All Polish pottery is oven, microwave and dishwasher safe, making it perfectly suited for everyday use. “It’s essentially functional art,” Beach said. “Some pieces are labeled UNIKAT, meaning ‘unique’ in Polish. Collectors are sure to find some unique pieces to add to their collection.”But for Beach, the things that make certain pieces special are the holiday and family memories wrapped up in her collection. “I have so many traditional pieces I’ve had in my house forever — casseroles and plates I served Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners on year after year. Those are my favorites because they hold such wonderful memories.”

I'm Anna and I run my small business from home in rural Stirlingshire, Scotland. My love for Polish pottery began with my own collection, which grew until I replaced most of my tableware with it. After receiving many compliments and buying a lot of pieces as gifts for friends and family, I decided to spread my love for Polish pottery and Groshek Pottery was born. Groshek (or groszek) means ""polka dot"" in Polish, which reflects the many beautiful spotty designs that Polish pottery is renowned for. What is Polish pottery? Every piece of Polish pottery is handmade and hand-decorated using stamps and brushes. It comes in hundreds of shapes, with patterns ranging from classic dots and “peacock eyes” to more intricate “artistic” or “UNIKAT” patterns. My pottery comes from Zaklady Ceramiczne “Boleslawiec”, which is one of the biggest manufacturers in the region and whose tradition goes back to the 19th century. Caring for your pottery
The high quality of the clay combined with the manufacturing process make Polish pottery extremely durable. Fired at over 1200°C, it is classed as stoneware and safe to use in dishwashers, microwaves and fridges. This makes Polish pottery suitable for everyday use at home and in catering. All dishes with a grooved bottom are also safe to use in traditional gas or electric ovens up to 280°C, as well as on glass, ceramic and electric hobs.

What is Polish Pottery? In simple terms, it is functional art. Broken down in more simple terms, it is a product made from a dense white clay, twice glazed and fired at extremely high temperatures. The region where this comes from used to be part of Germany but is now Boleslawiec, Poland. The clay is the secret here. It is beautifully “white” allowing for various colors to stand out. This makes for the perfect artist pallet and Boleslawiec is a region known for it’s artists. The clay is dense. It does make it heavier but the product is superior. As long as you follow a few simple rules, it will last longer than any of us will. It does not chip like cheaper, lighter stoneware that is more porous. The double glaze allows for a scratch resistant surface that is lead and cadmium free. POLISH POTTERY IT IS 100% SAFE TO USE. IT IS OVEN SAFE, MICROWAVE SAFE, DISHWASHER SAFE AND FREEZER SAFE. In fact I have even cooked an entire dinner in this stoneware using only my grill. I’ll go into depth later about the patterns of polish pottery but for now it’s only important that you know that every single piece is done by hand. The pieces are cast from molds but the painting is unique. There is no mass production in the creation of this product. Orders take 6-9 months to complete. There are different levels of artistry (again, I’ll expand on that in another article) which will affect the price. You’ll notice that 95% of my pictures are taken using Polish pottery. That’s because it is the primary serving and cooking tools in my kitchen. Where can you buy Polish Pottery? Pacific Polish Pottery is the best place. Family owned since 2000, they know everything there is to know. They offer free shipping on orders over $99.00 and they are always listing new pieces. Same day shipping in many cases, reward points and friendly customer service are just a few reasons to visit their store.

So what is Polish Pottery anyway? Polish pottery has been popping up all over the United States in recent years. It’s been featured in magazines like Better Homes and Gardens. You can find pieces in stores and online. But if you’ve never seen it before, you might be wondering just what exactly is so great about it. So here are 5 great reasons to check out polish pottery for yourself. 1) Polish Pottery is handmade. Polish Pottery is made by hand out of white clay found in Boleslawiec, Poland. The patterns are all hand stamped and/or hand designed by local artists. This means that each piece is slightly different, which adds to the charm of the pottery. 2) There’s something for everyone. There are hundreds of patterns available in Polish Pottery. Everything from the traditional peacock eye pattern, to beautiful flower patterns. There are seasonal patterns too! Snowmen for Christmas, stars and stripes for 4th of July…you name it and they make it. 3) Durability. I use my Polish Pottery every day and it still looks beautiful. It’s microwave safe, oven safe, and dishwasher safe. It doesn’t chip easily, and it evenly distributes heat to your food. 4) The endless ability to mix and match. Remember those hundreds of patterns we talked about earlier, well you can mix and match them to your heart’s content. Many of the pieces feature similar colors, so they look great together on your table. Decide that you’re bored with stars and peacock eyes, you can always buy a few Blue Tulip or Blue Poppy patterns to mix in. Endless possibilities means endless fun! 5) It’s simply beautiful. If you’ve never seen it before, stop by our website (http://www.thepolishpotterygarden.com) and take a look at our inventory. It really does speak for itself.

Paula Shalan 18hx20'wx8'D ""Birches of acadia"" slab built, hand polished slip, sgraffito, smoke fired white earthenware
A seed pod has a smooth exterior, and within, a richly complex structure. You might notice the dry, rough, cracking bark of a tree, and beneath is the smooth, fresh, unblemished surface. I’m moved by these sensual contrasts. I admire the way you do not overwork a piece to the point where people have to guess or be surprised at what the object is all about, other than the obvious, that it is some sort of vessel. do people tend to see right away a sense of either super primitive, or ultra modern? Paula: I think people realize that my pots contain both a sense of primitive and modern design. they see the ancient and traditional techniques but in new, innovative ways. I leave evidence of the way the piece was constructed. I find beauty in seams and joints. overworking a pot may lead towards a seamless perfection, but it can diminish the sense of fresh energy. I want my work to express the constant fluidity of life that honors material and process. the Japanese term “wabi sabi” describes this aesthetic. It is a way of living that finds beauty in imperfection. What kind of clay do you favor using, and why? Paula: I use a low-fire clay from Sheffield Pottery called Mass White. It has terrific strength at my very low firing temperature. I do a preliminary (bisque) firing in my electric kiln, transforming the clay to a white color. In the smoke firing, “naked” Mass White absorbs less carbon than the areas with the polished slip. the bare clay turns a lovely gray that contrasts nicely with the intense black of the polished slip surface. Paula, tell me more about your firing process. Paula: outside I have small kiln I built from house bricks. I fill this with a mix of hardwood shavings and my pots. I add a bit of newspaper and light it. Within a few minutes, the shavings are burning and I cover the kiln. It burns for about 24 hours. Smoke firing is very unpredictable. on a windy or rainy day the pots can have a very dynamic and smokey look to their surface. over the last few years, I have been working with either texture or line drawings on my work, and do not want the atmospheric, smokey look to detract from the form and surface design. So I had to come up with a way to achieve a more uniform black/gray surface. to do this, each piece is wrapped individually in a single sheet of newspaper, then in foil, and then placed in the kiln. As the paper burns, the smoke is trapped against the pot by this foil saggar. the results are a very even black/gray. What do you have in your studio that, say, painters do not have? Paula: In addition to my electric kiln for bisque firing, one of my most frequently used tools is a large rolling pin for rolling out slabs of clay. And of course, I have hundreds of “found tools” for creating various textures. My favorite textures are created from both common and uncommon items: a serrated steak knife, a non-slip
rug mat, an oversized wooden bead from Africa, and the end of a bamboo paint brush. I also have boxes and boxes filled with objects that I have collected from nature: coral, seed pods, sea grass, tiny animal bones... I use these for impressions in the soft clay and for inspiration. I’ve always loved the glazing process, but your unique surface comes from the use of terra sigillata (polished slip). fascinating! Tell me more! Paula: Yes, I make the terra sigillata myself. It is basically the finest particles of clay separated out from the coarser ones. It is a very refined clay slip that has the consistency of skim milk. I paint multiple coats over the surface of my pot before it is fired. this is done at the bone-dry stage, when the pots are very fragile. At just the right moment, when the terra sigilatta has lost its wet look but still remains moist, I polish the entire surface.

Do You Know What Pottery Truly Is? As a reply the the question above, you might simply say 'making of pots'. It is but natural for you to be surprised and amazed when you read through this website and discover that there is so much more to pottery. If you look up the word 'pottery' in a dictionary, you would come across two meanings, one of which would describe it as the craftsmanship of an individual who makes pots and the other would be indicative of a place where such wares are made. While both are correct, the concept of pottery that people carry all over the world pertains to objects that are made of different varieties of clay. Therefore, a product that emerges from a pottery could be earthenware, stoneware or porcelain, depending on the manner of treatment of clay. A peek into the past shows that human association with pottery dates all the way back to the Neolithic era. Civilization in that epoch was scattered in pockets around the world and parts of Czech Republic, China, Japan, Africa and South America that were inhabited by Neolithic humans were witness to the emergence and subsequent use of pottery as a field. Objects uncovered from excavation sites in these regions not just speak eloquently of the method and style of pottery that was in vogue but also of its relevance in everyday life of people. Irrespective of ethnic origins of the maker, there are certain rules pertaining to pottery which are universally accepted and these are -
- Clay is molded into the requisite shape after having been kneaded and subjected to high temperature to rid it of the last remnant drops of water. - The oven in which clay models are heated up is known as a kiln and its purpose is to strengthen and harden the clay so that it does not lose its shape. - Subsequent to the heat treatment, the clay object is decorated, wedged, dried and fired so that it is ready for being used. While there might be a few extra steps or shorter methods, this is the basic pattern followed by pottery artisans the world over to give shape to their imagination. Before we continue, I am sure you have questions on the purpose of this website and what you will gain from it. The story begins when I was looking for a suitable domain name for my website. I first brainstormed on the best brand names I could think of and made a list of 50 names. I then went to NameCheap and tried to search for these names, hoping to purchase one. Not a single one was available! Frustrated, I spent the next several hours trying to come up with different names. The ones I really liked were never available, while the only ones available seemed either too spammy or did not have enough brand value. This ordeal ended when I finally aquired the domain from the godaddy auctions using the awesome chrome extension. Luckily I found this domain in a closeout auction and only had to pay an additional 10 dollars for it. In the future, I am just going to buy them off godaddy's closeout auctions instead of wasting hours trying to find the right one. Although NameCheap is my prefered registrar, I am quite happy having some domains over at GoDaddys. Now back to the main topic, where I tell you about the different types of clays. Types of Clay
Have you ever wondered as to why objects that appear not to share any similarities or do not resemble each other even remotely are classified under the label of 'pottery'? The answer to this is quite simple - they have been made from different types of clay and hence are reflective of the traits of the particular variety or varieties. Types of clay that are commonly used for the purpose of pottery are -
- Kaolin - Credit for having discovered and employed this type for making objects goes to the Chinese and this explains as to why it is also popularly referred to as China Clay. One of its most well known uses pertains to creation of porcelain objects which have earned China renown all over the world. - Bentonite - Best known for its plasticity, this variety is mostly used in combination with other less plastic varieties so as to render them more malleable. - Fire clay - Somewhat similar to Kaolin but characterized by a lower flux rate, fire clay is known for its resistance to heat despite the name 'fire'.","[{'passage': 'This Polish pottery Bowl\nis made by Ceramika Artystyczna\nworkshop in Boleslawiec, Poland.

You might notice the dry, rough, cracking bark of a tree, and beneath is the smooth, fresh, unblemished surface. I’m moved by these sensual contrasts. I admire the way you do not overwork a piece to the point where people have to guess or be surprised at what the object is all about, other than the obvious, that it is some sort of vessel. do people tend to see right away a sense of either super primitive, or ultra modern? Paula: I think people realize that my pots contain both a sense of primitive and modern design. they see the ancient and traditional techniques but in new, innovative ways. I leave evidence of the way the piece was constructed. I find beauty in seams and joints. overworking a pot may lead towards a seamless perfection, but it can diminish the sense of fresh energy. I want my work to express the constant fluidity of life that honors material and process. the Japanese term “wabi sabi” describes this aesthetic. It is a way of living that finds beauty in imperfection. What kind of clay do you favor using, and why? Paula: I use a low-fire clay from Sheffield Pottery called Mass White. It has terrific strength at my very low firing temperature. I do a preliminary (bisque) firing in my electric kiln, transforming the clay to a white color. In the smoke firing, “naked” Mass White absorbs less carbon than the areas with the polished slip. the bare clay turns a lovely gray that contrasts nicely with the intense black of the polished slip surface. Paula, tell me more about your firing process. Paula: outside I have small kiln I built from house bricks. I fill this with a mix of hardwood shavings and my pots. I add a bit of newspaper and light it. Within a few minutes, the shavings are burning and I cover the kiln. It burns for about 24 hours. Smoke firing is very unpredictable. on a windy or rainy day the pots can have a very dynamic and smokey look to their surface. over the last few years, I have been working with either texture or line drawings on my work, and do not want the atmospheric, smokey look to detract from the form and surface design. So I had to come up with a way to achieve a more uniform black/gray surface. to do this, each piece is wrapped individually in a single sheet of newspaper, then in foil, and then placed in the kiln. As the paper burns, the smoke is trapped against the pot by this foil saggar. the results are a very even black/gray. What do you have in your studio that, say, painters do not have? Paula: In addition to my electric kiln for bisque firing, one of my most frequently used tools is a large rolling pin for rolling out slabs of clay. And of course, I have hundreds of “found tools” for creating various textures. My favorite textures are created from both common and uncommon items: a serrated steak knife, a non-slip\nrug mat, an oversized wooden bead from Africa, and the end of a bamboo paint brush. I also have boxes and boxes filled with objects that I have collected from nature: coral, seed pods, sea grass, tiny animal bones... I use these for impressions in the soft clay and for inspiration. I’ve always loved the glazing process, but your unique surface comes from the use of terra sigillata (polished slip). fascinating! Tell me more! Paula: Yes, I make the terra sigillata myself. It is basically the finest particles of clay separated out from the coarser ones. It is a very refined clay slip that has the consistency of skim milk. I paint multiple coats over the surface of my pot before it is fired. this is done at the bone-dry stage, when the pots are very fragile. At just the right moment, when the terra sigilatta has lost its wet look but still remains moist, I polish the entire surface.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:d21d8b3a-f59e-4595-83d5-d12cdf6abe8a>']}, {'passage': ""Do You Know What Pottery Truly Is? As a reply the the question above, you might simply say 'making of pots'. It is but natural for you to be surprised and amazed when you read through this website and discover that there is so much more to pottery. If you look up the word 'pottery' in a dictionary, you would come across two meanings, one of which would describe it as the craftsmanship of an individual who makes pots and the other would be indicative of a place where such wares are made. While both are correct, the concept of pottery that people carry all over the world pertains to objects that are made of different varieties of clay. Therefore, a product that emerges from a pottery could be earthenware, stoneware or porcelain, depending on the manner of treatment of clay. A peek into the past shows that human association with pottery dates all the way back to the Neolithic era. Civilization in that epoch was scattered in pockets around the world and parts of Czech Republic, China, Japan, Africa and South America that were inhabited by Neolithic humans were witness to the emergence and subsequent use of pottery as a field. Objects uncovered from excavation sites in these regions not just speak eloquently of the method and style of pottery that was in vogue but also of its relevance in everyday life of people. Irrespective of ethnic origins of the maker, there are certain rules pertaining to pottery which are universally accepted and these are -\n- Clay is molded into the requisite shape after having been kneaded and subjected to high temperature to rid it of the last remnant drops of water. - The oven in which clay models are heated up is known as a kiln and its purpose is to strengthen and harden the clay so that it does not lose its shape. - Subsequent to the heat treatment, the clay object is decorated, wedged, dried and fired so that it is ready for being used. While there might be a few extra steps or shorter methods, this is the basic pattern followed by pottery artisans the world over to give shape to their imagination. Before we continue, I am sure you have questions on the purpose of this website and what you will gain from it. The story begins when I was looking for a suitable domain name for my website. I first brainstormed on the best brand names I could think of and made a list of 50 names. I then went to NameCheap and tried to search for these names, hoping to purchase one. Not a single one was available! Frustrated, I spent the next several hours trying to come up with different names. The ones I really liked were never available, while the only ones available seemed either too spammy or did not have enough brand value. This ordeal ended when I finally aquired the domain from the godaddy auctions using the awesome chrome extension. Luckily I found this domain in a closeout auction and only had to pay an additional 10 dollars for it. In the future, I am just going to buy them off godaddy's closeout auctions instead of wasting hours trying to find the right one. Although NameCheap is my prefered registrar, I am quite happy having some domains over at GoDaddys. Now back to the main topic, where I tell you about the different types of clays. Types of Clay\nHave you ever wondered as to why objects that appear not to share any similarities or do not resemble each other even remotely are classified under the label of 'pottery'? The answer to this is quite simple - they have been made from different types of clay and hence are reflective of the traits of the particular variety or varieties. Types of clay that are commonly used for the purpose of pottery are -\n- Kaolin - Credit for having discovered and employed this type for making objects goes to the Chinese and this explains as to why it is also popularly referred to as China Clay. One of its most well known uses pertains to creation of porcelain objects which have earned China renown all over the world. - Bentonite - Best known for its plasticity, this variety is mostly used in combination with other less plastic varieties so as to render them more malleable. - Fire clay - Somewhat similar to Kaolin but characterized by a lower flux rate, fire clay is known for its resistance to heat despite the name 'fire'."", 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:7c423aee-5f59-45ff-9133-a3da1b83a46e>']}]","{

Groshek (or groszek) means \""polka dot\"" in Polish, which reflects the many beautiful spotty designs that Polish pottery is renowned for. What is Polish pottery? Every piece of Polish pottery is handmade and hand-decorated using stamps and brushes. It comes in hundreds of shapes, with patterns ranging from classic dots and \u201cpeacock eyes\u201d to more intricate \u201cartistic\u201d or \u201cUNIKAT\u201d patterns. My pottery comes from Zaklady Ceramiczne \u201cBoleslawiec\u201d, which is one of the biggest manufacturers in the region and whose tradition goes back to the 19th century. Caring for your pottery\nThe high quality of the clay combined with the manufacturing process make Polish pottery extremely durable. Fired at over 1200\u00b0C, it is classed as stoneware and safe to use in dishwashers, microwaves and fridges. This makes Polish pottery suitable for everyday use at home and in catering. All dishes with a grooved bottom are also safe to use in traditional gas or electric ovens up to 280\u00b0C, as well as on glass, ceramic and electric hobs."",

### Context: Learning patterns/Using drones for aerial photography for Commons and Wikipedia
What problem does this solve?Edit
With aerial photos taken via a drone you can present objects of encyclopedic relevance from a completely different perspective compared to conventional photography. Particularly in the case of cultural heritage properties or of nature conservation areas, e.g. during the annual photo contests ""Wiki Loves Monuments"" and ""Wiki Loves Earth"", such pictures can provide a significant added value. However, when dealing with a drone, in addition to some technical hurdles, you may face a jungle of regionally different legal requirements. What permits are required? What costs can be expected, what support options are available and what else is there to consider? What is the solution?Edit
What technical requirements are the minimum to take pictures by means of a drone?Edit
The drone should be GPS controlled so that it maintains its position in the air without manual countermeasures. The camera should have an appropriately high resolution. In Germany, Switzerland and Austria, volunteers can borrow a photo drone (owned by WMCH) through the joint technical pool of the Wikimedia chapters in these countries. Which legal requirements exist and how can they be met?Edit
Basically, anyone who wants to start a photo drone outside of private property (e.g. at the property of a model flying association) requires an appropriate liability insurance. Such insurance, for example, is included in the membership fee of the German model flying association (DMFV). If an additional insurance is required apart from this, depends on the particular model of the photo drone, and especially, on its weight. In Switzerland, each and every one who wants to fly a drone >500 grams and to take pictures with it, must have a liability insurance (liability coverage in the amount of at least CHF 1M). In Germany, you do not need special permission if photos are taken for private purposes only. Nevertheless, the agreement of the landowner must be obtained. And, of course, it is also not allowed to spy on your neighbors ;-)
In Sweden it is complex, but best practices have been collected by Wikimedia Sverige. If photos are taken for commercial use, a general permission for the rise of unmanned aviation systems must be obtained. You can apply for this e.g. at Rhineland-Palatinate’s (German federal state) state office for mobility, department for aviation, at the airport Frankfurt-Hahn. Additionally, the local police station and the town clerk's office should to be informed at least 48 hours before the rise of the drone. Not every federal state accepts a permission obtained in another federal state, so that, for example, a flight across the border from Rhineland-Palatinate federal state to Hesse federal state can be problematic. Of course, there is a certain disambiguity in the distinction between private and commercial purposes. Some may say the private purpose is limited to a private photo album, but does not cover publications in social networks or even Wikipedia. So, if you want to be 100% safe, before taking the photographs and publishing them on Commons you should organize the following things:
- liability insurance. - the permission of the local authorities. - the consent of the landowner. - notification at the local police and town clerk's office at least 48 hours before the drone is launched. What other costs arise aside the costs for the technical equipment?Edit
Liability insurance, including additional insurance for drones of up to 5 kg, costs 50–60 euros per year. The yearly permission fee for launching drones is 150–200 euros, which may be covered by the Wikimedia chapters in Germany, Switzerland and Austria on request. What practical tips and tricks are to be considered?Edit
Before actually taking aerial photos with a photo drone, it's useful to practice maneuvering the drone on a big field or meadow. It's very important to keep visual contact with the drone! Sometimes, this can be quite tricky, because you have to account for the alignment of the photographic frame at the same time. If you want to do that the best way possible, it is really helpful to have a second person on-side to watch the drone and warn of any dangers or occurrences. Where can I get more information and find competent contacts?Edit
In Germany, you can approach the Deutscher Modellflieger Verband (German model flying association), and there are many forums and pages in the social web where you can get more detailed information. On Youtube there are some really interesting and good tutorial videos by Arthur Konze.

Post new question
Does anyone use a drone here whenever you travel inside india? is it really necessary to take permission before flying a drone in rural or tourist places inside india? There are guidelines to use the Drone more than like 2Km , 5Km range as we used small drones for capturing pictures from around 200m ..400m so you can use with the normal permissions. Yes Local police or forest dept for some trek . Normal permission means the local police or the local tourism incharge? The one with higher frequency radius sure needs permission which is quite impossible to get. Drones are specifically not allowed in touristy places, try shooting gorilla and don’t get caught if you really need some drone shots. Check the below links:-
Hi, Actually, someplace have strict rules about flying a drone. You need to know them beforehand and if required take all necessary permission.s
Hey yes some of the places dont allow the drone flying & doing things better to take permissions there
Sandeep Kumar Chanda
You take permission if you don't want to face any issues or problem from them

At the end of the day, move the footage you’ve collected onto the tablet and use the external hard drive (or two) as your secondary backup. This protects the footage you have collected without worrying about access to WiFi or other services. Get a Remote Pilots Certificate from the FAA if you’ll be piloting your drone for commercial purposes, including monetized blogs and vlogs
By Paul from Travel is Life
If you’ll be posting your drone shots on a video channel or blog that is monetized (whether with ads, affiliate links, digital product sales, etc), you’re technically using your drone for commercial purposes, and you need a Remote Pilots Certificate from the FAA. The test costs $150 and takes a day of studying. I enjoyed the process because I learned information about air space regulations, weather patterns, and safety precautions that I would need to know anyway – even as a hobbyist. The fines are too big to risk not obtaining your certificate, and who knows… being commercially licensed might one day make the difference between you getting permission to fly your drone at a particular location and capture the shots you’re after. Places are getting more strict about drone operations every day, and it’s best to play by the rules when federal airspace is involved. Check to see if there is any sensitive or endangered wildlife in the area that you should avoid
By Cristina from Travel For Wildlife
When planning your flight take some time to research the area’s wildlife. Your flight shouldn’t approach resting, nesting, or feeding animals as drones can negatively affect wildlife. For example it can flush nesting birds, can cause resting seals to flee toward the water trampling others during their escape, and can dangerously raise the heart rate and stress level of bears. These are just some of the reasons that drones have been banned from National Parks and National Wildlife Refuges in the US. The ban carries a maximum penalty of a $5,000 fine and six months in jail. Other countries have different rules, and it is always important to check the rules for each country. In South Africa, a visitor was banned for life after other visitors reported him for flying a drone in Kruger National Park. If you visit a national park in South Africa and carry a drone, make sure to disclose it when you enter the park, as park officials will seal it until you leave. This might save you a hefty fee or ban for having an unsealed drone found in your car! Be careful not to disturb any wildlife
By Christa Rolls from Expedition Wildlife
Be cautious and conscientious about flying your drone near wildlife. Drones can be seen as a threat to wildlife, and animals will expend unnecessary resources to either defend their territory or flee somewhere they’ll feel protected from your drone. The best consideration is to pinpoint the wildlife present near your flight zone prior to take off, and as soon as their behavior changes in association with the drone’s presence, discontinue flying. Consider having a spotter, meaning one person watches the wildlife’s demeanor for any behavioral changes or stress, while the other operates the drone. This is not only for the wildlife’s safety, and the ethics consideration of flying drones near wildlife, but also for you and your drone’s well-being. A bird dive-bombing your drone can easily take it down, and likely injure the bird in the process, as well as leave you liable for wildlife harassment charges. Make best use of your incredible footage
By Bradley from Dream Big, Travel Far
With so much effort spent capturing your drone footage, my top tip would be to ensure you have a plan in place to make best use of it. Simply put you have 2 choices. Either you learn how to edit video footage yourself or you hire someone who knows how to. Making breathtaking travel videos are the ultimate reminder of your time abroad. So failing to make use of it is almost a sin! Personally, we are in the process of following both of these options. We have a friend who is great at video editing, and is currently working through our footage in Sri Lanka to make some tantalizing travel videos. At the same time, we have downloaded Adobe Premiere Elements and are busy learning and practicing our skills. Hopefully these tips have prepared you for your first trip with your drone. Feel free to add any other tips for traveling with a drone in the comments below.

Since a minimum of bigger drones are comparable to other air traficants, they are obliged to keep lanterns and different means to warn towards the possibility for collision, however since government instances operating drones typically want to keep the flight secret, such lanterns will probably be lit solely when different site (www.lucamauri.net) visitors is in the neighbourhood, or when the operators need visual contact. This type of intermittent gentle emission is typical of many classical UFO sightings. Additionally the flight pattern of a drone which are used for surveillance and investigation will mimic the pattern seen by objects in UFO reviews: Typically they fly foreword with numerous velocity, sometimes they cease and simply hover, they’ll often change course, they’ll come from above, do some maneuvers close to the bottom and then fly up and away. Also lights from drones can be utilized to illuminate targets, typically at the bottom, for picture recording, which can be seen in classical UFO tales. Also many drones have a shape like a classical UFO. Furthermore, drones will make only little noise, which also is characteristic of so-called UFOs. These 4k drones have superior options resembling precision stabilization along with autonomous flight modes such as observe me, orbit, waypoints and lively tracking to make filming easier. There are also numerous 4k drones with obstacle detection and collision avoidance. 4k video recording cameras on drones is changing into the usual entry point for professional aerial filming. In 2016, we began to see the primary of the 4k drone cameras coming to the market. A drone is an unmanned remotely managed flying car that additionally can be utilized for specific work as well as to just with the ability to fly around. Drones are used for photographic and video recording from above. Some are used to carry out scientific or technical measurements. Some carry weapons and are used as combat tools. Now you may have all the pictures of your photographic journey loaded into Lightroom, this article provides you a step-by-step guide. This program is intuitive when it comes to stitching these photographs collectively, however will want somewhat tweaking utilizing the panorama merge preview.

DRONES: A BIRDS EYE VIEW
By Sandip Pratihar
Image (above) from “Gorchlach: The Legend of Cordielia”
“I think technologies are growing massively in the world. Drones included. Where humans can’t reach drones can. But there is always the question of privacy. In some countries the use of drones is banned. So I think drone technology is good where it pertains to cinema and other creative applications; but the possibility for missuse is always a consideration.”
A drone is a simply an aircraft – relatively small – piloted either autonomously by on-board computers or by a remote control on the ground. Drones have been used for military and special operation applications in recent history, but modern technology has allowed companies to manufacturer commercial versions for consumer use. In this guide, we will discuss how to do aerial photography with drones for consumers. The origin of the drone occurred towards the end of world war one, The US army were designing aerial torpedo’s, which were small planes that were used like the Kamikaze and slammed into their target. The war ended before they could be used. In 1939, in the very early stage of world war two, The United States produced the first remote controlled aircraft called the Radio plane 00-2. Norma Jeane, before she became better known as Marilyn Monroe, worked at the California plant, where she worked on the assembly of the Radio plane 00-2 during the war. Unmanned surveillance operations continued to play a more prominent role in the Cold War and global conflict in general. In 1973, Israel developed the AI scout, which were unmanned surveillance machines in the sky. In 1986, the US and Israel came together to produce the RQ2 Pioneer; a medium seize reconnaissance drone. IN 1990, American defense contractor General Atomics, bought an Israel engineer to design and create the Gnat 7050 drone concept, which would later become the Predator Drone we know today. In 2014, Amazon announced proposals to use drones much smaller and simpler than those used in the military to deliver packages to customers. Real estate agencies have begun using drones for promotional videos and taken pictures from the sky of high end properties in their marketing. Small and medium size companies have started creating their own small-scale machines for recreational purposes, which have proved very popular in sports such as surfing and skiing, where the small device simply follows the subject with the help of a GPS tracker on their wrist. Others uses of drones are for anti-poaching rescue missions in Africa. Medical delivery by drones in remote places temporally cut off from the outside world is still in testing phase at the moment. Technically there is no difference between drones and helicopters. That’s because they are not mutually exclusive things. See, a drone could be made in the form of a helicopter, an airplane, or even a balloon. A drone is just a popular term for any unmanned aerial vehicle. So, by popular terminology, any vehicle that flies and doesn’t have a pilot inside the cockpit manually steering it would be a drone. It could be controlled by a human via a remote or by pre-programmed computer software. So if we were to just look at the term drone, then that can really be used to mean any unmanned vehicle operated either through software or the use of a remote pilot. A drone can be made in the shape of an airplane, a helicopter, a quadcopter, or even submarine for that matter. So in short, there is no difference between a helicopter and a drone. Drones can be made in any shape or size, it just means that it is a moving vehicle of some kind without a pilot inside the craft, but when most people mention a drone today, they are typically speaking about quadcopter designs. Smaller cameras, drones and technology that smooths out wobbly camerawork are some of the gadgets that are allowing film-makers to go to places they could not previously reach. In the old days, cameramen used to have the camera on their shoulder and run after someone or something, which looked a bit bumpy, now we can make it look absolutely smooth. The technology’s getting smaller and smaller, which allows you to take really good shots but get into more nooks and crannies than you ever could before. That’s the real, dramatic change.

In the past, provided you weren’t within a few miles of a major airport or military base you could rely on few problems. But recently, no-fly zones have begun to sprout up all over the landscape. More and more urban areas and national parks have begun to enforce these zones (enforced via locational ‘geo-fencing’ software I might add, rather than the more exciting prospects of miniaturized air-aircraft batteries or dogfights with specially trained albatrosses), so it’s important to check before setting out to avoid disappointment. Just because you’ve flown there before doesn’t mean things will still be the same, for example, the city where we are now based has changed its no fly zones at least 3 times in the past year, going from a free for all, to a complete ban, to now restricted flying zones just around the city centre and the university campus. You can usually find updated maps online, or through your drone software. So check carefully, and as close as possible to the time of your visit. Plan your drone locations and shots beforehand
By Charmaine from LuvMiHome.com
Make a list of the drone locations you are interested in beforehand. You can use tools such as Google earth to scout your locations and find interesting angles. This will give you an idea of what your location looks like from the air as well as the ground. You will also need to consider what altitude works best for your location. Don’t be afraid to try different altitudes and angles of your target to get the best possible shot. Lighting is an important factor; you will need to figure out the direction of the light during different times of the day and select the appropriate time. Lastly make sure you fly your drone in good weather; snow, rain and wind can be a menace to your drone. Be wary or avoid flying over crowds
By Lexi from A Scenic Find
I’ve seen a few drop out of the sky (mine included), so I’m always super careful about where I fly them. The best places to fly them are in open fields, beaches or anywhere where crowds are sparse. It’s so easy to think of them as toys, but they can and do malfunction mid flight occasionally. I’ve had one of mine drop out of the sky into a lake due to a technical error, since then I’ve always been super strict about where I fly if there are crowds around. Flying with LiPo batteries and keeping them safe
By Manon from Visiting the Dutch Countryside
If you’re traveling with your drone you, most likely, need to pack LiPo batteries. You can only take LiPo batteries with you in your hand luggage and airlines won’t allow you to check them. LiPo batteries can combust, so you have to do everything you can prevent this. Cover the battery terminals with gaffer’s tape and place the batteries inside a fireproof, special LiPo battery, bag. Don’t forget to drain the batteries before you’re headed to the airport. You need to check with your airlines how many LiPo batteries you are allowed to take. Keeping drone batteries warm in the winter
By Manon from Visiting the Dutch Countryside
When you want to use your drone in cold temperatures, or when you’re traveling through cold temperatures, you need to keep the batteries warm. One way of keeping the batteries warm is keeping them in a warm pocket. The batteries drain quick in cold temperatures. So if you can place them close to your body that would be perfect. You can also put the batteries in a sock, which is a better option if you have the batteries in a case. The absolute best place to warm them is close to your body. For instance, wear a sweater with pockets and put a few batteries inside the pockets. Drone footage storage while traveling
By Christa from Expedition Wildlife
Make sure you have a plan to back up your video footage during your travels. There are multiple ways you can ensure the drone videos you’ve taken don’t get lost or damaged – this can include transferring everything onto an external hard drive or onto a cloud account. Also consider keeping multiple memory cards handy to switch out in the event that you need more storage space or don’t want to have all of your hard work on one card alone. We recommend purchasing a tablet, or other lightweight and easily packable device, and an external hard drive to use as a storage space and transfer mechanism for your footage.

Although there have been many sorts of technology that have changed the way that we think about our world, it’s easy to see how drones have been something that have had a tremendous impact. With the help of a great drone, you’re going to discover that there are all kinds of ways that you can see the world entirely differently than before. With drones becoming more and more easy to operate, there are all sorts of great things that can be done with them that people might not have imagined in the past. With all of the new drones that are entering the market, you’ll find that there are a lot of new uses for drones out there in the world. For those who are hoping to make better use of any drones that are available in your area, it can be a challenge to understand where they can be most useful. You can use the following guide to learn more about what many companies are choosing to do with their access to all kinds of aerial photography. You’ll tend to find that many companies are choosing to work with aerial filming crews to help them survey land. You’re going to find that there are many reasons why you’ll need to engage in some high-quality surveying before you begin any sort of construction project. Even though construction services have been relying on ground surveying technology for decades when making plans, you’ll tend to find that it can really be a better idea to use an aerial view to make the right choices for your building. If you can hire an aerial survey crew to help you analyze the land you have, it should be easy to make better decisions. What Do You Know About Drones
You may also want to look to drones to help with aerial mapping in Dubai. You’ll find that drones that are taking pictures and filming from overhead will give you an accurate sense of the land in ways that ground-level mapping won’t be able to do. No matter what sort of scale you’re hoping to map, you’ll find that there are a number of great advantages out there when it comes to working with drones. A Quick Rundown of Reviews
There is no question that drones will be something that will allow you to be able to see more of the world. What you’ll find is that a good drone operator is going to make it possible to learn a lot more about our world.

Eventually the security manager will go onto the roof, put the drone back in the box where it can charge, and close the lid. There will be liability and legality questions to work out. There will be installation and deployment challenges to work out. But yes, I think many commercial sites with large parking lots, campuses, or generally just having lots of horizontal space will eventually have little boxes on their roof that launch an autonomous drone for live satelite-style surveillance when needed. Ryan, I agree with you. Whether private business or law enforcement they will play a large role in the future. Drones can be dispatched to any number of crimes in progress via gps, they will not only get there faster than anything on wheels but also faster than helicopters and at a fraction of the cost. Has anyone used a drone yet to get pictures of a site for use in designing a CCTV system? You can always use Google maps, but they may be out of date, wrong season, watermarked, or low res. I saw today how easy it is to get high resolution images of a site with a ""low cost"" drone, nd was wondering if anyone out there has found a business model where it can be utilized. As a side note, I heard that if you charge for the specific services of the drone, you need a commercial pilot license, thus you are charging for other services, and the drone use is ""free""...
Hi Aaron, I haven't used drones but I also wonder about blimps (i.e. helium balloons). I've seen real estate agents use them to get take aerial property photos and I could imagine they might also be very good for taking low cost aerial photos of a site. Companies who advertise photographic blimp services claim blimps can be used in locations where drones are not allowed, e.g. near airports. I don't know whether a license is required for blimps but wouldn't be surprised if the requirements were less for a blimp. I also suspect the hardware and running costs would be cheaper. Maybe another member has some solid information on licensing and purchase prices and running costs of drones vs blimps.

Arizona Drone Photography has been used to produce stunning pictures of landscapes, rock formations, city lights, sunsets, and many other beautiful images. What most people do not realize is that they can have Aerial Photography Arizona taken for their personal or commercial purposes and events. The cost is affordable, the resolution is high, and pictures can be taken at different angles and heights. Imagine seeing that dream outdoor wedding from an altitude of up to four-hundred feet, or as close as five meters. The setting, the happy couple, the bridal party, flowers, and guests can all be captured in one frame. The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), more commonly known as drones, operate with low noise levels, so there will be no interruption of speeches, toasts, and music. People spend a lot of time and money planning for their big day, so having special pictures of the event will be a great way to remember it for years into the future.

Particularly in the case of cultural heritage properties or of nature conservation areas, e.g. during the annual photo contests ""Wiki Loves Monuments"" and ""Wiki Loves Earth"", such pictures can provide a significant added value. However, when dealing with a drone, in addition to some technical hurdles, you may face a jungle of regionally different legal requirements. What permits are required? What costs can be expected, what support options are available and what else is there to consider? What is the solution?Edit\nWhat technical requirements are the minimum to take pictures by means of a drone?Edit\nThe drone should be GPS controlled so that it maintains its position in the air without manual countermeasures. The camera should have an appropriately high resolution. In Germany, Switzerland and Austria, volunteers can borrow a photo drone (owned by WMCH) through the joint technical pool of the Wikimedia chapters in these countries. Which legal requirements exist and how can they be met?Edit\nBasically, anyone who wants to start a photo drone outside of private property (e.g. at the property of a model flying association) requires an appropriate liability insurance. Such insurance, for example, is included in the membership fee of the German model flying association (DMFV). If an additional insurance is required apart from this, depends on the particular model of the photo drone, and especially, on its weight. In Switzerland, each and every one who wants to fly a drone >500 grams and to take pictures with it, must have a liability insurance (liability coverage in the amount of at least CHF 1M). In Germany, you do not need special permission if photos are taken for private purposes only. Nevertheless, the agreement of the landowner must be obtained. And, of course, it is also not allowed to spy on your neighbors ;-)\nIn Sweden it is complex, but best practices have been collected by Wikimedia Sverige. If photos are taken for commercial use, a general permission for the rise of unmanned aviation systems must be obtained. You can apply for this e.g. at Rhineland-Palatinate’s (German federal state) state office for mobility, department for aviation, at the airport Frankfurt-Hahn. Additionally, the local police station and the town clerk\'s office should to be informed at least 48 hours before the rise of the drone. Not every federal state accepts a permission obtained in another federal state, so that, for example, a flight across the border from Rhineland-Palatinate federal state to Hesse federal state can be problematic. Of course, there is a certain disambiguity in the distinction between private and commercial purposes. Some may say the private purpose is limited to a private photo album, but does not cover publications in social networks or even Wikipedia. So, if you want to be 100% safe, before taking the photographs and publishing them on Commons you should organize the following things:\n- liability insurance. - the permission of the local authorities. - the consent of the landowner. - notification at the local police and town clerk\'s office at least 48 hours before the drone is launched. What other costs arise aside the costs for the technical equipment?Edit\nLiability insurance, including additional insurance for drones of up to 5 kg, costs 50–60 euros per year. The yearly permission fee for launching drones is 150–200 euros, which may be covered by the Wikimedia chapters in Germany, Switzerland and Austria on request. What practical tips and tricks are to be considered?Edit\nBefore actually taking aerial photos with a photo drone, it\'s useful to practice maneuvering the drone on a big field or meadow. It\'s very important to keep visual contact with the drone! Sometimes, this can be quite tricky, because you have to account for the alignment of the photographic frame at the same time. If you want to do that the best way possible, it is really helpful to have a second person on-side to watch the drone and warn of any dangers or occurrences. Where can I get more information and find competent contacts?Edit\nIn Germany, you can approach the Deutscher Modellflieger Verband (German model flying association), and there are many forums and pages in the social web where you can get more detailed information. On Youtube there are some really interesting and good tutorial videos by Arthur Konze.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:b3a98f57-223f-475d-b028-84c419129d22>']}, {'passage': ""Post new question\nDoes anyone use a drone here whenever you travel inside india? is it really necessary to take permission before flying a drone in rural or tourist places inside india?

Get a Remote Pilots Certificate from the FAA if you’ll be piloting your drone for commercial purposes, including monetized blogs and vlogs\nBy Paul from Travel is Life\nIf you’ll be posting your drone shots on a video channel or blog that is monetized (whether with ads, affiliate links, digital product sales, etc), you’re technically using your drone for commercial purposes, and you need a Remote Pilots Certificate from the FAA. The test costs $150 and takes a day of studying. I enjoyed the process because I learned information about air space regulations, weather patterns, and safety precautions that I would need to know anyway – even as a hobbyist. The fines are too big to risk not obtaining your certificate, and who knows… being commercially licensed might one day make the difference between you getting permission to fly your drone at a particular location and capture the shots you’re after. Places are getting more strict about drone operations every day, and it’s best to play by the rules when federal airspace is involved. Check to see if there is any sensitive or endangered wildlife in the area that you should avoid\nBy Cristina from Travel For Wildlife\nWhen planning your flight take some time to research the area’s wildlife. Your flight shouldn’t approach resting, nesting, or feeding animals as drones can negatively affect wildlife. For example it can flush nesting birds, can cause resting seals to flee toward the water trampling others during their escape, and can dangerously raise the heart rate and stress level of bears. These are just some of the reasons that drones have been banned from National Parks and National Wildlife Refuges in the US. The ban carries a maximum penalty of a $5,000 fine and six months in jail. Other countries have different rules, and it is always important to check the rules for each country. In South Africa, a visitor was banned for life after other visitors reported him for flying a drone in Kruger National Park. If you visit a national park in South Africa and carry a drone, make sure to disclose it when you enter the park, as park officials will seal it until you leave. This might save you a hefty fee or ban for having an unsealed drone found in your car! Be careful not to disturb any wildlife\nBy Christa Rolls from Expedition Wildlife\nBe cautious and conscientious about flying your drone near wildlife. Drones can be seen as a threat to wildlife, and animals will expend unnecessary resources to either defend their territory or flee somewhere they’ll feel protected from your drone. The best consideration is to pinpoint the wildlife present near your flight zone prior to take off, and as soon as their behavior changes in association with the drone’s presence, discontinue flying. Consider having a spotter, meaning one person watches the wildlife’s demeanor for any behavioral changes or stress, while the other operates the drone. This is not only for the wildlife’s safety, and the ethics consideration of flying drones near wildlife, but also for you and your drone’s well-being. A bird dive-bombing your drone can easily take it down, and likely injure the bird in the process, as well as leave you liable for wildlife harassment charges.

Drones included. Where humans can’t reach drones can. But there is always the question of privacy. In some countries the use of drones is banned. So I think drone technology is good where it pertains to cinema and other creative applications; but the possibility for missuse is always a consideration.”\nA drone is a simply an aircraft – relatively small – piloted either autonomously by on-board computers or by a remote control on the ground. Drones have been used for military and special operation applications in recent history, but modern technology has allowed companies to manufacturer commercial versions for consumer use. In this guide, we will discuss how to do aerial photography with drones for consumers. The origin of the drone occurred towards the end of world war one, The US army were designing aerial torpedo’s, which were small planes that were used like the Kamikaze and slammed into their target. The war ended before they could be used. In 1939, in the very early stage of world war two, The United States produced the first remote controlled aircraft called the Radio plane 00-2. Norma Jeane, before she became better known as Marilyn Monroe, worked at the California plant, where she worked on the assembly of the Radio plane 00-2 during the war. Unmanned surveillance operations continued to play a more prominent role in the Cold War and global conflict in general. In 1973, Israel developed the AI scout, which were unmanned surveillance machines in the sky. In 1986, the US and Israel came together to produce the RQ2 Pioneer; a medium seize reconnaissance drone. IN 1990, American defense contractor General Atomics, bought an Israel engineer to design and create the Gnat 7050 drone concept, which would later become the Predator Drone we know today. In 2014, Amazon announced proposals to use drones much smaller and simpler than those used in the military to deliver packages to customers. Real estate agencies have begun using drones for promotional videos and taken pictures from the sky of high end properties in their marketing. Small and medium size companies have started creating their own small-scale machines for recreational purposes, which have proved very popular in sports such as surfing and skiing, where the small device simply follows the subject with the help of a GPS tracker on their wrist. Others uses of drones are for anti-poaching rescue missions in Africa. Medical delivery by drones in remote places temporally cut off from the outside world is still in testing phase at the moment. Technically there is no difference between drones and helicopters. That’s because they are not mutually exclusive things. See, a drone could be made in the form of a helicopter, an airplane, or even a balloon. A drone is just a popular term for any unmanned aerial vehicle. So, by popular terminology, any vehicle that flies and doesn’t have a pilot inside the cockpit manually steering it would be a drone. It could be controlled by a human via a remote or by pre-programmed computer software. So if we were to just look at the term drone, then that can really be used to mean any unmanned vehicle operated either through software or the use of a remote pilot. A drone can be made in the shape of an airplane, a helicopter, a quadcopter, or even submarine for that matter. So in short, there is no difference between a helicopter and a drone. Drones can be made in any shape or size, it just means that it is a moving vehicle of some kind without a pilot inside the craft, but when most people mention a drone today, they are typically speaking about quadcopter designs. Smaller cameras, drones and technology that smooths out wobbly camerawork are some of the gadgets that are allowing film-makers to go to places they could not previously reach. In the old days, cameramen used to have the camera on their shoulder and run after someone or something, which looked a bit bumpy, now we can make it look absolutely smooth. The technology’s getting smaller and smaller, which allows you to take really good shots but get into more nooks and crannies than you ever could before. That’s the real, dramatic change.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:c64ed67f-9186-464d-9d83-fed872aeed89>']}, {'passage': 'In the past, provided you weren’t within a few miles of a major airport or military base you could rely on few problems. But recently, no-fly zones have begun to sprout up all over the landscape. More and more urban areas and national parks have begun to enforce these zones (enforced via locational ‘geo-fencing’ software I might add, rather than the more exciting prospects of miniaturized air-aircraft batteries or dogfights with specially trained albatrosses), so it’s important to check before setting out to avoid disappointment. Just because you’ve flown there before doesn’t mean things will still be the same, for example, the city where we are now based has changed its no fly zones at least 3 times in the past year, going from a free for all, to a complete ban, to now restricted flying zones just around the city centre and the university campus. You can usually find updated maps online, or through your drone software. So check carefully, and as close as possible to the time of your visit. Plan your drone locations and shots beforehand\nBy Charmaine from LuvMiHome.com\nMake a list of the drone locations you are interested in beforehand. You can use tools such as Google earth to scout your locations and find interesting angles. This will give you an idea of what your location looks like from the air as well as the ground. You will also need to consider what altitude works best for your location. Don’t be afraid to try different altitudes and angles of your target to get the best possible shot. Lighting is an important factor; you will need to figure out the direction of the light during different times of the day and select the appropriate time. Lastly make sure you fly your drone in good weather; snow, rain and wind can be a menace to your drone. Be wary or avoid flying over crowds\nBy Lexi from A Scenic Find\nI’ve seen a few drop out of the sky (mine included), so I’m always super careful about where I fly them. The best places to fly them are in open fields, beaches or anywhere where crowds are sparse. It’s so easy to think of them as toys, but they can and do malfunction mid flight occasionally. I’ve had one of mine drop out of the sky into a lake due to a technical error, since then I’ve always been super strict about where I fly if there are crowds around. Flying with LiPo batteries and keeping them safe\nBy Manon from Visiting the Dutch Countryside\nIf you’re traveling with your drone you, most likely, need to pack LiPo batteries. You can only take LiPo batteries with you in your hand luggage and airlines won’t allow you to check them. LiPo batteries can combust, so you have to do everything you can prevent this. Cover the battery terminals with gaffer’s tape and place the batteries inside a fireproof, special LiPo battery, bag. Don’t forget to drain the batteries before you’re headed to the airport. You need to check with your airlines how many LiPo batteries you are allowed to take. Keeping drone batteries warm in the winter\nBy Manon from Visiting the Dutch Countryside\nWhen you want to use your drone in cold temperatures, or when you’re traveling through cold temperatures, you need to keep the batteries warm. One way of keeping the batteries warm is keeping them in a warm pocket. The batteries drain quick in cold temperatures. So if you can place them close to your body that would be perfect. You can also put the batteries in a sock, which is a better option if you have the batteries in a case. The absolute best place to warm them is close to your body. For instance, wear a sweater with pockets and put a few batteries inside the pockets. Drone footage storage while traveling\nBy Christa from Expedition Wildlife\nMake sure you have a plan to back up your video footage during your travels. There are multiple ways you can ensure the drone videos you’ve taken don’t get lost or damaged – this can include transferring everything onto an external hard drive or onto a cloud account. Also consider keeping multiple memory cards handy to switch out in the event that you need more storage space or don’t want to have all of your hard work on one card alone.

                ""text"": ""Drone Photography \u2013 Your Wedding Photographer Needs To Click These! What is drone photography? Drone photography is the capture of still images and video by a remotely-operated, unmanned aerial vehicle, also known as an unmanned aircraft system or more commonly, a drone. In other words, drone photography is clicking pictures with a flying camera that is up in the air, handled by a remote control. Yeah, so basically it is getting aerial shots from reeaaallly high vantage points to get a larger (read cooler) view of the object/person that is being photographed. They can give you a 360 view of everything in the frame. How awesome is that? Why should you ask your photographer to click them? Well, why not?! A complete, 360 view of you and your wedding? Hell, I\u2019d like some for myself, but I\u2019m not getting married soon and a random drone shoot would be an awful waste of money. But since you\u2019re probably reading this because you\u2019re getting married \u2013 your wedding photographer most likely uses drones already (almost every good photographer is equipped with them) so you could specifically let them know that you\u2019d like a few good drone photographs. It\u2019s a whole new way to document the memory of your wedding. They\u2019re used widely in pre-wedding shoots as well. And actually they work better for pre-wedding shoots! The aerial shots, the larger-than-life view.. love how they capture you, your fianc\u00e9 and all the scenic surroundings as well. Check out how brilliant these drone photography pre-wedding photos are:\nSo guys, would you use drone photography at your wedding? If you do, send us your picture and we\u2019ll be happy to post it! <3"",

I\u2019ve been fascinated by viewing the United States through his eyes from photos taken decades ago and now have enjoyed the journey of finding the same locations to see for myself. I hope you come back and check out the progression of the Vintage America project every Friday! Work began on the Crazy Horse Memorial in 1948 and, once completed, it will be the largest sculpture in the world. In the foreground is a model of what the planned Memorial will eventually look like\u2026so while I was amazed at the detail of the face of Crazy Horse, I was also shocked at really how much of the sculpture had yet to be completed. Since the time of my grandfather\u2019s photograph, Crazy Horse has also gained popularity as a must-see tourist attraction, hence the extended observation deck and Visitor Center addition behind the model statue. As I was waiting for the optimal time to capture the same image my grandfather had, it was particularly satisfying to have conversations with people regarding my project and see their excitement about it. One older woman even asked to take a picture of me holding my grandfather\u2019s photo! All throughout my trip I came across people who were genuinely excited about my mission, which further confirmed that the venture I\u2019m undertaking is a worthwhile endeavor. I hope that all of you feel the same and that you\u2019ll continue to follow and support the project! Don\u2019t miss any future Vintage America posts, subscribe for email updates!"",

                ""text"": ""What are Photo Flights and why not use a drone? A photo flight is a flight in a helicopter or airplane with a photographer on board, taking pictures of properties, events, construction sites or other projects. So why not just use a drone? That seems to be just so much easier, right? Well, a drone is very lightweight, and can stay in the air only for a limited amount of time. Winds can be challenging for a drone because of its weight. There are also restrictions on what you can do with a drone. You cannot operate above a certain altitude without FAA approval, and you cannot operate close to certain airports. A helicopter or airplane is able to stay in the air for hours, if needed. An aircraft can cover a way bigger area and give the photographer better flexibility. There are specific applications where a drone makes way more sense than a helicopter or airplane. Especially if you are operating close to the ground. So both have their advantages and disadvantages. How does a photo flight typically work? We typically start with a ground briefing with the photographer and the pilot. This is to make sure both know exactly what is expected and what is of importance to the photographer or camera man and the project. This is of even more importance if a video or movie is shot. It will help keep the cost down, since we want to keep the time that we are in the helicopter actually flying as focused and short as possible. Also important is the safety briefing. No loose objects in the aircraft. We try to fulfill the needs of the photographer but it is of the highest importance that the flight is safe. What projects have we done in the past? We have worked on film and photo projects including Music Videos, Vehicle promotion videos and lots of photography projects. Some of those include Vineyards, buildings, marathons, crop fields, construction sites and more. If you have any questions or need details on how we can help you with a certain project, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact us."",

Using drones to capture once (or twice?) in a lifetime wedding is becoming the techy trend these days, taking wedding video and photography to the next level. We are not talking about those drones used to capture and patrol war zones \u2014 but rather the small multi rotor UAV\u2019s controlled by an expert pilot from the ground remotely. Many videographers and photographers are adding aerial video and photography to their services after seeing drones being used in real estate and properties, because unlike the typical and traditional wedding photos and videos that uses tripods, cameras and ground videos, UAV\u2019s and drones provide a unique and complementary perspective. Drones provide some of the most dramatic images of the day.It can capture close-ups, bird\u2019s eye view, still images and flyover video footage in all angles and with different effects. What drones can do for your wedding\n- Capture aerial still shots of your wedding and record the ceremony from different viewpoints and angles. - Create a very unique video with an aerial flyover shots, perfect for outdoor weddings and events held in a beautiful setting. - Drones are perfect for landscapes, resort properties and any outdoor venue to capture more dramatic images and give perspective to the location. Aerial video and photography is unique but it can be more expensive than other photography due to equipment cost and dual operators (a pilot and gimbal operator). Careful planning is important to make sure that the actual shoot will go smoothly and of course, is safe. Drones should be operated and controlled by an expert pilot, have liability insurance, and follow best practices such as not flying over people. It can add some costs, but the result is an amazing and a dramatic interpretation of your special day! Aside from weddings, aerial video and photography can also be great for capturing other special occasions and events such as family reunions, birthday parties, school and corporate events."",

Making up a significant part of the world economy, the service sector is a rapidly evolving field that is relied on to dictate the public's satisfaction and success in various areas of everyday life, from banking and communications to education and healthcare. Service Science provides managers and students of the service industries with the quantitative skills necessary to model key decisions and performance metrics associated with services, including the management of resources, distribution of goods and services to customers, and the analysis and design of queueing systems.
The book begins with a brief introduction to the service sector followed by an introduction to optimization and queueing modeling, providing the methodological background needed to analyze service systems. Subsequent chapters present specific topics within service operations management, including:
- Location modeling and districting
- Resource allocation problems
- Short- and long-term workforce management
- Priority services, call center design, and customer scheduling
- Inventory modeling
- Vehicle routing
The author's own specialized software packages for location modeling, network optimization, and time-dependent queueing are utilized throughout the book, showing readers how to solve a variety of problems associated with service industries. These programs are freely available on the book's related web site along with detailed appendices and online spreadsheets that accompany the book's ""How to Do It in Excel"" sections, allowing readers to work hands-on with the presented techniques.
Extensively class-tested to ensure a comprehensive presentation, Service Science is an excellent book for industrial engineering and management courses on service operations at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. The book also serves as a reference for researchers in the fields of business, management science, operations research, engineering, and economics.
This book was named the 2010 Joint Publishers Book of the Year by the Institute of Industrial Engineers.

For businesses dealing with uncertain demand and lead times, there are specific models available. The newsvendor problem approach is particularly useful when dealing with perishable items or services with time-sensitive demand.","Managing inventory for a service business can be a bit different compared to a product-based business, as the focus is on managing resources and assets that support the delivery of services rather than physical products. However, effective inventory management is still crucial to ensure smooth operations, meet customer demands, and optimize costs. Here are some strategies for managing inventory in a service business:

1. **Identify Key Resources**: Understand what resources are essential for your service delivery. This can include materials, equipment, tools, and even human resources.

2. **Implement a Resource Tracking System**: Use software or manual systems to track the availability and usage of resources. This helps in identifying when resources are running low and need to be replenished.

3. **Prevent Over-Provisioning**: Just like in product-based businesses, over-provisioning resources can lead to unnecessary costs. Evaluate your resource needs based on service demand and historical data to avoid overstocking.

4. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Service demands can fluctuate, so it's important to regularly review your inventory levels and adjust as necessary. This might involve increasing or decreasing the availability of certain resources based on service trends.

5. **Implement Preventive Maintenance**: For equipment and tools, regular maintenance can prevent breakdowns and extend the life of your assets. This can reduce the need for frequent replacements and lower overall costs.

6. **Optimize Supplier Relationships**: Develop strong relationships with suppliers to ensure reliable delivery of resources. This might include negotiating better terms, establishing preferred supplier agreements, or creating a buffer stock to mitigate supply chain disruptions.

7. **Cross-Training Staff**: Having a flexible workforce can help manage fluctuations in demand. Cross-training staff can ensure that you have the necessary human resources available to deliver services efficiently.

8. **Leverage Technology**: Use technology to automate inventory management processes. Inventory management software can help track resource usage, automate reordering, and provide real-time data for better decision-making.

9. **Monitor Performance Metrics**: Keep track of key performance indicators (KPIs) related to your inventory management, such as resource utilization rates, inventory turnover, and lead times. These metrics can help you identify areas for improvement.

10. **Continuous Improvement**: Inventory management is an ongoing process. Regularly assess your strategies and make adjustments as needed to improve efficiency and effectiveness.

By focusing on these strategies, a service business can manage its inventory more effectively, leading to improved service delivery, reduced costs, and increased customer satisfaction.","You are a helpful assistant.

### Context: Inventory is usually the biggest cash investment a business makes every year and if you do not have an inventory policy, then that cash investment has no approval process. If you are overstocked, have high levels of slow moving stock or obsolete stock, then you have invested cash without approval and you do not have an effective inventory policy. You wouldn’t let any other significant expenditure be made without a detailed approval process, so why inventory? Here are a few points on how to manage your inventory effectively. Make to Order (MTO) vs. Make to Stock (MTS)
If you are a manufacturing business then you should be carefully analysing the MTO and MTS. You should assess the frequency, value and volume of each product and then overlay this information with the commercial strategy. If a product is sold infrequently, generates low returns, and does not form part of a wider commercial offering, then it should not be MTS. In fact, it should probably be delisted altogether. It doesn’t make sense to invest your cash in all products equally. Isn’t it better to have more stock, and consequently a better service level, for those products that generate the most sales and the most revenue? This is the purpose of an ABC classification. An ABC classification, sometimes called ‘runners, repeaters, strangers’, is an opportunity to focus cash, and improved service levels, at the products that are critically important to your business. Broadly speaking your inventory targets should be comprised of two components, cycle stock and safety stock. Cycle stock is straightforward – it is the mean expected demand during the replenishment lead time. Safety stock is more complex, and often overlooked. Safety stock is a probability assessment of demand exceeding the mean during the replenishment lead time, combined with the probability of delays in the replenishment lead time. This should be properly calculated – rules of thumb do not work and will leave you with too little or too much stock. Devising an inventory policy is not a one-off exercise. As your business profile changes, new products will come in, old products will go out and sales will increase and decrease. These factors will impact your inventory targets and consequently you should be making revisions to your MTO/MTS, portfolio classification and inventory targets periodically. If you do not have inventory management software then simple models can be developed in MS Excel to achieve this. Developing an inventory policy is not just about the known numbers; it is not purely an analytical exercise. You need to ensure that the analysis is overlaid with the expectations of the product life cycle, market promotions, sales strategies and commercial forecasts. It is important that there is cross-functional consensus from the commercial, finance and operations teams on the levels of inventory being targeted. Once you have an inventory policy established and a process for periodic review, then you should be looking at levers on how you can work to reduce stock. There are a number of methods you can use, but typically businesses should focus on:
- Modifying service levels (reducing service against ‘B’ & ‘C’ class items);
- Increasing MTO;
- Introducing minimum order quantities (MOQs) for customers;
- Negotiating higher frequency, lower volume deliveries with suppliers;
- Rationalising the portfolio;
- Improving forecasting and considering implementing Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP).

Plus, as with any task where humans are involved, the risk of human error is potentially high, particularly if employees feel rushed to complete the process as quickly as possible to keep labor costs down. It’s also difficult to locate the source of any mismatched numbers in a periodic system because so much time passes between counts that it’s hard to know when and where the numbers became off. Smaller organizations tend to benefit more from periodic systems because the cost involved are more manageable with less inventory and fewer labor hours to consider. Perpetual inventory control systems take a different approach. Instead of only tracking inventory at periodic intervals, you track each item throughout its journey across your facility. From the moment you receive it, to the moment it is used in your operations, sold, or scrapped, it’s tracked. You get up-to-the-minute data on precisely where your items are and what they’re being used for. This data is gathered from sensors, barcodes, and scanners that keep tabs on items in real time, helping to eliminate errors from miscounts and helping your team pull inventory items more efficiently. The moment out-of-stock items are received and allocated to the proper bin, your team can be notified and begin using them immediately, instead of sitting on the shelf waiting for the next cycle count. The challenges of perpetual systems are different that those for periodic systems. Instead of needing large amounts of labor to perform counts, you need to invest money upfront in the sensors, barcodes, scanners, software, and other technology that helps you collect your data. And the more locations you have, the more equipment you need to buy. You’ll still need to perform cycle counts periodically to reconcile any incorrect numbers, but it’s far less often than with a periodic system. Ultimately, periodic inventory control systems are typically best suited for smaller organizations with few inventory items to manage and track. For larger companies with hundreds of items to keep track of, a perpetual control system is the more cost-effective option. How do I cost-effectively manage inventory? Alright so, you need to control you inventory to keep your costs down, but what’s the best way to do that? There are essentially three ways to manage inventory, regardless of what control system you use:
- Paper checklists
- Inventory management software
Each system can be useful, but only one will help you keep costs down and improve your ROI. Let’s find out which one. Pen and paper checklists
Believe it or not, there are still many companies that attempt to manage their entire inventory with a pen and paper. This can work, if you are a very small business with just a few items that aren’t very critical to your operations. Doing everything by hand significantly increases the potential for human error and it requires a lot of time spent away from more productive tasks. The next step up from a pad of paper is spreadsheets. You can store an enormous amount of data in them, and your team can update them instantly as needed. The problem with spreadsheets is that when someone updates them, suddenly that specific version of the file is now the most up to date so if unless the next updates the exact same file, you no longer have a unified source of data. Spreadsheets still require manual updates and modifications so you’re still spending money for someone to keep that spreadsheet updated. While they can get the job done in some cases, spreadsheets are still not the most cost-effective way to manage complex inventories. Inventory management software
Data and automation are the tools of industry and are proven to help control costs and improve ROI. Apply these powerful tools to your inventory with inventory management software to get more from your inventory. With this software, you can implement a robust perpetual control system and track every item across your entire operation, even across multiple facilities. The best part about this is that you can instantly see where you inventory costs are going. Instead of waiting to reconcile your inventory accounting a few times a year, you can quickly tell which parts are not being used efficiently and which parts you aren’t using as much. In fact, most organizations don’t use as much as 90% of their MRO inventory every year and your software solution can show you what parts aren’t being utilized efficiently. Remember that money we were leaving on the table with inefficient purchasing and ordering methods for restocking inventory? Inventory management software helps ensure you don’t miss a single dollar.

5 Inventory Planning Best Practices
In a session we co-presented at the recent National Conference on Operations & Fulfillment in Las Vegas, we led a panel that delivered the following top five inventory planning best practices:
- Build partnerships with suppliers. View your suppliers as subordinates and they’ll simply do your bidding. Work with them as partners and you’ll succeed together. You'll achieve more sales — with higher fulfillment, fewer overstocks and better inventory turnover — if you have a partner relationship with suppliers. Communicate with suppliers comprehensively and often. If they can anticipate your needs, they have a better chance of having raw materials and manufacturing capacity available when you need it. Establish these relationships so suppliers can tell you any bad news before delays in production or delivery impact your business. - Capture shadow or lost demand. Incomplete or inaccurate demand data leads to faulty demand planning and inaccurate purchasing decisions. What's more, it negatively impacts staff efficiency. Without accurate demand data, merchants can make incorrect decisions about strong vs. weak sellers. In addition, not capturing lost demand understates response rates and average order size, potentially impacting future list selection. - Measure both order and item fulfillment. Order fulfillment is the best measure of customer satisfaction. It gauges the percentage of customers that are shipped their orders complete at the time of order. The best measure of inventory buying performance is item fulfillment. This measures the percentage of individual items that are shipped to customers when ordered. Understand the relationship between the two so individual inventory buyers can comprehend their impact on total customer experience. - Forecast Internet demand. With Web sales growing to more than 50 percent of total sales for many catalogers, there's growing concern about how best to forecast. First, understand the true source of the demand. On average, only 10 percent to 20 percent of Internet demand is truly “incremental” and not driven by other media. There are two main approaches to online forecasting: time-phased modeling and traditional offer-based forecasting with demand curves. Both are valid. Ensure that you understand the marketing dynamics of your business to apply the appropriate mix of the two forecasting models. For details, see Ray Goodman’s March 2009 Catalog Success article, “Grab the Bull by Both Horns.”
- Build processes for speed. Every day yields new information to consider. Success is directly related to the speed of receiving, processing and acting on new information. Whether it’s reforecasting demand, placing new purchase orders or adjusting existing ones, build systems and processes that maximize speed.

Everyone knows inventory out means money in, but without a clear view of your goods from initial receipt to ship date, your company’s largest asset could be losing you money. The key to an efficient and profitable business is total visibility into the inventory process from start to finish and management tools to help you maintain optimal stock levels year-round. An effective inventory management system helps you streamline all the moving parts of your warehouse: From recommending optimal stock levels all the way to keeping your supply chain organized and running smoothly. Learn the basics of inventory management and discover how an inventory management system can help you increase profitability and reduce waste. Inventory is usually one of the largest assets a company owns, which is why inventory mismanagement is one of the top reasons small businesses fail. Inefficient asset inventory management can decrease your profitability in several ways:
Having more stock on hand than you actually need can cost you. You have to pay for more warehouse space, which is expensive, and perishable items can spoil before you’re able to sell them. Staying ahead of the curve on retail trends helps you capitalize on the popular items customers want at the moment. If you’re slow to adapt to the changing market, however, customers will look elsewhere and you’ll surrender market share. Customers will order from somewhere else if you don’t have what they want in stock. At the very least, stockouts will cost you sales. If they happen often, you’ll lose customers. Investing in an inventory management system can yield excellent ROI. Not only does an inventory management system make it easier to get your products to the customers who want them, it can provide valuable insights so that you’re ordering the right inventory at the right time and in the right quantities. Here are some examples of how investing in inventory management pays off:
Order inventory in the right quantities at the right time so that you’re never over- or under-stocked. More productivity and less time wasted looking for missing items or tracking things by hand. Well-managed stock leads to more efficient and organized warehouses. Orders ship faster and are more accurate, leading to satisfied customers and upheld service level agreements. Inventory is considered a business asset, so inventory management ties in closely with accounting. When inventory and accounting are integrated well, you get real-time metrics into your goods at every step of the process. Your inventory management system should support multiple inventory valuation methods and functions such as:
The cost of goods sold divided by average inventory on hand. Low turnover rate indicates duplicate orders and deteriorating inventory value. High turnover rate can mean excess shipping costs to quickly replace things that are out of stock, incomplete orders, and wasted time trying to locate missing items. Balanced turnover rate indicates high efficiency, lower costs, and higher customer satisfaction. The cost of available goods for sale divided by the number of units for sale. This metric yields the weighted average cost per unit. Estimate of the expected cost for an item in the accounting records, which is periodically checked against the actual cost. The variance between the two numbers is recorded in the accounting records. This method is used when it’s too time-consuming to track actual costs in real time. Refers to the list of sub-items that make up a single inventory item. Bundling the parts and items that make up a single finished item. A logistics term that refers to receiving inventory just before or at the exact time it’s needed. Tracks inventory from manufacturing to when it’s used on the production shop or factory floor. Inventory management software tracks, manages, and organizes inventory levels, orders, sales, and deliveries. The purpose of inventory management software is to maintain an optimal inventory level, track goods during transport between locations, receive new items, manage warehouse processes such as picking, packing, and shipping, prevent product obsolescence and spoilage, and ensure your products are never out of stock. Software for inventory management automates what used to be a time-consuming, manual process of counting each item one by one and recording it on paper. Digitizing this process not only makes it more accurate, it saves valuable time. Core capabilities include inventory optimization, product identification and tracking, service management for service-oriented companies, asset tracking, and reorder points.

Effective inventory management is aimed at finding the optimum between the high availability of inventory items (driven by customer service objectives) and the tied capital in order to reduce expenses (a financial objective); definitely two conflicting objectives. As a result, “Supply Chain” professionals are under constant pressure to reduce inventory and there are many reasons why. We have all heard of dead, slow moving, duplicate and overly stocked items sitting in warehouses where the cash could have been utilized somewhere else in the company to deliver profit instead of incurring carrying cost. While I must say a lot of progress has been made on this, keep in mind though that if at any point in the process the maintenance or production departments are unable to meet their schedules due to lack of operational/maintenance parts or production material then all hell breaks loose. As such, “Supply Chain” professionals and more specifically “Inventory Control” in-charge are faced with this constant puzzle/dilemma: “How to maintain effective Customer Service with the lowest Inventory Levels possible”; easier said than done. Hence what can be done? Before looking at solutions, we need to examine the following issues prior to taking any decision regarding when and how much to order:
Once we have had clear answers to the above, we need to scientifically calculate the ROP (Re-Order Point) for each Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) and strategize how to order. The ROP inventory replenishment technique considers forecasted demand over the replenishment lead time period, plus an allowance for safety stock. The ROP can be scientifically calculated depending on the situation. There are four distinct situations for calculating and setting the ROP, as follows:
When the inventory level of an item goes down to a pre-specified minimum level (ROP), an “Economic Order Quantity” (EOQ) is ordered to replenish the system. This EOQ is intended to be a balanced quantity that optimizes both the purchasing cost and the carrying cost for the inventory hence keeping the total inventory cost to a minimum. The EOQ model finds the optimal order quantity keeping the above two constraints in mind. However, the EOQ model is not the best solution for all items. For very expensive items, the strategy could be to order the exact amount needed, while for cheap consumable items, buying in bulk makes more sense. On the other hand companies that employ a JIT (Just-In-Time) approach consider the EOQ as a waste since the purchased quantities ordered should only be the ones required for the next immediate schedule. Then you also have the blanket agreement option. Each of the above strategies has its own pros and cons depending on the situation and unfortunately there is no one single solution that fits all scenarios. As such, it becomes imperative that the right strategy be used for the corresponding situation. Last but not least, the inventory specialists should be accountable for the two most important and conflicting inventory KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) which are:

Because inventories are often a sizable investment, they require careful management. But what is inventory control? It includes the efficient management of purchasing, receiving, warehousing, tracking, shipping and reordering — and it’s how you maximize the return on your inventory. Why Is Inventory Control Important? Inventory can be the largest portion of your company’s assets and can affect your company’s cash flow. Inventory management that increases turnover and lowers investment can improve your cash flow. For example, if you reduced your $500,000 inventory to $450,000, that $50,000 difference could end up in your bank account. According to Investopedia, inventory carrying cost — that is, the expenses related to keeping and storing unsold goods, such as financing, insurance, taxes, transportation and shrinkage loss — is usually between 20% and 30% of an inventory’s value. So that $500,000 inventory could cost you $150,000 every year. Part of good inventory management is being sure you have enough stock to meet customer demand. Few things irritate a customer more than finding out that an item is out of stock after they’ve placed an order. Managing Inventory Control
Here are seven tips for better inventory management. - Use ABC analysis. Classify the items in your inventory into three groups: A, B and C. Pay the strictest attention to A items, which are likely your most profitable high-ticket sellers. B items are moderately priced. C items are low-priced items with the highest turnover. - Follow the 80/20 rule. The top 20% of your items will likely account for 80% of your profits. These will probably be your A items. Make sure they get the most attention. - Identify low-turnover items. If you haven’t sold a particular item in 12 months, it probably doesn’t belong in your inventory. - Set reorder points. When your stock of an item dips below a certain quantity, you’ll need to order more. Be sure to account for the lead time to replenish your stock. - Track stock levels. Pay attention to your stock levels as you approach reorder points. - Audit frequently. The more you audit and reconcile your inventory, the better you’ll be at managing it. - Use cloud-based software. Invest in inventory management software to make tracking and reordering easier. What is inventory control worth to your business? It could be a lot. Your inventory is a large investment, so treat it with the utmost care. A well-balanced inventory can ensure that you maintain a healthy cash flow without carrying extra costs.","[{'passage': 'Inventory is usually the biggest cash investment a business makes every year and if you do not have an inventory policy, then that cash investment has no approval process.

You wouldn’t let any other significant expenditure be made without a detailed approval process, so why inventory? Here are a few points on how to manage your inventory effectively. Make to Order (MTO) vs. Make to Stock (MTS)\nIf you are a manufacturing business then you should be carefully analysing the MTO and MTS. You should assess the frequency, value and volume of each product and then overlay this information with the commercial strategy. If a product is sold infrequently, generates low returns, and does not form part of a wider commercial offering, then it should not be MTS. In fact, it should probably be delisted altogether. It doesn’t make sense to invest your cash in all products equally. Isn’t it better to have more stock, and consequently a better service level, for those products that generate the most sales and the most revenue? This is the purpose of an ABC classification. An ABC classification, sometimes called ‘runners, repeaters, strangers’, is an opportunity to focus cash, and improved service levels, at the products that are critically important to your business. Broadly speaking your inventory targets should be comprised of two components, cycle stock and safety stock. Cycle stock is straightforward – it is the mean expected demand during the replenishment lead time. Safety stock is more complex, and often overlooked. Safety stock is a probability assessment of demand exceeding the mean during the replenishment lead time, combined with the probability of delays in the replenishment lead time. This should be properly calculated – rules of thumb do not work and will leave you with too little or too much stock. Devising an inventory policy is not a one-off exercise. As your business profile changes, new products will come in, old products will go out and sales will increase and decrease. These factors will impact your inventory targets and consequently you should be making revisions to your MTO/MTS, portfolio classification and inventory targets periodically. If you do not have inventory management software then simple models can be developed in MS Excel to achieve this. Developing an inventory policy is not just about the known numbers; it is not purely an analytical exercise. You need to ensure that the analysis is overlaid with the expectations of the product life cycle, market promotions, sales strategies and commercial forecasts. It is important that there is cross-functional consensus from the commercial, finance and operations teams on the levels of inventory being targeted. Once you have an inventory policy established and a process for periodic review, then you should be looking at levers on how you can work to reduce stock. There are a number of methods you can use, but typically businesses should focus on:\n- Modifying service levels (reducing service against ‘B’ & ‘C’ class items);\n- Increasing MTO;\n- Introducing minimum order quantities (MOQs) for customers;\n- Negotiating higher frequency, lower volume deliveries with suppliers;\n- Rationalising the portfolio;\n- Improving forecasting and considering implementing Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP).', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:092907a1-da56-46d8-baf7-0b2189d01c52>']}, {'passage': 'Plus, as with any task where humans are involved, the risk of human error is potentially high, particularly if employees feel rushed to complete the process as quickly as possible to keep labor costs down. It’s also difficult to locate the source of any mismatched numbers in a periodic system because so much time passes between counts that it’s hard to know when and where the numbers became off. Smaller organizations tend to benefit more from periodic systems because the cost involved are more manageable with less inventory and fewer labor hours to consider. Perpetual inventory control systems take a different approach. Instead of only tracking inventory at periodic intervals, you track each item throughout its journey across your facility. From the moment you receive it, to the moment it is used in your operations, sold, or scrapped, it’s tracked. You get up-to-the-minute data on precisely where your items are and what they’re being used for. This data is gathered from sensors, barcodes, and scanners that keep tabs on items in real time, helping to eliminate errors from miscounts and helping your team pull inventory items more efficiently. The moment out-of-stock items are received and allocated to the proper bin, your team can be notified and begin using them immediately, instead of sitting on the shelf waiting for the next cycle count. The challenges of perpetual systems are different that those for periodic systems. Instead of needing large amounts of labor to perform counts, you need to invest money upfront in the sensors, barcodes, scanners, software, and other technology that helps you collect your data. And the more locations you have, the more equipment you need to buy. You’ll still need to perform cycle counts periodically to reconcile any incorrect numbers, but it’s far less often than with a periodic system. Ultimately, periodic inventory control systems are typically best suited for smaller organizations with few inventory items to manage and track. For larger companies with hundreds of items to keep track of, a perpetual control system is the more cost-effective option. How do I cost-effectively manage inventory? Alright so, you need to control you inventory to keep your costs down, but what’s the best way to do that? There are essentially three ways to manage inventory, regardless of what control system you use:\n- Paper checklists\n- Inventory management software\nEach system can be useful, but only one will help you keep costs down and improve your ROI. Let’s find out which one. Pen and paper checklists\nBelieve it or not, there are still many companies that attempt to manage their entire inventory with a pen and paper. This can work, if you are a very small business with just a few items that aren’t very critical to your operations. Doing everything by hand significantly increases the potential for human error and it requires a lot of time spent away from more productive tasks. The next step up from a pad of paper is spreadsheets. You can store an enormous amount of data in them, and your team can update them instantly as needed. The problem with spreadsheets is that when someone updates them, suddenly that specific version of the file is now the most up to date so if unless the next updates the exact same file, you no longer have a unified source of data. Spreadsheets still require manual updates and modifications so you’re still spending money for someone to keep that spreadsheet updated. While they can get the job done in some cases, spreadsheets are still not the most cost-effective way to manage complex inventories. Inventory management software\nData and automation are the tools of industry and are proven to help control costs and improve ROI. Apply these powerful tools to your inventory with inventory management software to get more from your inventory. With this software, you can implement a robust perpetual control system and track every item across your entire operation, even across multiple facilities. The best part about this is that you can instantly see where you inventory costs are going. Instead of waiting to reconcile your inventory accounting a few times a year, you can quickly tell which parts are not being used efficiently and which parts you aren’t using as much. In fact, most organizations don’t use as much as 90% of their MRO inventory every year and your software solution can show you what parts aren’t being utilized efficiently.

View your suppliers as subordinates and they’ll simply do your bidding. Work with them as partners and you’ll succeed together. You'll achieve more sales — with higher fulfillment, fewer overstocks and better inventory turnover — if you have a partner relationship with suppliers. Communicate with suppliers comprehensively and often. If they can anticipate your needs, they have a better chance of having raw materials and manufacturing capacity available when you need it. Establish these relationships so suppliers can tell you any bad news before delays in production or delivery impact your business. - Capture shadow or lost demand. Incomplete or inaccurate demand data leads to faulty demand planning and inaccurate purchasing decisions. What's more, it negatively impacts staff efficiency. Without accurate demand data, merchants can make incorrect decisions about strong vs. weak sellers. In addition, not capturing lost demand understates response rates and average order size, potentially impacting future list selection. - Measure both order and item fulfillment. Order fulfillment is the best measure of customer satisfaction. It gauges the percentage of customers that are shipped their orders complete at the time of order. The best measure of inventory buying performance is item fulfillment. This measures the percentage of individual items that are shipped to customers when ordered. Understand the relationship between the two so individual inventory buyers can comprehend their impact on total customer experience. - Forecast Internet demand. With Web sales growing to more than 50 percent of total sales for many catalogers, there's growing concern about how best to forecast. First, understand the true source of the demand. On average, only 10 percent to 20 percent of Internet demand is truly “incremental” and not driven by other media. There are two main approaches to online forecasting: time-phased modeling and traditional offer-based forecasting with demand curves. Both are valid. Ensure that you understand the marketing dynamics of your business to apply the appropriate mix of the two forecasting models.

The key to an efficient and profitable business is total visibility into the inventory process from start to finish and management tools to help you maintain optimal stock levels year-round. An effective inventory management system helps you streamline all the moving parts of your warehouse: From recommending optimal stock levels all the way to keeping your supply chain organized and running smoothly. Learn the basics of inventory management and discover how an inventory management system can help you increase profitability and reduce waste. Inventory is usually one of the largest assets a company owns, which is why inventory mismanagement is one of the top reasons small businesses fail. Inefficient asset inventory management can decrease your profitability in several ways:\nHaving more stock on hand than you actually need can cost you. You have to pay for more warehouse space, which is expensive, and perishable items can spoil before you’re able to sell them. Staying ahead of the curve on retail trends helps you capitalize on the popular items customers want at the moment. If you’re slow to adapt to the changing market, however, customers will look elsewhere and you’ll surrender market share. Customers will order from somewhere else if you don’t have what they want in stock. At the very least, stockouts will cost you sales. If they happen often, you’ll lose customers. Investing in an inventory management system can yield excellent ROI. Not only does an inventory management system make it easier to get your products to the customers who want them, it can provide valuable insights so that you’re ordering the right inventory at the right time and in the right quantities. Here are some examples of how investing in inventory management pays off:\nOrder inventory in the right quantities at the right time so that you’re never over- or under-stocked. More productivity and less time wasted looking for missing items or tracking things by hand. Well-managed stock leads to more efficient and organized warehouses. Orders ship faster and are more accurate, leading to satisfied customers and upheld service level agreements. Inventory is considered a business asset, so inventory management ties in closely with accounting. When inventory and accounting are integrated well, you get real-time metrics into your goods at every step of the process. Your inventory management system should support multiple inventory valuation methods and functions such as:\nThe cost of goods sold divided by average inventory on hand. Low turnover rate indicates duplicate orders and deteriorating inventory value. High turnover rate can mean excess shipping costs to quickly replace things that are out of stock, incomplete orders, and wasted time trying to locate missing items. Balanced turnover rate indicates high efficiency, lower costs, and higher customer satisfaction. The cost of available goods for sale divided by the number of units for sale. This metric yields the weighted average cost per unit. Estimate of the expected cost for an item in the accounting records, which is periodically checked against the actual cost. The variance between the two numbers is recorded in the accounting records. This method is used when it’s too time-consuming to track actual costs in real time.

Inventory management software tracks, manages, and organizes inventory levels, orders, sales, and deliveries. The purpose of inventory management software is to maintain an optimal inventory level, track goods during transport between locations, receive new items, manage warehouse processes such as picking, packing, and shipping, prevent product obsolescence and spoilage, and ensure your products are never out of stock. Software for inventory management automates what used to be a time-consuming, manual process of counting each item one by one and recording it on paper.

Eid | Managing Director\n28th January, 2015\nEffective inventory management is aimed at finding the optimum between the high availability of inventory items (driven by customer service objectives) and the tied capital in order to reduce expenses (a financial objective); definitely two conflicting objectives. As a result, “Supply Chain” professionals are under constant pressure to reduce inventory and there are many reasons why. We have all heard of dead, slow moving, duplicate and overly stocked items sitting in warehouses where the cash could have been utilized somewhere else in the company to deliver profit instead of incurring carrying cost. While I must say a lot of progress has been made on this, keep in mind though that if at any point in the process the maintenance or production departments are unable to meet their schedules due to lack of operational/maintenance parts or production material then all hell breaks loose. As such, “Supply Chain” professionals and more specifically “Inventory Control” in-charge are faced with this constant puzzle/dilemma: “How to maintain effective Customer Service with the lowest Inventory Levels possible”; easier said than done. Hence what can be done? Before looking at solutions, we need to examine the following issues prior to taking any decision regarding when and how much to order:\nOnce we have had clear answers to the above, we need to scientifically calculate the ROP (Re-Order Point) for each Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) and strategize how to order. The ROP inventory replenishment technique considers forecasted demand over the replenishment lead time period, plus an allowance for safety stock. The ROP can be scientifically calculated depending on the situation. There are four distinct situations for calculating and setting the ROP, as follows:\nWhen the inventory level of an item goes down to a pre-specified minimum level (ROP), an “Economic Order Quantity” (EOQ) is ordered to replenish the system. This EOQ is intended to be a balanced quantity that optimizes both the purchasing cost and the carrying cost for the inventory hence keeping the total inventory cost to a minimum. The EOQ model finds the optimal order quantity keeping the above two constraints in mind. However, the EOQ model is not the best solution for all items. For very expensive items, the strategy could be to order the exact amount needed, while for cheap consumable items, buying in bulk makes more sense. On the other hand companies that employ a JIT (Just-In-Time) approach consider the EOQ as a waste since the purchased quantities ordered should only be the ones required for the next immediate schedule. Then you also have the blanket agreement option. Each of the above strategies has its own pros and cons depending on the situation and unfortunately there is no one single solution that fits all scenarios. As such, it becomes imperative that the right strategy be used for the corresponding situation. Last but not least, the inventory specialists should be accountable for the two most important and conflicting inventory KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) which are:\nChaouki Eid, Deputy Managing Director, Meirc Training & Consulting.

But what is inventory control? It includes the efficient management of purchasing, receiving, warehousing, tracking, shipping and reordering — and it’s how you maximize the return on your inventory. Why Is Inventory Control Important? Inventory can be the largest portion of your company’s assets and can affect your company’s cash flow. Inventory management that increases turnover and lowers investment can improve your cash flow. For example, if you reduced your $500,000 inventory to $450,000, that $50,000 difference could end up in your bank account. According to Investopedia, inventory carrying cost — that is, the expenses related to keeping and storing unsold goods, such as financing, insurance, taxes, transportation and shrinkage loss — is usually between 20% and 30% of an inventory’s value. So that $500,000 inventory could cost you $150,000 every year. Part of good inventory management is being sure you have enough stock to meet customer demand. Few things irritate a customer more than finding out that an item is out of stock after they’ve placed an order. Managing Inventory Control\nHere are seven tips for better inventory management. - Use ABC analysis. Classify the items in your inventory into three groups: A, B and C. Pay the strictest attention to A items, which are likely your most profitable high-ticket sellers. B items are moderately priced. C items are low-priced items with the highest turnover. - Follow the 80/20 rule. The top 20% of your items will likely account for 80% of your profits. These will probably be your A items. Make sure they get the most attention. - Identify low-turnover items. If you haven’t sold a particular item in 12 months, it probably doesn’t belong in your inventory. - Set reorder points. When your stock of an item dips below a certain quantity, you’ll need to order more. Be sure to account for the lead time to replenish your stock. - Track stock levels. Pay attention to your stock levels as you approach reorder points. - Audit frequently. The more you audit and reconcile your inventory, the better you’ll be at managing it. - Use cloud-based software. Invest in inventory management software to make tracking and reordering easier.

                ""text"": ""Inventory shrink in the United States cost the retail industry about $46.8 billion. A business must have an efficient system of inventory management. The process involves tracking the stock and inventory life cycle once it gets to your business. If you aren\u2019t aware of your inventory, decision making becomes problematic. Whether you are a brick-and-mortar or an online retailer, inventory management is imperative. With the different techniques available, you can\u2019t miss a solution that will work for your business. What are the secrets small businesses can use to save money on inventory management? Learn how to manage inventories more effectively now. One principle of inventory management you ought to consider is the first-in, first-out approach. This inventory method ensures you sell your old stock first. It is especially vital when selling perishable products that might end up as spoilage. The first in, first out approach, commonly referred to as FIFO, also applies to non-perishables. Items can be worn out over time, that\u2019s why storing them for long isn\u2019t advisable. What\u2019s more, the packaging designs keep changing. You need to restructure your warehouse in a way that encourages FIFO. Have a back door to ensure that the new products are at the backside. When the old products are at the front, the chances are that they will sell before the new entrants. 2. Use a Real-time and Centralized Database\nThe days of pen and paper in-store inventory control are over. Companies are adopting efficient options such as Excel to manage inventory. Nonetheless, the use of paper is still evident though minimal. With today\u2019s dynamic business environment, inventory management should be within a centralized database. A supply chain has multiple users. A centralized system will allow all users to access the database in real-time. An inventory tracking system allows you to check products from the point the supplier delivers up until it reaches the customer. You need to note down the description and value of each item. Analyze the time the supplier takes to deliver. You can see the stock at this stage and plan. The timely interventions will save you money and waste. Besides, you\u2019ll know if it\u2019s necessary to make any adjustments at each point of the supply chain. Recent research projects that automation will reduce the need for office support by 20%. Industries are adopting automation because of increased efficiency. If you\u2019ve been wondering how to manage inventories, automation can be an ideal option. Inputting data manually can be time-consuming and full of errors. The process is repetitive and can be quite daunting for your employees. Save your workers the overwhelming tasks and automate some processes. Automating most of your inventory management processes can increase scale-able. If you have to email and call your suppliers and workers each day to know the amount of inventory, it means that your business isn\u2019t scale-able. Automated systems allow you to gather information faster. Automation decreases human error that\u2019s imminent when making manual entries. Consequently, you might undersell or oversell your items. Automation allows you to edit or upgrade inventory at any time. With automated inventory processes, you don\u2019t need to spend hours analyzing data at the expense of other business operations. Adopt systems that will help in maximizing time. An extra hour in your business is a resource worth pursuing. 4. Stock Auditing\nThe stock audit is the physical verification of the inventory assets of a company. Auditing your inventory is not an exciting process. Yet, it is crucial for effective inventory management. Moving thousands of items increases the risk of unnoticed loses or damages. Failure to track your stock can lead to business disappointments. Imagine taking and processing a customer order only to realize the item is not in stock? You might lose customer credibility just because of not auditing your stock. Regular stock auditing notifies you on items that are out of stock. Have an up-to-date warehouse to avoid losing sales. Entrepreneurs such as restaurant owners need to make regular audits to maintain customer satisfaction. You can get restaurant inventory management software to control inventory and optimize the ordering process. Stock auditing is necessary for any industry. It will allow you to identify discrepancies and curtail cases of theft and employee malpractices. You can shop for software that can help in regular auditing to have an update on the available stock. 5."",

                ""text"": ""There are around 33 million small businesses making their homes in the US. Many, possibly even most, of these businesses must maintain a certain amount of inventory. After all, unless your business deals in purely intellectual property, such as freelance writers, graphic artists, or software providers, you\u2019re likely either servicing physical property or selling physical property. Even medical services maintain a stock of medices and supplies. That means keeping an inventory of parts to use or an inventory or products to sell. Either way, you must keep track of those parts and products. Enter the inventory management system. Not sure how to select the right software for managing inventory in your business? Keep reading for a breakdown of some key concerns. One of the most important aspects of picking a business inventory management system is the feature set. For example, if you have a retail outlet, will the system integrate with your point-of-sale system? If your business has e-commerce options, will the inventory management software integrate with your e-commerce platform of choice? Most businesses also want features like automated reordering and barcode scanning. Before you go looking at options and making decisions, sit down and make a list of the features that you need and want. This list will help you narrow down the options that can meet your baseline needs. Another consideration when choosing a system for managing inventory is customization. Most systems will allow for some level of customization. Even so, that doesn\u2019t mean that the options will suit your business needs. For example, inventory management for veterinarians is a very different animal than inventory management for a restaurant. For example, vets in many states must track their medications for reporting purposes. Restaurants typically don\u2019t report their lettuce purchases or use. Depending on how specialized your business is, you may want to consider looking for an industry-specific choice. Every small business must monitor its expenses and cash flow. Granted, inventory management software isn\u2019t the most expensive thing in the world. The software does usually operate on a subscription model. That subscription gives the business a recurring cost for the software every month or every year, depending on how they pay for it. You should compare the cost of the software options that meet your needs. You should also take a hard look at what you can easily afford, even if things get tight. Lowballing your own means a little may cost you a few nice-to-have options, but it won\u2019t leave scrambling to pay for the software down the road. Picking Your Inventory Management System\nPicking your inventory management system calls for the same kind of decision-making process you apply to most services. You look for options that offer the features you want and need. You consider how well you can customize the software to your specific business needs. Then, you evaluate the pricing based on your projected ability to pay in the future. Looking for more business technology tips? Check out the posts in our Technology section."",

If you\u2019re starting or running a small business, it can be difficult to decide how to choose the right inventory system. There are many options, and they all have different features and price points and all of the five we mention in this article have a free plan to get you started. Here are our top tips for finding the right inventory management software for your small business:\n\u25cf Your Requirements\nWhen choosing inventory management software, it\u2019s important to consider your specific business needs. Are you a small business owner who has only just started? Or are you running a large-scale operation that requires a lot of logistics and tracking? If you\u2019re a small business owner, you probably don\u2019t need anything too complicated or expensive. A basic inventory management system will do the trick. You can use this kind of software to keep track of what your company has in stock and make sure it\u2019s always replenished when needed. When choosing the best inventory management software for your SME, consider the flexibility of the software. The more flexible an inventory software is, the more likely it will be able to adapt to your needs as they change over time. If you don\u2019t choose a system with enough flexibility, it may be unable to keep pace with your growing business. So, be sure that your software can handle the number of products you\u2019re selling and has room for growth in the future. A lot of small businesses have limited staff and resources. So it\u2019s important that your inventory management software can work with other programs in your business. You may have a point-of-sale system that you want to sync up with your inventory management software. Besides, you might want a customer relationship management (CRM) system integrated with your inventory management software. These integrations allow you to automate processes, save time and money, and get more accurate data from every aspect of your business. Inventory management software that doesn\u2019t offer you the ability to customise it is a waste of time and money. You need a system that works for your business, not against it. Look for an inventory management system with customizable options, from reports and dashboards to inventory control and workflow automation. This will help you adjust the software to fit exactly what you need out of your inventory management system. \u25cf Easy to Use\nThe best inventory management software for your small business will be easy to use. You don\u2019t have time to waste, so you want a program that\u2019s intuitive and easy to set up. Look for software that has an intuitive interface and allows you to get started right away. You should also ensure that the program is compatible with your computer or mobile device. \u25cf Free Trial\nYou\u2019ll want to ensure that the software you choose will handle your business\u2019s needs and that it will be easy to use and implement. One way to ensure you choose the best option is its free trial. A free trial of the software will allow you to explore all its features and determine whether or not it\u2019s a good fit for your company. While looking at cost, think about how much time and money you can afford to spend upfront on the inventory management software and ongoing training and support costs. Generally, the price of the software will vary based on the features and capabilities you need. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in fancy features and forget about price\u2014but remember that even if something looks great on paper, it may not be worth paying extra money for. \u25cf Customer Support\nConsider the customer service of the vendor. Ask, if something goes wrong with your software, how quickly can you get help? Does the company offer phone support? Is there an option for email support? Are there training resources available if you need them? That way, if something goes wrong, you\u2019ll be able to resolve it quickly so that your business isn\u2019t interrupted. The best inventory management software can help you optimise how you keep your business\u2019s products and inventory. By finding the right software for small businesses, you can be sure that everything on your records is accurate and up-to-date. In this article, we have outlined five of the best free inventory management software products for small businesses.

A plan to force more Oklahoma school districts to return to five-day school weeks has cleared the Oklahoma Senate.
The Senate voted 31-17 on Thursday for the bill that now goes to the House.
According to the state Department of Education, 92 of Oklahoma's more than 500 school districts currently are operating on four-day school weeks. In those cases, instructional hours are extended each day to reach the required number of hours.
The bill by Republican Sen. Marty Quinn would allow schools to continue operating four-day weeks if the district meets minimum guidelines for student performance and cost savings.
Oklahoma Superintendent of Public Instruction Joy Hofmeister praised the Senate's passage of the measure.
Supporters of the four-day school week says it helps districts save money and recruit teachers.","Factuality > non-factoid, Premise > direct","A question to get advice or recommendations on a particular topic; question that does not contain any premise or any information about the user) (e.g., ‘what is the fee for speeding in Italy?’)",User-Expertise > novice,a regular user with no understanding of specialized terms.,What are the benefits of having four-day school weeks?,Four-day school weeks help districts save money and recruit teachers.,"The benefits of having four-day school weeks include:

1. **Cost savings**: By trimming one day off the week, a school can save on bus services, cafeteria costs, and facilities costs, which can be especially crucial during state budget shortfalls.

2. **Improved student academic performance**: Some studies suggest that student attendance and engagement can increase, leading to better academic performance.

3. **Increased teacher vitality and morale**: Teachers have more time for preparation, meetings, and personal time, which can lead to increased morale and decreased burnout.

4. **Decreased student discipline problems**: The longer instructional days can lead to more engaged and focused students, which may result in fewer discipline issues.

5. **Better family time**: A three-day weekend can provide more time for families to spend together and engage in extracurricular activities.

6. **Enhanced professional development**: Teachers can use the extra day for professional development, which can improve their teaching skills and effectiveness.

7. **Increased flexibility**: The four-day week can be adjusted to accommodate national holidays, ensuring students still receive four days of instruction every week.

8. **Reduced childcare concerns**: Some districts offer childcare services on the off day, alleviating the burden on parents who work.

9. **Improved teacher and student attendance**: Studies have found that both teachers and students tend to attend school more regularly on a four-day schedule.

10. **Increased instructional time**: By reconfiguring non-instructional activities to the off day, schools can potentially increase the amount of time dedicated to teaching and learning.","You are a helpful assistant.

### Context: Crosscut recently reported on the Eatonville School District's consideration of a four-day school week, which is already being used by two rural school districts with fewer than 150 students in Eastern Washington. During this legislative session, Sen. Randi Becker R-Eatonville, proposed a bill that would allow 20 school districts of up to 2,200 students to use the four-day school week. Here, Don Kordosky, superintendent of Oregon's Oakridge School District, shares his personal experience and insights on making the switch. When considering the switch from a five-day school week to a four-day school week, one need only recall that classic saying: “Less is more.”
As superintendent of Oakridge School District in Oregon, I learned this through personal experience when my schools made the switch. Initially, I was against the idea. How could a four-day week possibly be in the best interest of students? But after doing the research and seeing the benefits firsthand, I became a complete supporter. The positives of the four-day week far outweigh the negatives, and the negatives can all be alleviated through well-thought-out strategies. The parents of our students, the staff, the school board, and the entire community of Oakridge reviewed the four-day week for an entire year prior to implementation. Since implementation I have become a four-day week advocate because of all the positive attributes including: better student academic performance, increased teacher vitality, increased student engagement, decreased student discipline problems, and an improvement to the overall culture of excellence for the district. Most school districts originally begin a review of the four-day school week as a strategy to address financial shortfalls. (Mine did not.) By trimming one day off the week, a school can save in bus services, cafeteria, and facilities costs. This can be especially crucial during state budget shortfalls, where K-12 funding can be in danger of cuts, and even more so for rural school districts, which must run their schools on a minimal budget. But not all school districts go to a four-day week because of money, and certainly it is not the only way a school can benefit from the change. The four-day week is not for all districts, and there are negative attributes that need to have alleviation strategies in place prior to implementation. Negative attributes include parent fears of not being able to find child care on Fridays, fatigue for students that have to attend school for longer days, and decreases in compensation for employees who lose hours. An example of an alleviation strategy for the child care concern is the offering of Red Cross Childcare First Aid certification classes for high school students. These students then became available for parents who could not find relatives or other child care on Fridays. Another strategy is offering extra duty employment for bus drivers, cooks, and custodians, who all lose significant hours. In our district we made it a practice to offer all paid athletic supervision and activity duties to the employees who lost work time prior to other employees. Regardless of the negative consequence associated with the four-day week, there are strategies to alleviate the negative impact on students, families and staff. Of note, many parents have found that eliminating the large number of half-days for students that plague five-day weeks — such as teacher work days, curriculum days, grading days, inservice days, etc. — has made finding childcare easier. With the four-day week, teachers can do their non-teaching activities on the day off, and therefore schools do not have to send children home at awkward and inconsistent times. However, what I have found is that most common four-day school week objections are derived more from a fear of change (and a indeed a reasonable concern) rather than empirical study. When scrutinized, these objections are both addressed and debunked by the switch. To demonstrate that point, here are four reasons why the four-day school week is an improvement to the five-day week. Teacher and student attendance increases. Teachers are the key to student learning, and having the regular classroom teacher in the room instead of a substitute teacher is better for kids. Because teachers are able to schedule meetings, doctor’s appointments and other possible conflicts with their teaching schedule on the extra day off, teachers are better able to provide a consistency for students. In Oakridge, the number of available work hours missed by teachers decreased significantly (21.8%) after the move to a four-day school week. Student attendance typically increases, too.

Most districts that implement a four-day week see substantial improvement in attendance at the high school level per available instructional hours (they spend more time learning, but less days at school). Attendance in some schools increased 3% as measured against available instructional hours. Contrary to fears, instructional time for students can increase from what it was before if it is the wish of the school district. By subtracting non-teaching activities from Fridays (lunch time, passing periods, transportation time, recess) and adding those paid teacher work hours to instructional hours Monday-Thursday, the amount of paid teacher time that is allocated to instruction increases. Each school day is comprised of many activities that have no direct positive correlation to student academic achievement. The time we pay teachers when they are not teaching includes before school starts (usually about 30 minutes), the time that society pays teachers after school (usually 45 minutes), passing periods (typically six passing periods of five minutes each equals 30 minutes). All of this “non-instructional time” on Fridays is eliminated and that time can be changed to instructional time on the other remaining four days. Also, the flexibility of the four-day week allows it to work around national holidays, so even if a Monday needs to be taken off — say, for Labor Day — students can still go to school for four days (Monday-Friday). The four-day school week offers four days of instruction every week, not the inconsistency of the five-day week which often has only three, three and one-half, or four days of student instruction. This is one of the keys to the four-day week: Instead of sending kids home so that teachers can do non-instructional duties you bring teachers in on Fridays to complete non-instructional tasks! On the four-day week, student discipline decreases and student engagement increases. The commonly assumed reason for the decrease in student discipline is that students are more actively engaged in more strenuous and rigorous classes than on a five-day week. Keep in mind that student seat time typically increases in the move from a five-day week to a four-day week, so claims that student discipline incidents decrease because they are in school for less time is not a viable argument. Also, teachers commonly reflect upon the change from a five-day to a four-day week that students work harder, are engaged more, and learn more. Teachers have noted that there is increased intrinsic motivation to cover material in fewer days with more instructional time, and that students adjust to increased expectations by becoming more engaged. Moreover, the extra instructional time allows teachers to better teach more complicated subjects, which can otherwise be a problem especially in math and sciences. Perhaps most importantly, teacher vitality and morale increases tremendously. Teaching is an extremely difficult job, where it is common for teachers to spend long nights and weekends assessing student work and preparing. Any teacher worth their salt does not work only “to the contract” work hours, but does everything they can in their non-working hours to provide as many learning opportunities for their students as possible. On a five-day week it is not uncommon to see teachers work late on Friday nights grading and assessing the week’s student work. Saturdays are often spent working on preparation for the next week’s worth of lessons, leaving Sundays to reinvigorate and spend time with their families. As a result, teachers often start the school year each September bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, ready to face new challenges. But by February, many become exhausted. The four-day week, even though each instructional day is longer, provides three days for teachers to complete needed work and spend some much-needed time with their families. This simple fact increases teacher morale, decreases teacher turnover, and improves teacher vitality. This leads to happier and more energetic teachers, which results in better education for students. Don't let nostalgia for an antiquated tradition cloud your mind — take a few minutes and read about the four-day week and get the facts. Plan for the negative attributes, maximize the positive attributes, and make sure that the community is thoroughly involved in the implementation process. The best way to ensure the failure of the implementation of the four-day week is to “do it to the community, instead of “doing it with the community.”

Four-Day School Week Is on the Rise, Story Says
The idea of a four-day school week is nothing new. It's long been embraced by some small, rural school districts. But a new Associated Press story suggests the practice is spreading amid budget pressures on school systems. Featured is a 4,000-student rural district in Peach County, Ga., where school officials reportedly shifted last year to a four-day schedule to help fill a $1 million budget shortfall. What's intriguing is that both student attendance and standardized test scores have since improved. (Apparently, each school day is longer to make up for lost time.) Across the country, more than 120 districts operate on a four-day week, the AP story says. (If only employers of education journalists would embrace this idea!) Also, over the past couple of years, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Maine have changed state law so that districts can count their academic year by hour rather than days, so that a four-day week is possible, the story says. Nevertheless, the story also identifies an Oklahoma district that plans to switch back to a five-day week, after school officials decided the approach wasn't working well for students or teachers. For a more detailed exploration of a four-day school week, check out this 2008 analysis from the Council on State Governments. Also, I came across a helpful research brief issued last year by the Center for Education Policy, Applied Research, and Evaluation at the University of Southern Maine. It notes that little research has been conducted on the impact of moving to a four-day school week on financial savings, student achievement, or other matters. ""As noted by many observers, the literature that exists on the four-day school
week is mainly positive, but not often peer-reviewed or scientifically based, and few summaries of this literature provide any critical analysis of the results,"" the report says. On the question of student achievement, the report says the shorter week does not appear to have a negative effect, but again cautions that much of the literature reviewed was not held to professional scrutiny. One of the most positive and ubiquitous findings from existing research, the report finds, is improved teacher and student attendance. Finally, the University of Southern Maine's analysis cautions that the actual financial savings from cutting a day out of the school week doesn't always live up to expectations, particularly if personnel costs are not reduced. The savings generally are seen in such areas as transportation, food services, and energy costs.

Driven by hopes of cutting transportation, heating and staff costs, more and more school systems are moving to a four-day school week. Small, rural school districts have been in the vanguard of this trend, but larger urban districts are also making the shift. Right now at least twenty US states have one or more school districts operating on a four-day week, including California, Arizona and Michigan. Though shorter school weeks have been implemented from time to time in the US since the 1930s, and briefly became widespread during the “energy crisis” of the 1970s, definitive studies and reports on the impact of the shortened school week are few. This research brief is one of many that indicate that the change can often improve attendance and morale for both students and teachers. Some proponents even tout improved academic performance; especially where cost savings might forestall teacher layoffs or larger class sizes. (Most evaluations indicate that there is no net effect on achievement, though some reports have shown reduced test scores.) Opponents raise concerns about how long, tiring days in the classroom will affect young children, and point to the burdens placed on working parents to find costly daycare. What is the impact of the four-day week on tutors and tutoring? There may be some downsides the overall effect is likely to be positive. Most encouraging is the fact that some districts instituting a four-day week are explicitly inviting students who need extra help to come to school on their “off day” for tutoring sessions. In some cases, schools are reinvesting the money they’re saving to create tutoring opportunities, such as hiring one-on-one tutors for academic underachievers. Similarly, when the school system in Georgia’s Peach County moved to a four-day week, several community organizations (including Boys and Girls clubs and a church) began offering affordable tutoring on Mondays (their “off day”) for only $10 to $15. Will students have less time and energy after school for tutoring on the days when they attend classes? Some tutors may need to shift their schedules to connect with learners on their off day or on weekends – possibly making for some intensely busy days for tutors. But most schools are pushing dismissal ahead by no more than an hour, while reducing lunch and recess times. So after-school tutoring opportunities might not be adversely impacted. Tutors who connect with students online or “on demand” might benefit from an increase in business as learners move to fit tutoring into their new school-day schedules. For example, tutors who can support “digital learners” who want to learn anytime, anyplace, at their own pace, may take yet more business from traditional tutoring services due to the shorter school week. The “bottom line” for tutors is that shortening the school week can potentially create new opportunities: first by opening up a “tutoring day” on Monday or Friday, and second through increased demand for services in areas where schools are hiring tutors. As always, those who can adapt their offerings to the changing needs of students and their families will be positioned to make the most of the situation. Featured photo courtesy of Jean Valley.

Children as young as six years old are struggling with depression, and teachers all over the country are taking to the streets to lobby for increased funding and better work conditions. Could a four-day school week help solve these problems? Colorado School District 27J made national news when it officially cut Mondays from its school schedule in August 2018. District 27J receives one of the lowest levels of funding in the Denver metropolitan area and struggles to retain teachers as a result. But since switching to the new schedule, the district has enticed teachers from other districts to transfer to 27J. The transition also added US$1 million back into the district’s operating budget, part of which was spent on a Chromebook for every middle and high school student in the district. Though the new schedule met mixed reviews from parents and community members, studies show the shorter week significantly improves the health and happiness of students and teachers. - Colorado schools must meet a minimum quota of 1,080 hours of instruction each school year. - The average school day on a modified schedule lasts for seven and a half to eight hours, compared to the standard six-hour day. - School districts looking to switch to a schedule of less than 160 days must obtain approval from Colorado’s Commissioner of Education. - Not all schools within a district operate on the same schedule. - Schools on a four-day week schedule can save as much as 20 percent on transportation costs and food service programmes. 4-DAY SCHOOL WEEK: Do you think school districts in Southern California should do this? https://t.co/CFZboAUyeA

A brief history of Colorado’s four-day school week
In Colorado, four-day weeks and schedules shorter than 160 days aren’t new. In fact, some Colorado schools have operated on a shorter schedule since the 1980-1981 academic school year. In 1980, a state law was passed that allowed school districts to operate on alternative schedules. That same academic year, three school districts moved to a four-day school week. The following academic year, 12 school districts made the switch. Unsurprisingly, for many school districts, cutting costs was the main reason behind the switch. The state’s information manual acknowledges that some schools cut a day from the school week due to the 2008 energy crisis. Spreading like wildfire
As of the 2019-2020 school year, 109 school districts in Colorado, which account for over 60 percent of the state’s school districts, have switched to a shorter schedule. Just one year after District J27 adopted the new schedule, five additional school districts applied to switch. The state department of education’s official manual on the four-day school week reports that this new schedule is immensely popular among students and teachers. Between 80 and 90 percent of community members prefer the four-day school week for many reasons, including more time to spend with family, more time to plan lessons, and increased teacher recruitment and retention rates. Recent studies on the four-day school week found that a shorter school week also improves student performance. One study found that more fourth- and fifth-grade students in rural districts operating on a four-day week scored at the proficient or advanced level in mathematics and reading tests:
“These positive effects…suggest there is little evidence that switching to a four-day week harms student performance,” the study concludes. Consider the students
Students all around the world are feeling the pressure to do well in school. In England, 65 percent of students aged 12 to 16 list school as their primary source of stress, compared to 83 percent of students aged 16 and older. In Australia, 26 percent of kids report school is one of the main sources of their anxiety. In America, students as young as eight years old worry about making good grades and getting into college. School is taking its toll on their lives outside of the classroom, too. Nearly half of American students experience difficulty sleeping, with one in three children experiencing regular headaches. Cutting a day from the school week would give students more time to play, bond with their family and engage in extracurricular activities, including sports, volunteering and working. Consider the parents
Not all parents are thrilled about the change, however – especially those who work on Mondays. To accommodate parents’ need for childcare services and relieve some of the financial burden, daily childcare services provided by District J27 have accompanied the new school week. This service currently costs US$30 per day, but a scholarship is available for low-income families which covers the cost.

Alternative Start Times for Schools
In the U.S., school calendar reform is gaining popularity with more schools experimenting with year round calendars, four-day school weeks, balanced calendars and later start times in an attempt to increase student achievement, cut costs, or improve the overall educational environment for teachers and students. Alternative start times are also in consideration in middle and high schools where teenage students need more sleep than younger students. While more instructional time cannot guarantee improved student achievement, many schools are finding beneficial results by implementing longer school days or longer school years. Many schools use extended learning time to increase the time available for core subject areas by either adding electives or credit recovery programs, making core subject classes longer, adding hours to the school day and even holding periodic Saturday classes. Extended school options can help students advance toward their post-secondary plans because they are allowed more time to earn college credit and gain internship or work experiences. A study on extended time in schools conducted by Massachusetts 2020 in 2005 looked at high performing high schools in Massachusetts and found that of the top performing schools, 50 percent have a school calendar longer than 180 days, and 80 percent have a school week longer than 32.5 hours. It seems that more time in school -- with either more hours in the day or more days of the year -- is positively linked to increased student achievement. Later Start Times
The impact of start times is greater for older students. Evidence links school start times to academic performance, and most studies have found later start times can improve student achievement. Assistant Professor of Economics at Colby College Finley Edwards published his study of start times' effect on middle school students in an article ""Do Schools Begin Too Early?"" The study was conducted in Wake County, North Carolina, as researchers examined how start times affected the performance of students on standardized tests. The results showed that by delaying start times by one hour, students experienced an increase of at least 2 percentage points in math and 1 percentage point in reading. Hormonal changes and increased need for more hours of sleep affect students' performance, so many educational experts feel that later start times would allow students to get more sleep and be more productive throughout the school day. Schools on four-day schedules attend the same amount of days in the year as traditional schedules but have longer school days, attending for an average of eight hours over the traditional 6.5 hours. Benefits to this schedule include increased student and teacher morale, reduced cost in transportation, and additional time for remediation. Drawbacks include childcare concerns and burnout over the course of longer school days. Year Round and Balanced Calendars
Year-round calendars typically follow the start and end times of traditional schedules, but instead of a three month summer break, there are increments of breaks worked into the school year. Most schools follow a 45 days on/15 days off schedule. A balanced calendar schedule reduces the length of the summer break by reapportioning those days throughout the school year. This means more frequent breaks with shorter periods of in-session days. The balanced and year-round calendar still follow the traditional 180 days of instruction, but instead of longer periods of in-session days and longer periods of vacation days, these times are balanced throughout the year to avoid long periods of either in-session or vacation days. These calendars can work, but the problem is that U.S. students are falling behind in global competition with other students. Multiple factors contribute to the falling behind of American students, but reforming the traditional American school calendar and start times could be the answer. - Photos.com/Photos.com/Getty Images

You get just as many days off at a year-round school as you would at a traditional school, just at a year-round school, it’s spreaded out through the year rather than all in one big break (The Pros and Cons of Year-Round School). Short breaks gives time for kids to have a better education and avoids kids getting too board over the long break. Yeah, you wouldn’t get to have 3 week vacations, but who does? Some kids say that they get a break right when they need it and it’s refreshing to them and they’re ready to listen (The Pros and Cons of Year-Round School). It would be easier for them to pick up where they left
Attending school on a year-round calendar or a traditional calendar is a huge debate in the school districts across the United States. It is mainly about which calendar is best for the students’ academics. Everyone is talking about whether to keep the traditional school calendar or switch to year-round school. Year-round schooling is moving away from the traditional three semesters with a long summer break to shorter semesters with more, but shorter holidays. Since this is an ongoing debate, there are both pros and cons of having a change happen. Across the United States lies 37,100 high schools; each school comes in their own shapes and sizes. Educators recently looked into whether or not lowering school size could help better these students. Results found that small high schools contain less violence incidents. Moreover, small high schools result in a wider array of student involvement. Nonetheless, small high schools offer only a limited amount of courses and extracurriculars that students can get involved in. His narrative shows this support and how having instruction in Spanish and English allows him to have higher academics. In less than ten years, one third of students attending public schools will not know English when starting Kindergarten. Are schools and teachers ready for this and will push for bilingual instruction? Is America ready for this? As for now, there is mixed perspectives. schools are experimenting with innovative ways to adapt, including switching to a four-day school week. As many as 100 school districts have implemented a four-day week, especially in Colorado where over one-third of their school districts have adopted this schedule. While you probably aren 't likely to hear students complain about having a three-day weekend every weekend, this potentially offers a lot of advantages: removing a day means spending 20 percent less on things like busing, food, and utilities--in theory. Reports have found actual savings to end up being somewhat paltry, ranging from 0.4 to 2.5 percent per year. Now on, Some critics are concerned that students may not remember the lessons from last week because of the longer weekend and negatively impact students attention during classes. The grades on the report cards in the United States are A-F’s. The A’s on the report card are the best, and it is telling the teacher, you passed that class, but the F’s means you failed. Many of the schools in the United States do not give out E’s as
(“Year-round education: Is summer vacation over... forever?”). This is significant because a great deal of children that had summer vacations before year round schooling have lost it because of year round schooling. Another piece of evidence would be that people are losing educate that they get in summer. 71 percent of adults not just including parents state that kids get educate from lessons during the months of summer by pursuing, working, athletics, or attending camp (“Year-round education: Is summer vacation
Should There Be Year Round School? Studies show that learning in year round school increases less than 1%. There are many reason why there should be year round school, but here are some reasons why there shouldn’t be year round school. Continue reading if you want to know why there shouldn’t be year round school. One reason why there shouldn’t be year round school is because kids need a break from school. Second it messes with students and parents schedule. Plus it ruins summer. Most schools go 180 days a year with breaks in between then you get out and can enjoy your summer June through July. With year round schools you still go the traditional 180 days, of course with breaks in between, but you have to go to school in the summer so all you get off in the summer is June. There are a lot of reasons why you shouldn’t go to a year round school, here are a few.

The discussion in the state legislature about saving money by having school four days a week , or nine days out of ten, warrants serious discussion. After all, as one person noted, we are no longer an agrarian society. Nope, we’re a society where there are lots of two-income households. So if the child is home one day a week, who stays home to watch him or her? This is already a scenario that takes place when a child is sick, if there is a school snow day, or other emergencies. For many households, this becomes a juggling act worthy of the finest circus. It’s fun to assume that “somebody else” will fill in the gap. But who? The Y? Some social service agency? Or, perhaps in some ironic twist, the schools? Of course, the solution that some families have been forced to use is create a society of unsupervised latchkey kids. Hey, it works so well for a couple hours a day, doesn’t it? What’s another few hours? Seriously, such a plan has its benefits in terms of energy savings. My concern, besides the longer school day with less attentiveness and kids who depend on school lunches five days a week, is how the school-home balance beam is navigated.

DUNCAN: We have a significantly shorter school year: 20, 25, 30 days versus India, versus China, other places. Our students are at a competitive disadvantage. BOLDUAN: The major argument for extending school time is summer learning loss. Researchers have found students can lose about a month's worth of achievement during the summer break. ELENA SILVA, SENIOR POLICY ANALYST, EDUCATION SECTOR: It's particularly true for low income kids who don't have the opportunities that other kids have during those big breaks. BOLDUAN: But more time is no silver bullet for reform. Miami-Dade County Schools in Florida used an extended day program for three years, but dropped it because they didn't see improvement in test scores. Critics say it disrupts family life and is expensive. The Miami-Dade program cost more than $100 million. MARTA PEREZ, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD: The teachers were fatigued at the end of the day. The students were fatigued and unmotivated. BOLDUAN: Which is another criticism: It's not just time, but the quality of the extra time that matters. SILVA: One of the risks, of course, is that you end up extending time in school that aren't working well and that's, I think goes without saying that no one wants to extend bad time. (END VIDEO CLIP)
Four-Day School Week
AZUZ: So, year-round school is one idea. What about the opposite: less time in school? That's what a lot of districts are doing, canceling one day of classes and moving to a four-day school week. The reason behind this? Money. For example, schools in Georgia's Peach County needed to cut $800,000. Switching to a four-day week will save about half of that. Less school might sound great to you, but not to everyone. It means parents will have to figure out where their kids will go on the day they're not in school. And remember in that last report, the idea of learning loss when you're not in class? It's the same concern around the four-day week. Before We Go
AZUZ: Well, finally today, we'd like you to unleash your inner-geek. This is something we should all be concerned about: alien invasion! It happened in Atlanta this weekend when DragonCon rolled into town and brought some creative costumes with it. The sci-fi and comic convention always has an interesting cast of characters: Interplanetary predators? Yep. Old-school robots? Uh-huh. People willing to paint their face blue for no apparent reason? Got that too. Even a Sith lord couldn't stay away! AZUZ: We had some ideas for Darth Vader puns, but we didn't want to force anything. Wookie here, we've reached the end of today's show. We will be back again tomorrow. We'll see you then. |Most Viewed||Most Emailed||Top Searches|

The purpose of this qualitative, case study was to understand how the four-day school week influenced a school district in Northern Arizona, over five years. Research Questions 1 through 3 addressed district performance including teacher/staff and student attendance, achievement on the state assessment in reading and math, and costs on utilities. Research Question 4 addressed stakeholder perception. Maslow’s hierarchy of needs theory and collective impact theory served as the foundation for this study. The purposive sample included 40 internal and external stakeholders. Data collected included archival documents, semistructured interviews, and a structured questionnaire. A quantitative trend analysis was conducted on archival documents. Qualitative thematic analysis was conducted on interview perception data and structured questionnaire data was recoded for frequency. Archival data revealed natural gas costs decreased, student attendance improved, teacher/staff attendance declined, math scores dropped, reading scores were flat, and water/electricity costs increased. Perception data revealed stakeholders felt a positive impact on student attendance; saving money on utilities; teacher PD time; part-time employment; family time; and morale and staff retention. Stakeholders felt negatively towards teacher collaboration time; student achievement; the longer school day; lack of structure, supervision, and nutritious meals on the off day; and the Monday federal holidays causing school to be in session only three days per week. Overall, data revealed that while perceptions varied, stakeholders preferred the four-day regardless of any negative impacts to the district. The implications for this study are a resource and lessons learned for district personnel seeking to eliminate a day of instruction for the purposes of saving money. |Commitee:||Griffith, Nathan, McNulty, Charles|

The parents of our students, the staff, the school board, and the entire community of Oakridge reviewed the four-day week for an entire year prior to implementation. Since implementation I have become a four-day week advocate because of all the positive attributes including: better student academic performance, increased teacher vitality, increased student engagement, decreased student discipline problems, and an improvement to the overall culture of excellence for the district. Most school districts originally begin a review of the four-day school week as a strategy to address financial shortfalls. (Mine did not.) By trimming one day off the week, a school can save in bus services, cafeteria, and facilities costs. This can be especially crucial during state budget shortfalls, where K-12 funding can be in danger of cuts, and even more so for rural school districts, which must run their schools on a minimal budget. But not all school districts go to a four-day week because of money, and certainly it is not the only way a school can benefit from the change. The four-day week is not for all districts, and there are negative attributes that need to have alleviation strategies in place prior to implementation. Negative attributes include parent fears of not being able to find child care on Fridays, fatigue for students that have to attend school for longer days, and decreases in compensation for employees who lose hours. An example of an alleviation strategy for the child care concern is the offering of Red Cross Childcare First Aid certification classes for high school students. These students then became available for parents who could not find relatives or other child care on Fridays. Another strategy is offering extra duty employment for bus drivers, cooks, and custodians, who all lose significant hours. In our district we made it a practice to offer all paid athletic supervision and activity duties to the employees who lost work time prior to other employees. Regardless of the negative consequence associated with the four-day week, there are strategies to alleviate the negative impact on students, families and staff. Of note, many parents have found that eliminating the large number of half-days for students that plague five-day weeks — such as teacher work days, curriculum days, grading days, inservice days, etc. — has made finding childcare easier. With the four-day week, teachers can do their non-teaching activities on the day off, and therefore schools do not have to send children home at awkward and inconsistent times. However, what I have found is that most common four-day school week objections are derived more from a fear of change (and a indeed a reasonable concern) rather than empirical study. When scrutinized, these objections are both addressed and debunked by the switch. To demonstrate that point, here are four reasons why the four-day school week is an improvement to the five-day week. Teacher and student attendance increases. Teachers are the key to student learning, and having the regular classroom teacher in the room instead of a substitute teacher is better for kids. Because teachers are able to schedule meetings, doctor’s appointments and other possible conflicts with their teaching schedule on the extra day off, teachers are better able to provide a consistency for students. In Oakridge, the number of available work hours missed by teachers decreased significantly (21.8%) after the move to a four-day school week. Student attendance typically increases, too."", 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:e211e027-e45b-4d40-9de0-8293e4a42775>']}, {'passage': ""Most districts that implement a four-day week see substantial improvement in attendance at the high school level per available instructional hours (they spend more time learning, but less days at school). Attendance in some schools increased 3% as measured against available instructional hours. Contrary to fears, instructional time for students can increase from what it was before if it is the wish of the school district. By subtracting non-teaching activities from Fridays (lunch time, passing periods, transportation time, recess) and adding those paid teacher work hours to instructional hours Monday-Thursday, the amount of paid teacher time that is allocated to instruction increases. Each school day is comprised of many activities that have no direct positive correlation to student academic achievement. The time we pay teachers when they are not teaching includes before school starts (usually about 30 minutes), the time that society pays teachers after school (usually 45 minutes), passing periods (typically six passing periods of five minutes each equals 30 minutes). All of this “non-instructional time” on Fridays is eliminated and that time can be changed to instructional time on the other remaining four days. Also, the flexibility of the four-day week allows it to work around national holidays, so even if a Monday needs to be taken off — say, for Labor Day — students can still go to school for four days (Monday-Friday). The four-day school week offers four days of instruction every week, not the inconsistency of the five-day week which often has only three, three and one-half, or four days of student instruction. This is one of the keys to the four-day week: Instead of sending kids home so that teachers can do non-instructional duties you bring teachers in on Fridays to complete non-instructional tasks! On the four-day week, student discipline decreases and student engagement increases. The commonly assumed reason for the decrease in student discipline is that students are more actively engaged in more strenuous and rigorous classes than on a five-day week. Keep in mind that student seat time typically increases in the move from a five-day week to a four-day week, so claims that student discipline incidents decrease because they are in school for less time is not a viable argument. Also, teachers commonly reflect upon the change from a five-day to a four-day week that students work harder, are engaged more, and learn more. Teachers have noted that there is increased intrinsic motivation to cover material in fewer days with more instructional time, and that students adjust to increased expectations by becoming more engaged. Moreover, the extra instructional time allows teachers to better teach more complicated subjects, which can otherwise be a problem especially in math and sciences. Perhaps most importantly, teacher vitality and morale increases tremendously. Teaching is an extremely difficult job, where it is common for teachers to spend long nights and weekends assessing student work and preparing. Any teacher worth their salt does not work only “to the contract” work hours, but does everything they can in their non-working hours to provide as many learning opportunities for their students as possible. On a five-day week it is not uncommon to see teachers work late on Friday nights grading and assessing the week’s student work. Saturdays are often spent working on preparation for the next week’s worth of lessons, leaving Sundays to reinvigorate and spend time with their families. As a result, teachers often start the school year each September bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, ready to face new challenges. But by February, many become exhausted. The four-day week, even though each instructional day is longer, provides three days for teachers to complete needed work and spend some much-needed time with their families. This simple fact increases teacher morale, decreases teacher turnover, and improves teacher vitality. This leads to happier and more energetic teachers, which results in better education for students. Don't let nostalgia for an antiquated tradition cloud your mind — take a few minutes and read about the four-day week and get the facts. Plan for the negative attributes, maximize the positive attributes, and make sure that the community is thoroughly involved in the implementation process. The best way to ensure the failure of the implementation of the four-day week is to “do it to the community, instead of “doing it with the community.”"", 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:e211e027-e45b-4d40-9de0-8293e4a42775>']}, {'passage': 'Four-Day School Week Is on the Rise, Story Says\nThe idea of a four-day school week is nothing new. It\'s long been embraced by some small, rural school districts. But a new Associated Press story suggests the practice is spreading amid budget pressures on school systems. Featured is a 4,000-student rural district in Peach County, Ga., where school officials reportedly shifted last year to a four-day schedule to help fill a $1 million budget shortfall. What\'s intriguing is that both student attendance and standardized test scores have since improved. (Apparently, each school day is longer to make up for lost time.) Across the country, more than 120 districts operate on a four-day week, the AP story says. (If only employers of education journalists would embrace this idea!) Also, over the past couple of years, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Maine have changed state law so that districts can count their academic year by hour rather than days, so that a four-day week is possible, the story says. Nevertheless, the story also identifies an Oklahoma district that plans to switch back to a five-day week, after school officials decided the approach wasn\'t working well for students or teachers. For a more detailed exploration of a four-day school week, check out this 2008 analysis from the Council on State Governments. Also, I came across a helpful research brief issued last year by the Center for Education Policy, Applied Research, and Evaluation at the University of Southern Maine. It notes that little research has been conducted on the impact of moving to a four-day school week on financial savings, student achievement, or other matters. ""As noted by many observers, the literature that exists on the four-day school\nweek is mainly positive, but not often peer-reviewed or scientifically based, and few summaries of this literature provide any critical analysis of the results,"" the report says. On the question of student achievement, the report says the shorter week does not appear to have a negative effect, but again cautions that much of the literature reviewed was not held to professional scrutiny. One of the most positive and ubiquitous findings from existing research, the report finds, is improved teacher and student attendance. Finally, the University of Southern Maine\'s analysis cautions that the actual financial savings from cutting a day out of the school week doesn\'t always live up to expectations, particularly if personnel costs are not reduced. The savings generally are seen in such areas as transportation, food services, and energy costs.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:39e4263e-6eb5-4a7f-90a9-a501eac204e9>']}, {'passage': 'Driven by hopes of cutting transportation, heating and staff costs, more and more school systems are moving to a four-day school week. Small, rural school districts have been in the vanguard of this trend, but larger urban districts are also making the shift. Right now at least twenty US states have one or more school districts operating on a four-day week, including California, Arizona and Michigan. Though shorter school weeks have been implemented from time to time in the US since the 1930s, and briefly became widespread during the “energy crisis” of the 1970s, definitive studies and reports on the impact of the shortened school week are few. This research brief is one of many that indicate that the change can often improve attendance and morale for both students and teachers. Some proponents even tout improved academic performance; especially where cost savings might forestall teacher layoffs or larger class sizes. (Most evaluations indicate that there is no net effect on achievement, though some reports have shown reduced test scores.) Opponents raise concerns about how long, tiring days in the classroom will affect young children, and point to the burdens placed on working parents to find costly daycare. What is the impact of the four-day week on tutors and tutoring? There may be some downsides the overall effect is likely to be positive. Most encouraging is the fact that some districts instituting a four-day week are explicitly inviting students who need extra help to come to school on their “off day” for tutoring sessions. In some cases, schools are reinvesting the money they’re saving to create tutoring opportunities, such as hiring one-on-one tutors for academic underachievers. Similarly, when the school system in Georgia’s Peach County moved to a four-day week, several community organizations (including Boys and Girls clubs and a church) began offering affordable tutoring on Mondays (their “off day”) for only $10 to $15. Will students have less time and energy after school for tutoring on the days when they attend classes? Some tutors may need to shift their schedules to connect with learners on their off day or on weekends – possibly making for some intensely busy days for tutors. But most schools are pushing dismissal ahead by no more than an hour, while reducing lunch and recess times. So after-school tutoring opportunities might not be adversely impacted. Tutors who connect with students online or “on demand” might benefit from an increase in business as learners move to fit tutoring into their new school-day schedules. For example, tutors who can support “digital learners” who want to learn anytime, anyplace, at their own pace, may take yet more business from traditional tutoring services due to the shorter school week. The “bottom line” for tutors is that shortening the school week can potentially create new opportunities: first by opening up a “tutoring day” on Monday or Friday, and second through increased demand for services in areas where schools are hiring tutors. As always, those who can adapt their offerings to the changing needs of students and their families will be positioned to make the most of the situation. Featured photo courtesy of Jean Valley.

Could a four-day school week help solve these problems? Colorado School District 27J made national news when it officially cut Mondays from its school schedule in August 2018. District 27J receives one of the lowest levels of funding in the Denver metropolitan area and struggles to retain teachers as a result. But since switching to the new schedule, the district has enticed teachers from other districts to transfer to 27J. The transition also added US$1 million back into the district’s operating budget, part of which was spent on a Chromebook for every middle and high school student in the district. Though the new schedule met mixed reviews from parents and community members, studies show the shorter week significantly improves the health and happiness of students and teachers. - Colorado schools must meet a minimum quota of 1,080 hours of instruction each school year. - The average school day on a modified schedule lasts for seven and a half to eight hours, compared to the standard six-hour day. - School districts looking to switch to a schedule of less than 160 days must obtain approval from Colorado’s Commissioner of Education. - Not all schools within a district operate on the same schedule. - Schools on a four-day week schedule can save as much as 20 percent on transportation costs and food service programmes. 4-DAY SCHOOL WEEK: Do you think school districts in Southern California should do this? https://t.co/CFZboAUyeA\n— ABC7 Eyewitness News (@ABC7) 16 May 2019\nA brief history of Colorado’s four-day school week\nIn Colorado, four-day weeks and schedules shorter than 160 days aren’t new. In fact, some Colorado schools have operated on a shorter schedule since the 1980-1981 academic school year. In 1980, a state law was passed that allowed school districts to operate on alternative schedules. That same academic year, three school districts moved to a four-day school week. The following academic year, 12 school districts made the switch. Unsurprisingly, for many school districts, cutting costs was the main reason behind the switch. The state’s information manual acknowledges that some schools cut a day from the school week due to the 2008 energy crisis. Spreading like wildfire\nAs of the 2019-2020 school year, 109 school districts in Colorado, which account for over 60 percent of the state’s school districts, have switched to a shorter schedule. Just one year after District J27 adopted the new schedule, five additional school districts applied to switch. The state department of education’s official manual on the four-day school week reports that this new schedule is immensely popular among students and teachers. Between 80 and 90 percent of community members prefer the four-day school week for many reasons, including more time to spend with family, more time to plan lessons, and increased teacher recruitment and retention rates. Recent studies on the four-day school week found that a shorter school week also improves student performance. One study found that more fourth- and fifth-grade students in rural districts operating on a four-day week scored at the proficient or advanced level in mathematics and reading tests:\n“These positive effects…suggest there is little evidence that switching to a four-day week harms student performance,” the study concludes. Consider the students\nStudents all around the world are feeling the pressure to do well in school. In England, 65 percent of students aged 12 to 16 list school as their primary source of stress, compared to 83 percent of students aged 16 and older. In Australia, 26 percent of kids report school is one of the main sources of their anxiety. In America, students as young as eight years old worry about making good grades and getting into college. School is taking its toll on their lives outside of the classroom, too. Nearly half of American students experience difficulty sleeping, with one in three children experiencing regular headaches. Cutting a day from the school week would give students more time to play, bond with their family and engage in extracurricular activities, including sports, volunteering and working. Consider the parents\nNot all parents are thrilled about the change, however – especially those who work on Mondays. To accommodate parents’ need for childcare services and relieve some of the financial burden, daily childcare services provided by District J27 have accompanied the new school week. This service currently costs US$30 per day, but a scholarship is available for low-income families which covers the cost.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:55f6c900-9897-45b9-9527-40ffb826db95>']}, {'passage': 'Alternative Start Times for Schools\nIn the U.S., school calendar reform is gaining popularity with more schools experimenting with year round calendars, four-day school weeks, balanced calendars and later start times in an attempt to increase student achievement, cut costs, or improve the overall educational environment for teachers and students. Alternative start times are also in consideration in middle and high schools where teenage students need more sleep than younger students. While more instructional time cannot guarantee improved student achievement, many schools are finding beneficial results by implementing longer school days or longer school years. Many schools use extended learning time to increase the time available for core subject areas by either adding electives or credit recovery programs, making core subject classes longer, adding hours to the school day and even holding periodic Saturday classes. Extended school options can help students advance toward their post-secondary plans because they are allowed more time to earn college credit and gain internship or work experiences. A study on extended time in schools conducted by Massachusetts 2020 in 2005 looked at high performing high schools in Massachusetts and found that of the top performing schools, 50 percent have a school calendar longer than 180 days, and 80 percent have a school week longer than 32.5 hours. It seems that more time in school -- with either more hours in the day or more days of the year -- is positively linked to increased student achievement. Later Start Times\nThe impact of start times is greater for older students. Evidence links school start times to academic performance, and most studies have found later start times can improve student achievement. Assistant Professor of Economics at Colby College Finley Edwards published his study of start times\' effect on middle school students in an article ""Do Schools Begin Too Early?"" The study was conducted in Wake County, North Carolina, as researchers examined how start times affected the performance of students on standardized tests. The results showed that by delaying start times by one hour, students experienced an increase of at least 2 percentage points in math and 1 percentage point in reading. Hormonal changes and increased need for more hours of sleep affect students\' performance, so many educational experts feel that later start times would allow students to get more sleep and be more productive throughout the school day. Schools on four-day schedules attend the same amount of days in the year as traditional schedules but have longer school days, attending for an average of eight hours over the traditional 6.5 hours. Benefits to this schedule include increased student and teacher morale, reduced cost in transportation, and additional time for remediation. Drawbacks include childcare concerns and burnout over the course of longer school days. Year Round and Balanced Calendars\nYear-round calendars typically follow the start and end times of traditional schedules, but instead of a three month summer break, there are increments of breaks worked into the school year. Most schools follow a 45 days on/15 days off schedule. A balanced calendar schedule reduces the length of the summer break by reapportioning those days throughout the school year. This means more frequent breaks with shorter periods of in-session days. The balanced and year-round calendar still follow the traditional 180 days of instruction, but instead of longer periods of in-session days and longer periods of vacation days, these times are balanced throughout the year to avoid long periods of either in-session or vacation days. These calendars can work, but the problem is that U.S. students are falling behind in global competition with other students. Multiple factors contribute to the falling behind of American students, but reforming the traditional American school calendar and start times could be the answer. - Photos.com/Photos.com/Getty Images', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:646620f1-abe8-4855-a8a4-4f7a9e18407c>']}, {'passage': ""You get just as many days off at a year-round school as you would at a traditional school, just at a year-round school, it’s spreaded out through the year rather than all in one big break (The Pros and Cons of Year-Round School).

It is mainly about which calendar is best for the students’ academics. Everyone is talking about whether to keep the traditional school calendar or switch to year-round school. Year-round schooling is moving away from the traditional three semesters with a long summer break to shorter semesters with more, but shorter holidays. Since this is an ongoing debate, there are both pros and cons of having a change happen. Across the United States lies 37,100 high schools; each school comes in their own shapes and sizes. Educators recently looked into whether or not lowering school size could help better these students. Results found that small high schools contain less violence incidents. Moreover, small high schools result in a wider array of student involvement. Nonetheless, small high schools offer only a limited amount of courses and extracurriculars that students can get involved in. His narrative shows this support and how having instruction in Spanish and English allows him to have higher academics. In less than ten years, one third of students attending public schools will not know English when starting Kindergarten. Are schools and teachers ready for this and will push for bilingual instruction? Is America ready for this? As for now, there is mixed perspectives. schools are experimenting with innovative ways to adapt, including switching to a four-day school week. As many as 100 school districts have implemented a four-day week, especially in Colorado where over one-third of their school districts have adopted this schedule. While you probably aren 't likely to hear students complain about having a three-day weekend every weekend, this potentially offers a lot of advantages: removing a day means spending 20 percent less on things like busing, food, and utilities--in theory. Reports have found actual savings to end up being somewhat paltry, ranging from 0.4 to 2.5 percent per year. Now on, Some critics are concerned that students may not remember the lessons from last week because of the longer weekend and negatively impact students attention during classes. The grades on the report cards in the United States are A-F’s. The A’s on the report card are the best, and it is telling the teacher, you passed that class, but the F’s means you failed.

Research Question 4 addressed stakeholder perception. Maslow’s hierarchy of needs theory and collective impact theory served as the foundation for this study. The purposive sample included 40 internal and external stakeholders. Data collected included archival documents, semistructured interviews, and a structured questionnaire. A quantitative trend analysis was conducted on archival documents. Qualitative thematic analysis was conducted on interview perception data and structured questionnaire data was recoded for frequency. Archival data revealed natural gas costs decreased, student attendance improved, teacher/staff attendance declined, math scores dropped, reading scores were flat, and water/electricity costs increased. Perception data revealed stakeholders felt a positive impact on student attendance; saving money on utilities; teacher PD time; part-time employment; family time; and morale and staff retention. Stakeholders felt negatively towards teacher collaboration time; student achievement; the longer school day; lack of structure, supervision, and nutritious meals on the off day; and the Monday federal holidays causing school to be in session only three days per week. Overall, data revealed that while perceptions varied, stakeholders preferred the four-day regardless of any negative impacts to the district.

                ""text"": ""Crosscut recently reported on the Eatonville School District's consideration of a four-day school week, which is already being used by two rural school districts with fewer than 150 students in Eastern Washington. During this legislative session, Sen. Randi Becker R-Eatonville, proposed a bill that would allow 20 school districts of up to 2,200 students to use the four-day school week. Here, Don Kordosky, superintendent of Oregon's Oakridge School District, shares his personal experience and insights on making the switch. When considering the switch from a five-day school week to a four-day school week, one need only recall that classic saying: \u201cLess is more.\u201d\nAs superintendent of Oakridge School District in Oregon, I learned this through personal experience when my schools made the switch. Initially, I was against the idea. How could a four-day week possibly be in the best interest of students? But after doing the research and seeing the benefits firsthand, I became a complete supporter. The positives of the four-day week far outweigh the negatives, and the negatives can all be alleviated through well-thought-out strategies. The parents of our students, the staff, the school board, and the entire community of Oakridge reviewed the four-day week for an entire year prior to implementation. Since implementation I have become a four-day week advocate because of all the positive attributes including: better student academic performance, increased teacher vitality, increased student engagement, decreased student discipline problems, and an improvement to the overall culture of excellence for the district. Most school districts originally begin a review of the four-day school week as a strategy to address financial shortfalls. (Mine did not.) By trimming one day off the week, a school can save in bus services, cafeteria, and facilities costs. This can be especially crucial during state budget shortfalls, where K-12 funding can be in danger of cuts, and even more so for rural school districts, which must run their schools on a minimal budget. But not all school districts go to a four-day week because of money, and certainly it is not the only way a school can benefit from the change. The four-day week is not for all districts, and there are negative attributes that need to have alleviation strategies in place prior to implementation. Negative attributes include parent fears of not being able to find child care on Fridays, fatigue for students that have to attend school for longer days, and decreases in compensation for employees who lose hours. An example of an alleviation strategy for the child care concern is the offering of Red Cross Childcare First Aid certification classes for high school students. These students then became available for parents who could not find relatives or other child care on Fridays. Another strategy is offering extra duty employment for bus drivers, cooks, and custodians, who all lose significant hours. In our district we made it a practice to offer all paid athletic supervision and activity duties to the employees who lost work time prior to other employees. Regardless of the negative consequence associated with the four-day week, there are strategies to alleviate the negative impact on students, families and staff. Of note, many parents have found that eliminating the large number of half-days for students that plague five-day weeks \u2014 such as teacher work days, curriculum days, grading days, inservice days, etc. \u2014 has made finding childcare easier. With the four-day week, teachers can do their non-teaching activities on the day off, and therefore schools do not have to send children home at awkward and inconsistent times. However, what I have found is that most common four-day school week objections are derived more from a fear of change (and a indeed a reasonable concern) rather than empirical study. When scrutinized, these objections are both addressed and debunked by the switch. To demonstrate that point, here are four reasons why the four-day school week is an improvement to the five-day week. Teacher and student attendance increases. Teachers are the key to student learning, and having the regular classroom teacher in the room instead of a substitute teacher is better for kids. Because teachers are able to schedule meetings, doctor\u2019s appointments and other possible conflicts with their teaching schedule on the extra day off, teachers are better able to provide a consistency for students. In Oakridge, the number of available work hours missed by teachers decreased significantly (21.8%) after the move to a four-day school week. Student attendance typically increases, too."",

                ""text"": ""Benefits of Year Round School\nThe year round school system for educational establishments has been in use for a very long time. It is basically a 10-month routine where students go to their various schools for 9 weeks followed by three weeks of break. Further down are benefits of year round school. 1. Eliminates long holidays\nThe year round school system is designed to function without lengthy fall or summer breaks like traditional systems. Rather than long holidays, students are only given a period of three weeks to enjoy their holiday. 2. Places more emphasis on studies\nStudents should be capable of getting the most out of their daily studies. When education establishments follow an agricultural kind of calendar, students do not maximize on their studying time. Most of the problems that are associated with non-year round institutions are minimized or eliminated through having all the students attending school all through the year. 3. Academic benefits\nExperts in the field of education believe that students are greatly benefited with regards to academics because of the short break periods. This is because there is no need of re-learning old material that might have been forgotten after long holidays. Teachers can also get more work done in the year round system, thereby increasing their efficiency. 4. Financial benefits\nYear round school system encourages a significant reduction in costs of child care. This is a great benefit to most parents, especially during the current tough economic climate. A major complaint concerning non-year round institutions is supervision of children throughout the summer period. Parents are forced to locate adequate childcare during this period, which can be very costly. However, this requirement is eliminated in year round schools and thus saves parents lots of money. Nevertheless, upkeep of school buildings can be very inconvenient to undertake since students are in school throughout the year."",

                ""text"": ""Four-Day School Week Is on the Rise, Story Says\nThe idea of a four-day school week is nothing new. It's long been embraced by some small, rural school districts. But a new Associated Press story suggests the practice is spreading amid budget pressures on school systems. Featured is a 4,000-student rural district in Peach County, Ga., where school officials reportedly shifted last year to a four-day schedule to help fill a $1 million budget shortfall. What's intriguing is that both student attendance and standardized test scores have since improved. (Apparently, each school day is longer to make up for lost time.) Across the country, more than 120 districts operate on a four-day week, the AP story says. (If only employers of education journalists would embrace this idea!) Also, over the past couple of years, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Maine have changed state law so that districts can count their academic year by hour rather than days, so that a four-day week is possible, the story says. Nevertheless, the story also identifies an Oklahoma district that plans to switch back to a five-day week, after school officials decided the approach wasn't working well for students or teachers. For a more detailed exploration of a four-day school week, check out this 2008 analysis from the Council on State Governments. Also, I came across a helpful research brief issued last year by the Center for Education Policy, Applied Research, and Evaluation at the University of Southern Maine. It notes that little research has been conducted on the impact of moving to a four-day school week on financial savings, student achievement, or other matters. \""As noted by many observers, the literature that exists on the four-day school\nweek is mainly positive, but not often peer-reviewed or scientifically based, and few summaries of this literature provide any critical analysis of the results,\"" the report says. On the question of student achievement, the report says the shorter week does not appear to have a negative effect, but again cautions that much of the literature reviewed was not held to professional scrutiny. One of the most positive and ubiquitous findings from existing research, the report finds, is improved teacher and student attendance. Finally, the University of Southern Maine's analysis cautions that the actual financial savings from cutting a day out of the school week doesn't always live up to expectations, particularly if personnel costs are not reduced. The savings generally are seen in such areas as transportation, food services, and energy costs."",

This task will just be to list all customers within your organization. While ultimately very simple, it should serve as a foundational basis to perform even the more complicated API calls. N.B. These examples will not work as is, they are meant to be updated with your organization's particular configuration. Base Request URLs:
For the purposes of providing visual cues, we'll be using the POSTMAN
Application to perform this guided tutorial. Exact endpoints and code samples
are provided in the full API document, and will be linked with each sample. You can download POSTMAN from the link below:
Once downloaded, you'll need to setup the calls that we'll be using. We've
provided Postman Profiles to speed up this process. Please download the following files:

I have been unsuccessful in closing the incident via API ; In the python code it states I need a “SERVICE_KEY” , I know I can get this via Configuration > Services > Service Details > Integrations:
However, since this is an email integration there is no (32 char) “KEY” only the email that PD generates … which I cannot use to make the call . How can I resolve incidents via API with this type of integration ? Is there a step I am missing to get a “SERVICE_KEY” for an email integration ? Thanks for your time!

API stands for application programming interface. You can think of an API as a way for one application to communicate to another. In order for you, or other applications to interface with Recurly, you'll need to use an API key. You can think of an API key as a password, which Recurly uses to help identify the program making the request. If you want to set up an integration with your Recurly account, chances are high that you'll need to generate an API key. Users with Manager permissions can generate and view their own API keys. Users with Admin permissions can also see API keys for other account users. Below, you'll learn how to grab an existing API key or generate a new one. - As a developer or Admin user, navigate to Integrations > API Keys. - Navigate to the bottom of the screen and click the Add Private API Key button
- Add a name for your API key, any notes about what it will be used for, and a third-party application for which the application applies. - Click Save Changes. If you would like to revoke an API key, you can do so by following the steps below. We recommend that you revoke your API key if you have any reason to believe the security of the key may be compromised. As a developer or Admin user, navigate to Developers > API Keys. Find the key you would like to revoke. You have three options: revoke the key permanently, to regenerate the key immediately, or to regenerate the key within 12 hours. If you revoke the key, we will not create another key, and it will immediately stop working. All applications that have access to Recurly via that key will immediately cease to have access. If you regenerate a key immediately, the old key will stop working, and Recurly will issue you a new API key. All applications that have access to Recurly via the old key will immediately cease to have access, and we recommend that you update applications with the new key. If you need a Base64 encoded API key, you can copy from Recurly without having to convert yourself. Go to Integrations > API Credentials in Recurly and click to expand ""Need help using the API Key?"". Your Base64 encoded API key is the characters after ""Authorization: Basic""
Regenerate after 12 hours
If you choose this option, the old key is still valid for 12 hours, and Recurly will generate a new key. This will allow you time to update applications using the old key to the new key. During the 12-hour period, applications using the old key will not be affected and will be able to authenticate as if nothing has changed. When 12 hours passes, the old key will no longer function. API keys grant full access to your Recurly account and should be protected the same way you would protect your password. In particular, there are a few common scenarios to keep in mind when working with API keys. - Give each integration its own API key, and assign labels to each key so you know which key goes with which application. If a specific API key is compromised, you can disable that key without disabling access to all of your other integrations. - Be careful not to expose the key to the public (such as in screenshots, videos, or help documentation). Remember that blurring your data isn't always enough. It's best to use ""cut"" functions in your graphics program to remove the data completely. - If a key needs to be shared, generate a new key and label it accordingly so it can be disabled, if needed. Never email the API key, because it would allow access to your Recurly account if hackers were to compromise your email account. - If you revoke a user's access to your Recurly account, any API keys created by the user will be removed from your account. If you require further support, please contact Recurly Support and we will be happy to assist you. Updated 9 months ago

Pipeline building checklist
Learn what you should look for before deploying a pipeline
To ensure the safety and efficiency of your integration flows, you should always review the following points before deploying a pipeline:
By default, for security reasons, the Digibee Integration Platform only allows the use of these triggers along with an API key. To create an API key:
- 1.Go to Configurations;
- 2.Click on Consumers;
- 3.Choose the desired environment;
- 4.Click on CREATE. Create a different API key for each system that consumes an API, and restrict access only to the desired pipelines. Although we strongly advise against it, if you wish to publish a pipeline with the aforementioned triggers without an API key, send us a request via Intercom using the following template:
I request the inclusion of the following pipelines in the whitelist not to use an API Key. - Realm name
- Name of the pipeline(s) to be included in the realm’s whitelist
- Reason for the request
If you use a username and password to access a service in an integration flow, don’t expose them in a component’s configuration settings. Instead, store the login and password on the Accounts page and refer to them in the component settings. Whenever possible, use HTTPS instead of HTTP requests when accessing an external service in your integration flows. Additionally, be sure to clear the Object Store periodically. Object Stores are auxiliary databases that help you develop integration flows. They are not intended to store large amounts of data. If you don’t clear your Object Store periodically, it can cause errors in your integration flows. If you find yourself in a situation where you think you should use the Script component, contact our team. Maybe we can suggest a solution using our components. If you use a component in your pipeline to make a request to an external service, such as an API or database, check that the response type matches the expectations for that request. If it does not, make sure to take an action, such as reprocessing or generating an error. Last modified 9mo ago

I've been doing a lot of work with Livecode and APIs. Here's what I'd suggest doing. Get the API calls working outside of Livecode in a tool designed to let you exercise the API calls. My tool of choice is Postman. Look it up on Google and have at it. There's a bit of a learning curve but once you figure out all the options (and there are lots), it's pretty easy to take a curl syntax and get it up and running in Postman. Postman can even generate code for you to make the call in some common languages (sadly not Livecode). Using Postman guarantees that you figure out how the API is supposed to work before you introduce Livecode. Once you get a few curl API calls going in LC, you'll be amazed at how quickly you can wrap an entire API library up in LC function calls. Now that you've got the calls working in Postman, move to LC (if you can't get the API working in Postman, DO NOT move to Livecode). Make sure you set the headers to be what you had in Postman. Make sure you know whether the API call is a Post or a Get. For username/password, you can set the Authorization header as suggested, you may need to include the username/password in the url. If this is the case look up POST in the LC Dictionary to read about the nuances of this. Code: Select all
post someData to URL ""https://username:firstname.lastname@example.org/""
(make sure you always use https
I've used APIs where the authorization is included in a JSON or XML payload that is sent in the data of the request (this is dependent on the API definition). The API spec should tell you how to authorize your request. Postman really is an invaluable tool to verify the parameters needed for the API call, then it's a matter of translating the syntax into LC.

As part of the installation process, you'll set the password for the root user. This information will go into your Rails app's
database.yml file in the future. sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev
libmysqlclient-dev gives you the necessary files to compile the
mysql2 gem which is what Rails will use to connect to MySQL when you setup your Rails app. When you're finished, you can skip to the Final Steps. Setting Up PostgreSQL
For PostgreSQL, we're going to add a new repository to easily install a recent version of Postgres. sudo sh -c ""echo 'deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ xenial-pgdg main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list"" wget --quiet -O - http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add - sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install postgresql-common sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.5 libpq-dev
The postgres installation doesn't setup a user for you, so you'll need to follow these steps to create a user with permission to create databases. Feel free to replace
chris with your username. sudo -u postgres createuser chris -s # If you would like to set a password for the user, you can do the following sudo -u postgres psql postgres=# \password chris
And now for the moment of truth. Let's create your first Rails application:
#### If you want to use SQLite (not recommended) rails new myapp #### If you want to use MySQL rails new myapp -d mysql #### If you want to use Postgres # Note that this will expect a postgres user with the same username # as your app, you may need to edit config/database.yml to match the # user you created earlier rails new myapp -d postgresql # Move into the application directory cd myapp # If you setup MySQL or Postgres with a username/password, modify the # config/database.yml file to contain the username/password that you specified # Create the database rake db:create rails server
You can now visit http://localhost:3000 to view your new website! Now that you've got your machine setup, it's time to start building some Rails applications. If you received an error that said
Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO) then you need to update your config/database.yml file to match the database username and password. I've been googling for a proper and simple installation of Rails on Ubuntu and have used yours because it worked. But... So many shortcuts. Installation of Curl, Git, Node, Yarn all in one script, no explanation. Ccould you at least divide and try to explain the installation process? Like dividing the installation of Curl, GIT and explaining the ff:
1) why we need Node and Yarn for RoR? 2) the libraries downloaded. 3) The need for global variables
So much copy and paste and little explanation. The way to do it is edit the configuration file:
sudo gedit /etc/postgresql/POSTGRE_VERSION/main/pg_hba.conf
And change all methods to trust. Restart postgres service. This way no password must be provided in the database.yml.

I am trying to use API Explorer (REST API/ SPoT API ) but I cant figure out the sequence of the API to use ? After Server setup I tried API Explorer, only api_keys other api like venu,location etc
could u please let me know how I can use Try it Now button for the api Explorer ? for SPoT API s
I need the sequence of API commands I can use when using from java code implementation

In order for OBIEE to connect with Salesforce.com, you will need to have an ODBC driver as well as SFDC setup correctly. In this post, I will go through the required setup for Salesforce.com There are 2 main areas you will need to cover in SFDC before we begin setting up ODBC driver. - Option 1: Using Security Token
- Permission Set – API Enabled
- Assign Permission to Users
- Security Token Reset
- Option 2: Using Trusted IP
- Network Access
- Trusted IP Ranges
With Option 1, you will not need to trust any particular IP addresses. However, when ODBC connects, connection will require username, password as well as the security token generated by SFDC. This may not be accepted by the end user as they will need to enter a security token every time. It may sound secure, but I’m pretty sure the end user will keep the password and security token in a notepad and just copy and paste everytime they log in. No so safe after all. Using Option 2, the machine hosting OBIEE can be trusted using Trusted IP Range. This way, security token is not needed. Hoping that you have already filled in the poll from the Introduction post and excited to get started. If you haven’t already filled in, you can do it here too.I will walk through both options and you can decide which one is really needed. Personally, I would go for Option 2 Trusted IP and would make life a lot simpler. Option 1: Using Security Token
Permission Set – API Enabled
You will need to create a Permission Set with API Enabled checked. To do this, you will need to go to Setup -> Manage Users -> Permission Sets Click New to create a new permission set. I named it APIPerm. Then click System Permissions and Edit. Check API Enabled then save. Assigning Permission Set
Continuing from above, go to Manager Users -> Users Select the user for this permission. Scroll down until you see Permission Set Assignments and add the Permission Set you have just created for him/her. Security Token Reset
Security Token is emailed to the user. So if the security token is lost or to be safe, you like to receive a new one, you can always reset the security token. Go to My Settings Click Reset Security Token under Personal. Click Reset Security Token. You will receive your security token through your email. A sample of the email is below. If your password is “mypassword” and your security token is “XXXX” you must enter “mypasswordXXXX” in place of your password. Keep good hold of your security token as we will use this in Part 2. Option 2: Using Trusted IP
Getting Hold of OBIEE Server IP Address
You will need to know OBIEE Server IP Address. Hopefully it’s a static address. Go to http://whatismyip.com/. This website will give you the IP address of the computer that you are using at that moment. So make sure you are using the server to connect to the website. Adding Trusted IP Range to SFDC
- Follow the click path of: Setup -> Admin Setup -> Security Controls -> Network Access. - Click on the New button. - Enter a valid IP address in the Start IP Address field and the same or a higher IP address in the End IP Address field. - The start and end addresses define the range of allowable IP addresses from which users can log in. If you want to allow logins from a single IP address, enter the same address in both fields. - Enter a description and Click on the Save button. Your SFDC setup is now ready for connecting from an ODBC driver which will be my next post.

Setting Up PostgreSQL\nFor PostgreSQL, we\'re going to add a new repository to easily install a recent version of Postgres. sudo sh -c ""echo \'deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ xenial-pgdg main\' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list"" wget --quiet -O - http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add - sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install postgresql-common sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.5 libpq-dev\nThe postgres installation doesn\'t setup a user for you, so you\'ll need to follow these steps to create a user with permission to create databases.

Let\'s create your first Rails application:\n#### If you want to use SQLite (not recommended) rails new myapp #### If you want to use MySQL rails new myapp -d mysql #### If you want to use Postgres # Note that this will expect a postgres user with the same username # as your app, you may need to edit config/database.yml to match the # user you created earlier rails new myapp -d postgresql # Move into the application directory cd myapp # If you setup MySQL or Postgres with a username/password, modify the # config/database.yml file to contain the username/password that you specified # Create the database rake db:create rails server\nYou can now visit http://localhost:3000 to view your new website! Now that you\'ve got your machine setup, it\'s time to start building some Rails applications. If you received an error that said\nAccess denied for user \'root\'@\'localhost\' (using password: NO) then you need to update your config/database.yml file to match the database username and password.

In this post, I will go through the required setup for Salesforce.com There are 2 main areas you will need to cover in SFDC before we begin setting up ODBC driver. - Option 1: Using Security Token\n- Permission Set – API Enabled\n- Assign Permission to Users\n- Security Token Reset\n- Option 2: Using Trusted IP\n- Network Access\n- Trusted IP Ranges\nWith Option 1, you will not need to trust any particular IP addresses. However, when ODBC connects, connection will require username, password as well as the security token generated by SFDC. This may not be accepted by the end user as they will need to enter a security token every time. It may sound secure, but I’m pretty sure the end user will keep the password and security token in a notepad and just copy and paste everytime they log in. No so safe after all. Using Option 2, the machine hosting OBIEE can be trusted using Trusted IP Range. This way, security token is not needed. Hoping that you have already filled in the poll from the Introduction post and excited to get started. If you haven’t already filled in, you can do it here too.I will walk through both options and you can decide which one is really needed. Personally, I would go for Option 2 Trusted IP and would make life a lot simpler. Option 1: Using Security Token\nPermission Set – API Enabled\nYou will need to create a Permission Set with API Enabled checked. To do this, you will need to go to Setup -> Manage Users -> Permission Sets Click New to create a new permission set. I named it APIPerm. Then click System Permissions and Edit. Check API Enabled then save. Assigning Permission Set\nContinuing from above, go to Manager Users -> Users Select the user for this permission. Scroll down until you see Permission Set Assignments and add the Permission Set you have just created for him/her. Security Token Reset\nSecurity Token is emailed to the user. So if the security token is lost or to be safe, you like to receive a new one, you can always reset the security token. Go to My Settings Click Reset Security Token under Personal. Click Reset Security Token. You will receive your security token through your email. A sample of the email is below. If your password is “mypassword” and your security token is “XXXX” you must enter “mypasswordXXXX” in place of your password. Keep good hold of your security token as we will use this in Part 2. Option 2: Using Trusted IP\nGetting Hold of OBIEE Server IP Address\nYou will need to know OBIEE Server IP Address. Hopefully it’s a static address. Go to http://whatismyip.com/. This website will give you the IP address of the computer that you are using at that moment. So make sure you are using the server to connect to the website. Adding Trusted IP Range to SFDC\n- Follow the click path of: Setup -> Admin Setup -> Security Controls -> Network Access. - Click on the New button. - Enter a valid IP address in the Start IP Address field and the same or a higher IP address in the End IP Address field. - The start and end addresses define the range of allowable IP addresses from which users can log in. If you want to allow logins from a single IP address, enter the same address in both fields. - Enter a description and Click on the Save button. Your SFDC setup is now ready for connecting from an ODBC driver which will be my next post.

Getting out with your dog and enjoying the warm weather is the ultimate reward after being trapped inside all winter with a bored dog. From lake visits and dog friendly patios to hiking the Metroparks, if you have an active dog, you (and your dog) have no excuse to be bored during the summer months.
In addition to all of the outdoor activities you can do with your dog, local rescue groups host a number of fun dog friendly events throughout the summer. Here are the Top 5 Dog Friendly Events this summer you don’t want to miss:
Bring your dog along to watch you sip on some wine and tour the vineyards of Grand River Cellars in Madison. Held on June 13, Woof, Wag and Wine includes a tour of the winery, live music and auctions. Admission is $20 a person (which includes a Muddy Paws wine sampling) and proceeds go to the Lake Humane Society.
Although the Indians aren’t doing their Puppypalooza event this year, you still have some opportunities to take your dog to a baseball game. Both the Lake Erie Captains and the Akron Rubber Ducks hold dog friendly nights. The Lake Erie Captains will hold their Bark at the Park on July 28, August 11 and August 23, and the Akron Rubber Ducks’ dog friendly games will be June 10 and August 19. A portion of the proceeds from each game will benefit local rescue groups.
The largest dog friendly event in Ohio, Canine Fun Days, is held every August at the Metroparks Polo Fields in Moreland Hills. This two day party for dogs and their people is organized by Greyhound Adoption of Ohio and includes swimming, dock diving, contests and more. This year’s event will be held August 16 and 17th.
Every Tuesday throughout the summer Tremont Taphouse hosts a dog friendly Yappy Hour to benefit local rescue groups. Bring your dog along for some patio time while you enjoy the Taphouse’s large selection of beer and delicious food. Adoptable dogs will also make appearances, so bring your dog-less friends along to meet their new best friend! Several other bars and wineries host Yappy Hours throughout the summer as well; check out my dog friendly events calendar for other upcoming dates.
This annual event, Dog Paddle and Pet-a-Palooza, is held at the Hinckley Reservation to benefit the Cleveland APL and the Medina County SPCA. Bring your dog to enjoy a swim at Ledge Pool as well as a mini dog fair including vendors and exhibitors. Also, dogs are allowed on rowboats at Hinckley Reservation, so if your dog doesn’t enjoy swimming you can rent a rowboat and take him for a boat ride instead.

Except Cleveland is a city with its own swagger, and a cost of living so low that Stockham said, ""You can buy a house for less than a car, and you should never pay full retail price for anything here."" Also: Cleveland is the place for a hipster hotdog hangout that puts Froot Loops on its dogs, a brewery that has residents lining up for Christmas-spiced beer, and one of the world's best symphony orchestras. Come hungry, and let Stockham be your guide. Where should we stay? If you stay downtown, you can't go wrong. My favorite is Wallace Manor Bed and Breakfast in Ohio City; it’s a beautiful old, Victorian-era building that was recently renovated. The owners are super friendly and take care of people really well. We also have a Westin downtown that’s attached to Urban Farmer, a steakhouse that sources what it can locally. Other hotels to consider: the Metropolitan at the Nine, a luxury hotel-condo-restaurant complex, which is new, and a big deal for Cleveland; the new Hilton; and the Drury Hotel, because it’s in a converted school district administration building and is all marble. Where should we grab breakfast? Urban Farmer has a great brunch. But the real place to go is Jack Flaps. Their pancakes are freaking amazing. Everyone raves about a short stack of the lemon curd pancakes, but I love the Benedicto Mexicano, which has cornbread, chorizo, gravy, crema, and sunny side up eggs. Best cup of coffee? Rising Star, of course. Then Six Shooter Coffee, a local roaster, is in the Waterloo neighborhood nearest the best wood-fired pizza in town, Citizen Pie. Pour Cleveland is a multi-roaster. Vintage Tea and Coffee is also good. Best place to see great art? The Cleveland Museum of Art is nothing short of amazing. Not only is it one of the few free museums remaining in the country, but it has Rodin’s Thinker and one of Monet’s water lilies. Nobody talks about how unbelievable it is. Also, the covered atrium there is one of the most beautiful places in town. Best market to eat your way around? West Side Market. It celebrated its 100 year anniversary a few years ago. There are fish, meat, spice, and produce vendors. If you want spices, try Urban Herbs. Then try Rooted in Cleveland for local produce and pour-over coffee. The other two I love are the crepe stand and also a fishmonger called Kate’s Fish, which is notable because we're not near water and the fish they sell is excellent. Best old-school Cleveland restaurant institution? Pier W is the old standby with the best seafood in all of Northeast Ohio; it overlooks the lake. The other one would be Johnny’s, a downtown fancy steakhouse restaurant that’s been there for several decades. But the Cleveland institution everyone raves about is Sokolowski’s. We have a large Eastern European population here, and this is THE place to get pierogies, cabbage, and the like. Hottest new restaurant in town? First, Mabel’s BBQ. It’s a Michael Symon project that’s reimagining Cleveland-style barbecue. Then there’s The Proper Pig. The Southern Café serves awesome Southern food. Also, I’m most excited about The Arcadian, which is trying to get as close to farm to table as it possibly can. On the more upscale end, there’s a French restaurant called L’Albatros that is absolutely to die for. I also should mention Happy Dog in Gordon Square. It’s a hipster hot dog hangout that serves great beer and a hot dog menu with wacky toppings like Sriracha, Froot Loops, and peanut butter. Which restaurants do you frequent? Superior Pho for one serves hands down the best pho in town. Then Caribe Bake Shop, which is a Latin American food restaurant that isn’t exactly a bakery the way its name says.

Mankind’s infatuation with canine companionship is nothing new. In fact, it was unabashed dog lover King Frederick of Prussia that first coined the phrase “man’s best friend” back in 1789. These three small words have since described a millenia-long bond between man and dog; a bond that has become increasingly strong with the passing of time. For modern-day dog owners, “man’s best friend” is a comrade to be included in every aspect of life. We buy fashionable outfits for our pups. We create social media accounts for our furry friends, proudly sharing images of our pets just as first-time parents would. And now, dog lovers can rejoice over the emergence of drinking establishments that are not only dog-friendly, but dog-centric. In this pup-friendly bar trend Neptune Beach’s own BrewHound Dog Park + Bar and Riverside’s Kanine Social are leading the pack. Just weeks ago, Lauren Wyckoff and Jason Underwood opened the doors (gates?) of BrewHound Dog Park + Bar. “We were visiting Orlando and got to thinking, if you can bring your kid to a waterpark and have a drink, why can’t you go somewhere to have a beer with your dog?” reasons Wyckoff. “At the time, we hadn’t heard of anywhere where you could do that.”
The duo then set out to create a community-driven space filled with pups and local libations. “Our main goal was to get people together enjoying something outdoors so that they can have a greater appreciation of the environment,” says Wyckoff, who, along with Underwood is a self-proclaimed outdoor enthusiast. “When people visit the park, they’re engaging and meeting with people, which is what it’s all about.”
Featuring lots of rustic decor, BrewHound offers its two-legged customers a rotating variety of local craft beers, wine on tap, and Bold Bean specialty coffee. Owners can sip and stroll with their furry friends in “The Yard,” BrewHound’s off-leash dog park with daily, monthly, and annual memberships available. If you’re a dog-lover in search of a brew closer to downtown, College Street’s Kanine Social welcomes pups and owners alike to sit and stay for a cool beverage. Owners Daniel Moffatt and Dustin Fries opened Kanine in 2017, becoming Jax’s first boutique doggie daycare and private dog park to pair with a craft beer and coffee bar. “We first talked about the idea of opening a dog park and bar four or five years ago,” Moffatt explains. “We were always looking for a place where we could bring our dogs, enjoy a beer and watch a football game.”
Kanine’s taproom is open to the public, serving up beer on tap, wine, and ciders, while patron’s pups can avail themselves of some off-leash exercise. These amenities are paired with Kanine Social’s dog daycare. “Our concept allows them [patrons] the freedom to let their dogs run and play,” says Moffatt. “While enjoying a beer and having time to meet up with old friends or make new friends.”
Though Kanine Social hasn’t been open to the public for quite a year yet, Moffatt and Fries have their eyes set toward opening a second location in the next 18-24 months.

Dogs are welcome, at least under certain circumstances, in more places with each passing year. A number of parks, schools, hotels and hospitals now allow dogs, and a wide variety of businesses let both employees and customers bring their dogs with them. There are still a lot of places that are off limits to our four-legged family members, and this continues to affect most people with dogs. I was recently at a local bookstore that allows dogs, but the café inside the store is for people only. There is a very nice sign saying that health codes prohibit them from welcoming dogs to the café, though they are welcome in the rest of the store. The staff works very hard to accommodate people who have brought their dog to the bookstore and would like a cup of coffee by bringing their orders out of the café and into the main part of the bookstore. I’m sure many dog guardians skip the café because they can’t sit down and enjoy a drink if accompanied by a dog. However, many people do request “delivery” to the main part of the store, and seem appreciative of the option. Years ago I worked with a woman who would hardly go anywhere without her dog. She brought him to work, which was allowed as we worked at a facility that provided dog training, dog grooming and dog day care. This woman never went to the movies because her dog was not allowed to go with her, and never ate in restaurants for the same reason. She made some concessions to practicality such as going to the grocery store or on other errands alone, but she generally only went where her dog was allowed to come, too. She made decisions that many could consider extreme, but they certainly worked for her and for her dog. Her social life was affected by her unwillingness to go places without her dog, but she has always been very happy with her choices and has a good life. Are there any places you don’t go because of restrictions that prevent your dog from coming, too?

It’s the end of the summer and you want to get away. However, you don’t want to leave your furry friend at home. So, where are the best places to go with your pooch in the US? Reviews.com reached out to Nature Reflections in response to our blog post Have Car, Have Dog, Let’s Have an Adventure with a great article on places to travel with your dog. Not only does their article explore the top 10 places but they do a deep dive of the most dog friendly towns throughout the US. It is a must read for any dog lover that likes to travel with their companion. By Jackie Nelson- Feature Writer
The U.S. is full of incredible places to visit, but if you’re planning to take along your furry family member, there are some important things to consider. Outdoor recreation, lodging, and even dining take on added importance when planning a trip with your dog. It’s also safe to say a dog-friendly destination would have some type of doggie daycare and good access to veterinary care in case of emergency. Overall, having good amenities for your pup can make or break your entire experience. We spent over 150 hours researching what makes the best vacation spot and came up with 100 top locations out of 567 possible destinations to visit with your dog. And why did we do all this? Because we want to help people research and find the best places to visit that don’t require leaving Fido behind. We determined the top cities to visit with your dog by scrutinizing and cutting from a total of 1,000 of the biggest tourist destinations across the country according to TripAdvisor and Touropia. Using population density, we were able to filter out highly populated metropolitan areas full of traffic, concrete, and crowds – definitely not conducive to a doggone good time. Next, we graded the frontrunners against seven crucial criteria that would helped a city rank higher on our list. These factors included: number of dog parks, availability of dog trails, amount of dog-friendly restaurants, options for dog-friendly lodging, nearby dog-friendly beaches, availability of dog daycares, and nearby veterinarians or emergency clinics. Based on this research, we grouped those factors into two different city scores: amenities and outdoor activities. We also talked to three experts who provided additional information about traveling with your dog:
- Erin Ballinger, the destinations editor at BringFido, offered essential tips for exploring the world with a pup. - Suzanne Bryner of Lucky Fido Dog Training recommended training techniquesto turn your dog into a great travel companion. - And Kathleen Darling, the Infection Prevention Coordinator at Texas A&M University Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, explained how to make traveling a safe and healthy adventure for your pup. What We Learned
In our research, we discovered a majority of our most dog-friendly destinations are in the southeast United States. If you’re traveling in the summer months, Darling recommends limiting time outside and making sure your pup has plenty of water. We awarded honorable mentions for the most dog trails, most dog parks, the most dog-friendly beaches, the most dog daycares, and the most dog-friendly restaurants. We also had to figure out just the right approach to weighing certain aspects of a destination against another. For example, we determined outdoor activities to be a significant factor for those considering where to visit with their dog. This resulted in a place like Nantucket, Massachusetts, earning an overall high score (and making the top 10) despite having relatively few pet-friendly amenities, since it does have such great outdoor activities.

This search will also help you identify some pet-friendly dining options before you ever leave home. If few options exist, create a backup plan: Will the hotel allow you to leave your pet crated in the hotel room? Or can you order in food or even prepare your own meals in your room? Regardless of where you’re traveling, be sure to comply with local leash laws and always clean up after your pet as a courtesy to others who are sharing the public or private space. Prep Your Hosts
If you’re planning to stay with a family or friend along the way, be upfront about your pet’s needs so there are no surprises. You’ll also need to ask about the house rules:
- Are pets allowed on the furniture? - Can dogs do their business in the yard, or would your hosts prefer that you go for a morning and evening walk? - Is the yard fenced? - Do your friends have other animals in the home? Do they have kids? - Is there a safe room for your pet to stay if you leave the house, or will you need to bring along a crate? - All of these questions will help make your stay more peaceful and comfortable for everyone. Choose Your Mode of Transportation
Many traditional travel options are off limits to pets. Here are some considerations when planning your trip:
Rental cars: The majority of rental car agencies have pet-friendly policies and allow dogs and cats in the car. Some may require your pet to be crated during travel, and agencies may apply extra fees for any damage or necessary cleaning. Buses: Certain cities like Seattle have pet-friendly policies that allow leashed dogs on public transportation. But most national bus chains don’t allow animals. Subways: Check your local destinations for their pet policies. Some subways allow leashed or contained animals to ride when accompanied by their owner. Ferry lines: Most ferry lines allow pets on board if they remain with their humans in the car, and some have adopted policies that allow animals in specific areas of the vessel. Trains: Most trains will not allow pets on board or in cargo areas. However, there are always exceptions. Certain European countries have more open travel options for pets. Cruises: While many small carriers offer one- to three-hour “sightseeing” cruises for people and their pets, animals aren’t traditionally welcome on ocean liners. One exception is Cunard’s Queen Mary 2, which offers a transatlantic voyage starting or ending in New York, as well as European voyages. The ship boasts an onboard kennel area for housing dogs and cats, space for walking dogs, and designated areas for guests to spend time with their pets. Airlines: Each airline has its own restrictions and fees when it comes to transporting pets, and the size of your pet is a big consideration. Small pets traveling in the cabin will need to fit within the seat space. If your pet is too big to fit under the seat, you’ll need an airline-approved crate with proper ventilation for transporting your pal in one of the plane’s climate-controlled cargo areas. Restrictions also apply to certain breeds. For instance, snub-nosed breeds of dogs and cats — like Pugs, Bulldogs, and Persian or Burmese cats — may be restricted from flying in cargo areas, depending on several factors, including the ambient temperature at that time of the year. Other airlines limit cabin travel for so-called “dangerous” breeds. As for fees, expect to pay between $100 and $200 to transport your pet one way, depending on his size. When booking your ticket, also consider leaving layover time for potty breaks if your pet is traveling with you in the cabin. Many airports offer dog relief areas so you can make a pit stop before boarding your next flight. Be prepared to go back through security if the rest areas aren’t adjacent to your concourse. Make Car Safety a Priority
It’s important to keep pets secured in the back-seat area to prevent them from distracting the driver. Also, the front seat is more dangerous for dogs and cats because the front airbags can seriously hurt or kill pets on impact. When looking at car restraints, it’s important to consider their two primary functions: keeping the animal contained and protecting him in the event of a crash.

For dog lovers, leaving their beloved dog for a period of time while on vacation is usually heart-wrenching. Bringing your pets on trips can be hassling at times, especially when the destinations you're bound to visit are not pet-friendly. But good news! There are actually a lot of dog-friendly places in the U.S. that you and your best pal can spend time in. Here are some of the best places you and your pup can go to for an unforgettable bonding time:
Austin, Texas. Austin is one of the best places to bond in for you and your furry pal. The place is teeming with lots of fun activities and entertainment, such as cheap festivals and concerts where dogs are allowed. According to Trips to Discover, Barton Creek Greenbelt and Zilker Metropolitan Park are also great places to play with your pet, and there's the Groovy Dog Bakery to buy your pet some treats. Carmel by the Sea, California. This seaside village is rated one of the best dog-friendly towns in the whole country, and it can't be doubted when the 25 hotels, inns, 44 restaurants, bars and coffee houses found in the village are all pooch-friendly. Tons of exclusive doggie services can be enjoyed here. Make sure to include a trip to Carmel Beach. According to Fodors, it's one of the state's few remaining off-leash beaches. Colorado Springs, Colorado. Embark on an adventure with your dog and take him/her with you on fun camping and hiking trails in Colorado Springs. Soak all the fresh mountain air and beautiful sceneries with your pup for a more intense bond. Some dog-friendly trails include the South Boulder Peak Trail, the Flatirons Vista Loop, and the Royal Arch Trail. Nashville, Tennessee. Nashville isn't just the music capital of the country, it may well be the friendliest city for pooches also. More than 50 hotels in the city welcome pooches in their midst, and there are other 75 dog-friendly establishments waiting for your pet. Let your dog meet new friends at the Centennial Dog Park, or experience the Trails at Fontanel.

Some of the guys who show up for happy hour at the Bark Bar don't bother with formalities when they spot a female. They get directly to enthusiastic sniffing. Of course, dogs can get away with the sort of behavior that would not end well if the mammal at the other end of the leash tried it. The humans do their share of scouting the opposite sex, but they trade puppy tales instead of sniffing each other. In an age of craft beer and effete cocktails, some pubs literally are deciding to go to the dogs. From Oregon to Florida, bar owners are finding that mixing drinking and dogs is good for business, especially in Denver, which surveys rank among the country's top dog-friendliest cities. And not just those little dogs that fit in purses, either. Service dogs have always been allowed in these establishments. But dog bars also welcome Great Pyrenees, Bernese Mountain Dogs, mutts, Tibetan Terriers and just about any other relatively obedient canine with a cold, inquisitive nose. Denver dogs and their owners can visit at least three local bars that offer a canine play area — the Bark Bar, the Watering Bowl and the Ugly Dog Sports Bar. Local 46currently allows dogs on-leash in its backyard beer garden, and the Tavern Uptownplans a remodel that will include a self-service bar and a dog patio. The Bark Bar and the Watering Bowl both offer fenced outdoor spaces that are the equivalent of small dog parks, with outdoor seating and tactfully placed plastic bags and scoops. ""A dog park is what inspired us — my husband and I were at the Berkeley dog park with our two dogs, and he wanted a coffee, and I wanted a craft beer,"" said owner Catherine Peters. ""I said, 'Wouldn't it be great if there was a dog park bar?' and he said, 'Sweetie, you should do that.' And we opened on Christmas Day last year. Best Christmas present ever!"" It's a concept whose time has come, says University of Denver adjunct professor Shadi Farhangrazi. ""Look at the demographic: In Colorado, we love our dogs, we love being outside, and we love fun, so this idea really is quite innovative. I'd compare it to other innovative trends, like having a Starbucks inside a Barnes & Noble so people buy coffee but maybe a book or magazine also, and having a cafe inside a supermarket like Whole Foods.""

They say that dogs are a man’s best friend, so why wouldn’t you want to spend as much time with your best friend as possible? While there are many cities out there that don’t have the time or the energy to deal with animals, you’ll be even happier to know that an even larger portion of cities are now become animal-friendly – especially when dogs are concerned. After all, who wouldn’t want to see pooches strolling along the streets or running through the park with their tails wagging? If you’re also the kind of person that loves dogs, then you should probably add these dog-friendly cities to your bucket list. Toronto should be on your bucket list anyway, but you should definitely bump it up to the top of your list because of how dog-friendly it is. This Canadian city is especially generous to their furry friends during the summer months, as they open up the whole city to these four-legged creatures. They are allowed to roam any of the 60 off-leash parks in Toronto, and they can even head to the beach without having to worry about causing a fuss. Although there are many stray dogs in Nepal, you’ll be happy to know that they are well looked after. Residents always make sure to leave out food for their pooches throughout the year, but things are turned up a notch during the festival of Diwali. During this festival, dogs are celebrated as though they are gods in themselves. They are adorned with flower wreaths and powder, and they are honored beyond measure. It’s an amazing spectacle to see. If you’ve ever been to Amsterdam, you’ll know that it’s the kind of city where anything goes. From the infamous Red Light District to the coffee shops, it seems as though all rules are out of the window here. This works in the favor of dog owners, as there are so many beloved pooches that get to experience a fun and exciting life. They are allowed on any form of public transport (although you will need to buy a ticket for them on the train), and they can even sit in your basket as you pedal along the beautiful canals. Tel Aviv, Israel
Tel Aviv is full of dogs, and this definitely sets our tails wagging. In fact, it’s been reported that there is one dog for every 17 people in this city – and that’s pretty impressive. Because there are just so many dog owners in Tel Aviv, the city has made it possible for these dog owners to spend as much time with their pooches as possible. There are so many parks and beaches that are open to paws of all shapes and sizes, and they even have an annual dog festival! Portland, Oregon, United States
Portland is known for being extremely liberal, and it seems as though they want to spend as much time with their pooches as possible. Because of this, the city has made it even easier for them to do this. There are now countless parks for them to enjoy off their leashes, and a huge number of the restaurants, bars, and cafes in the city are dog-friendly. As if that wasn’t cool enough, Portland is a pretty awesome destination in itself. Is it time to book your flights?

What’s better than traveling? Being able to travel with your pets! It’s a special treat to be able to create memories together while visiting scenic locations. I appreciate when someone helps to pave the way for dog friendly travel by hitting the trail and chronicling their adventures. As you know, sometimes places say they’re dog friendly online, only to be less than welcoming when a person arrives with their pup in tow. Our friends at GoPetFriendly help to demystify which locations are as dog friendly as they claim to be, while also sharing helpful tips, personal stories, and awesome photos. Last year, the GoPetFriendly crew went across the country on the “Ultimate Pet Friendly Road Trip.” This year, they published a book that fellow travelers can reference as they embark on their own pet friendly road trip!

While we currently reside in western Massachusetts, I’m originally from Southeastern Connecticut. Technically my hometown is Stonington, but it’s a short distance from historic Mystic. The town itself is incredibly dog friendly and it features a row of shops near a drawbridge that was first installed in 1835. At that time, Oxen were used to raise the bridge in order to allow tall ships to cross through and out towards the open water of the Long Island Sound. It still functions and opens about once an hour. Clearly, there have been updates so the use of Oxen is no longer needed. Many of the shops near the drawbridge are dog friendly, although guests should look for signage on store windows or inquire inside before bringing their four legged friend indoors. The town also has a dog friendly shopping area near the Mystic Aquarium (where I had my first summer job) which is called the Olde Mistic Village. Visitors can find Christmas decorations all year round in a Christmas themed shop, they can get old fashioned treats like kettle corn in the general store, and find dog themed gifts for themselves and the other dog lovers in their lives. Bean and Yoda mostly enjoy visiting so they can watch the ducks swim and quack near the center of the shopping area. They’re pretty immune to the yearning gaze of dogs, but I’m pretty sure Yoda would really like to give one a taste test if they got a little closer! A five minute drive from the Olde Mistic Village, and you’ll be near the main parking area for the Mystic Seaport. The Seaport is a sprawling property which includes a large number of buildings and ships for guests to explore. The grounds are dog friendly, allowing for your dog to enjoy learning about what it was like to work on a whaling ship back in the day. Well, I’m pretty sure your dog will not care one bit, but us humans can find the information about life on a whaling boat to be fascinating. Dogs aren’t allowed in all spaces, so it’s best if you can bring a few people with you so you can take turns with going into the exhibits while someone spends time with the four legged travel partner. There’s a lot of ground to cover when visiting the Mystic Seaport, so make sure you are wearing comfy shoes and have drinking water for your dog. There are water bowls spread throughout the property, but we brought a collapsible bowl so we could give the dogs water whenever they seemed thirsty instead of having to search for one. One of Yoda’s favorite parts of his visit was watching men dressed in historically appropriate clothing singing old whaling songs on the town green. Yoda really wanted to join in on the singing, and he contributed with his signature snorts and grumbles.","[{'passage': 'This is Spilling the Beans, where plugged-in baristas give us the lowdown on where to go, what to do, and what to eat (and drink) in their hometown. ""People ask me why I left Portland, and I tell them that Cleveland now is very similar to what Portland was 15 years ago,"" said Robert Stockham, general manager at the city\'s premiere coffee roaster, Rising Star. Except Cleveland is a city with its own swagger, and a cost of living so low that Stockham said, ""You can buy a house for less than a car, and you should never pay full retail price for anything here."" Also: Cleveland is the place for a hipster hotdog hangout that puts Froot Loops on its dogs, a brewery that has residents lining up for Christmas-spiced beer, and one of the world\'s best symphony orchestras. Come hungry, and let Stockham be your guide. Where should we stay? If you stay downtown, you can\'t go wrong. My favorite is Wallace Manor Bed and Breakfast in Ohio City; it’s a beautiful old, Victorian-era building that was recently renovated. The owners are super friendly and take care of people really well. We also have a Westin downtown that’s attached to Urban Farmer, a steakhouse that sources what it can locally. Other hotels to consider: the Metropolitan at the Nine, a luxury hotel-condo-restaurant complex, which is new, and a big deal for Cleveland; the new Hilton; and the Drury Hotel, because it’s in a converted school district administration building and is all marble. Where should we grab breakfast? Urban Farmer has a great brunch. But the real place to go is Jack Flaps. Their pancakes are freaking amazing. Everyone raves about a short stack of the lemon curd pancakes, but I love the Benedicto Mexicano, which has cornbread, chorizo, gravy, crema, and sunny side up eggs. Best cup of coffee? Rising Star, of course. Then Six Shooter Coffee, a local roaster, is in the Waterloo neighborhood nearest the best wood-fired pizza in town, Citizen Pie. Pour Cleveland is a multi-roaster. Vintage Tea and Coffee is also good. Best place to see great art? The Cleveland Museum of Art is nothing short of amazing. Not only is it one of the few free museums remaining in the country, but it has Rodin’s Thinker and one of Monet’s water lilies. Nobody talks about how unbelievable it is. Also, the covered atrium there is one of the most beautiful places in town. Best market to eat your way around? West Side Market. It celebrated its 100 year anniversary a few years ago. There are fish, meat, spice, and produce vendors. If you want spices, try Urban Herbs. Then try Rooted in Cleveland for local produce and pour-over coffee. The other two I love are the crepe stand and also a fishmonger called Kate’s Fish, which is notable because we\'re not near water and the fish they sell is excellent. Best old-school Cleveland restaurant institution? Pier W is the old standby with the best seafood in all of Northeast Ohio; it overlooks the lake. The other one would be Johnny’s, a downtown fancy steakhouse restaurant that’s been there for several decades. But the Cleveland institution everyone raves about is Sokolowski’s. We have a large Eastern European population here, and this is THE place to get pierogies, cabbage, and the like. Hottest new restaurant in town? First, Mabel’s BBQ. It’s a Michael Symon project that’s reimagining Cleveland-style barbecue. Then there’s The Proper Pig. The Southern Café serves awesome Southern food. Also, I’m most excited about The Arcadian, which is trying to get as close to farm to table as it possibly can. On the more upscale end, there’s a French restaurant called L’Albatros that is absolutely to die for. I also should mention Happy Dog in Gordon Square. It’s a hipster hot dog hangout that serves great beer and a hot dog menu with wacky toppings like Sriracha, Froot Loops, and peanut butter. Which restaurants do you frequent? Superior Pho for one serves hands down the best pho in town. Then Caribe Bake Shop, which is a Latin American food restaurant that isn’t exactly a bakery the way its name says.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:eb36cdec-a1a2-4939-94f5-6519a6415da1>']}, {'passage': ""Travel Update: COVID safety precautions are now at the discretion of individual business owners.

In fact, it was unabashed dog lover King Frederick of Prussia that first coined the phrase “man’s best friend” back in 1789. These three small words have since described a millenia-long bond between man and dog; a bond that has become increasingly strong with the passing of time. For modern-day dog owners, “man’s best friend” is a comrade to be included in every aspect of life. We buy fashionable outfits for our pups. We create social media accounts for our furry friends, proudly sharing images of our pets just as first-time parents would. And now, dog lovers can rejoice over the emergence of drinking establishments that are not only dog-friendly, but dog-centric. In this pup-friendly bar trend Neptune Beach’s own BrewHound Dog Park + Bar and Riverside’s Kanine Social are leading the pack. Just weeks ago, Lauren Wyckoff and Jason Underwood opened the doors (gates?) of BrewHound Dog Park + Bar. “We were visiting Orlando and got to thinking, if you can bring your kid to a waterpark and have a drink, why can’t you go somewhere to have a beer with your dog?” reasons Wyckoff. “At the time, we hadn’t heard of anywhere where you could do that.”\nThe duo then set out to create a community-driven space filled with pups and local libations. “Our main goal was to get people together enjoying something outdoors so that they can have a greater appreciation of the environment,” says Wyckoff, who, along with Underwood is a self-proclaimed outdoor enthusiast. “When people visit the park, they’re engaging and meeting with people, which is what it’s all about.”\nFeaturing lots of rustic decor, BrewHound offers its two-legged customers a rotating variety of local craft beers, wine on tap, and Bold Bean specialty coffee. Owners can sip and stroll with their furry friends in “The Yard,” BrewHound’s off-leash dog park with daily, monthly, and annual memberships available. If you’re a dog-lover in search of a brew closer to downtown, College Street’s Kanine Social welcomes pups and owners alike to sit and stay for a cool beverage. Owners Daniel Moffatt and Dustin Fries opened Kanine in 2017, becoming Jax’s first boutique doggie daycare and private dog park to pair with a craft beer and coffee bar. “We first talked about the idea of opening a dog park and bar four or five years ago,” Moffatt explains. “We were always looking for a place where we could bring our dogs, enjoy a beer and watch a football game.”\nKanine’s taproom is open to the public, serving up beer on tap, wine, and ciders, while patron’s pups can avail themselves of some off-leash exercise. These amenities are paired with Kanine Social’s dog daycare. “Our concept allows them [patrons] the freedom to let their dogs run and play,” says Moffatt. “While enjoying a beer and having time to meet up with old friends or make new friends.”\nThough Kanine Social hasn’t been open to the public for quite a year yet, Moffatt and Fries have their eyes set toward opening a second location in the next 18-24 months.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:80965d7e-3492-4c8e-8ef7-ba5d0304e7e0>']}, {'passage': 'Dogs are welcome, at least under certain circumstances, in more places with each passing year. A number of parks, schools, hotels and hospitals now allow dogs, and a wide variety of businesses let both employees and customers bring their dogs with them. There are still a lot of places that are off limits to our four-legged family members, and this continues to affect most people with dogs. I was recently at a local bookstore that allows dogs, but the café inside the store is for people only. There is a very nice sign saying that health codes prohibit them from welcoming dogs to the café, though they are welcome in the rest of the store. The staff works very hard to accommodate people who have brought their dog to the bookstore and would like a cup of coffee by bringing their orders out of the café and into the main part of the bookstore. I’m sure many dog guardians skip the café because they can’t sit down and enjoy a drink if accompanied by a dog. However, many people do request “delivery” to the main part of the store, and seem appreciative of the option. Years ago I worked with a woman who would hardly go anywhere without her dog. She brought him to work, which was allowed as we worked at a facility that provided dog training, dog grooming and dog day care. This woman never went to the movies because her dog was not allowed to go with her, and never ate in restaurants for the same reason. She made some concessions to practicality such as going to the grocery store or on other errands alone, but she generally only went where her dog was allowed to come, too. She made decisions that many could consider extreme, but they certainly worked for her and for her dog. Her social life was affected by her unwillingness to go places without her dog, but she has always been very happy with her choices and has a good life. Are there any places you don’t go because of restrictions that prevent your dog from coming, too?', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:2074f70e-250b-4d43-8c63-77d4f989422f>']}, {'passage': 'It’s the end of the summer and you want to get away. However, you don’t want to leave your furry friend at home. So, where are the best places to go with your pooch in the US? Reviews.com reached out to Nature Reflections in response to our blog post Have Car, Have Dog, Let’s Have an Adventure with a great article on places to travel with your dog. Not only does their article explore the top 10 places but they do a deep dive of the most dog friendly towns throughout the US. It is a must read for any dog lover that likes to travel with their companion. By Jackie Nelson- Feature Writer\nThe U.S. is full of incredible places to visit, but if you’re planning to take along your furry family member, there are some important things to consider. Outdoor recreation, lodging, and even dining take on added importance when planning a trip with your dog. It’s also safe to say a dog-friendly destination would have some type of doggie daycare and good access to veterinary care in case of emergency. Overall, having good amenities for your pup can make or break your entire experience. We spent over 150 hours researching what makes the best vacation spot and came up with 100 top locations out of 567 possible destinations to visit with your dog. And why did we do all this? Because we want to help people research and find the best places to visit that don’t require leaving Fido behind. We determined the top cities to visit with your dog by scrutinizing and cutting from a total of 1,000 of the biggest tourist destinations across the country according to TripAdvisor and Touropia. Using population density, we were able to filter out highly populated metropolitan areas full of traffic, concrete, and crowds – definitely not conducive to a doggone good time. Next, we graded the frontrunners against seven crucial criteria that would helped a city rank higher on our list. These factors included: number of dog parks, availability of dog trails, amount of dog-friendly restaurants, options for dog-friendly lodging, nearby dog-friendly beaches, availability of dog daycares, and nearby veterinarians or emergency clinics. Based on this research, we grouped those factors into two different city scores: amenities and outdoor activities. We also talked to three experts who provided additional information about traveling with your dog:\n- Erin Ballinger, the destinations editor at BringFido, offered essential tips for exploring the world with a pup. - Suzanne Bryner of Lucky Fido Dog Training recommended training techniquesto turn your dog into a great travel companion. - And Kathleen Darling, the Infection Prevention Coordinator at Texas A&M University Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, explained how to make traveling a safe and healthy adventure for your pup. What We Learned\nIn our research, we discovered a majority of our most dog-friendly destinations are in the southeast United States. If you’re traveling in the summer months, Darling recommends limiting time outside and making sure your pup has plenty of water. We awarded honorable mentions for the most dog trails, most dog parks, the most dog-friendly beaches, the most dog daycares, and the most dog-friendly restaurants. We also had to figure out just the right approach to weighing certain aspects of a destination against another. For example, we determined outdoor activities to be a significant factor for those considering where to visit with their dog. This resulted in a place like Nantucket, Massachusetts, earning an overall high score (and making the top 10) despite having relatively few pet-friendly amenities, since it does have such great outdoor activities.

If few options exist, create a backup plan: Will the hotel allow you to leave your pet crated in the hotel room? Or can you order in food or even prepare your own meals in your room? Regardless of where you’re traveling, be sure to comply with local leash laws and always clean up after your pet as a courtesy to others who are sharing the public or private space. Prep Your Hosts\nIf you’re planning to stay with a family or friend along the way, be upfront about your pet’s needs so there are no surprises. You’ll also need to ask about the house rules:\n- Are pets allowed on the furniture? - Can dogs do their business in the yard, or would your hosts prefer that you go for a morning and evening walk? - Is the yard fenced? - Do your friends have other animals in the home? Do they have kids? - Is there a safe room for your pet to stay if you leave the house, or will you need to bring along a crate? - All of these questions will help make your stay more peaceful and comfortable for everyone. Choose Your Mode of Transportation\nMany traditional travel options are off limits to pets. Here are some considerations when planning your trip:\nRental cars: The majority of rental car agencies have pet-friendly policies and allow dogs and cats in the car. Some may require your pet to be crated during travel, and agencies may apply extra fees for any damage or necessary cleaning. Buses: Certain cities like Seattle have pet-friendly policies that allow leashed dogs on public transportation. But most national bus chains don’t allow animals. Subways: Check your local destinations for their pet policies. Some subways allow leashed or contained animals to ride when accompanied by their owner. Ferry lines: Most ferry lines allow pets on board if they remain with their humans in the car, and some have adopted policies that allow animals in specific areas of the vessel. Trains: Most trains will not allow pets on board or in cargo areas. However, there are always exceptions. Certain European countries have more open travel options for pets. Cruises: While many small carriers offer one- to three-hour “sightseeing” cruises for people and their pets, animals aren’t traditionally welcome on ocean liners. One exception is Cunard’s Queen Mary 2, which offers a transatlantic voyage starting or ending in New York, as well as European voyages. The ship boasts an onboard kennel area for housing dogs and cats, space for walking dogs, and designated areas for guests to spend time with their pets. Airlines: Each airline has its own restrictions and fees when it comes to transporting pets, and the size of your pet is a big consideration. Small pets traveling in the cabin will need to fit within the seat space. If your pet is too big to fit under the seat, you’ll need an airline-approved crate with proper ventilation for transporting your pal in one of the plane’s climate-controlled cargo areas. Restrictions also apply to certain breeds. For instance, snub-nosed breeds of dogs and cats — like Pugs, Bulldogs, and Persian or Burmese cats — may be restricted from flying in cargo areas, depending on several factors, including the ambient temperature at that time of the year. Other airlines limit cabin travel for so-called “dangerous” breeds. As for fees, expect to pay between $100 and $200 to transport your pet one way, depending on his size. When booking your ticket, also consider leaving layover time for potty breaks if your pet is traveling with you in the cabin. Many airports offer dog relief areas so you can make a pit stop before boarding your next flight. Be prepared to go back through security if the rest areas aren’t adjacent to your concourse. Make Car Safety a Priority\nIt’s important to keep pets secured in the back-seat area to prevent them from distracting the driver. Also, the front seat is more dangerous for dogs and cats because the front airbags can seriously hurt or kill pets on impact. When looking at car restraints, it’s important to consider their two primary functions: keeping the animal contained and protecting him in the event of a crash.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:36fd1ea3-cec8-436e-a8a1-e8b4a1bd252b>']}, {'passage': ""For dog lovers, leaving their beloved dog for a period of time while on vacation is usually heart-wrenching. Bringing your pets on trips can be hassling at times, especially when the destinations you're bound to visit are not pet-friendly. But good news! There are actually a lot of dog-friendly places in the U.S. that you and your best pal can spend time in. Here are some of the best places you and your pup can go to for an unforgettable bonding time:\nAustin, Texas. Austin is one of the best places to bond in for you and your furry pal. The place is teeming with lots of fun activities and entertainment, such as cheap festivals and concerts where dogs are allowed. According to Trips to Discover, Barton Creek Greenbelt and Zilker Metropolitan Park are also great places to play with your pet, and there's the Groovy Dog Bakery to buy your pet some treats. Carmel by the Sea, California. This seaside village is rated one of the best dog-friendly towns in the whole country, and it can't be doubted when the 25 hotels, inns, 44 restaurants, bars and coffee houses found in the village are all pooch-friendly. Tons of exclusive doggie services can be enjoyed here. Make sure to include a trip to Carmel Beach. According to Fodors, it's one of the state's few remaining off-leash beaches. Colorado Springs, Colorado. Embark on an adventure with your dog and take him/her with you on fun camping and hiking trails in Colorado Springs. Soak all the fresh mountain air and beautiful sceneries with your pup for a more intense bond. Some dog-friendly trails include the South Boulder Peak Trail, the Flatirons Vista Loop, and the Royal Arch Trail. Nashville, Tennessee. Nashville isn't just the music capital of the country, it may well be the friendliest city for pooches also. More than 50 hotels in the city welcome pooches in their midst, and there are other 75 dog-friendly establishments waiting for your pet.

They get directly to enthusiastic sniffing. Of course, dogs can get away with the sort of behavior that would not end well if the mammal at the other end of the leash tried it. The humans do their share of scouting the opposite sex, but they trade puppy tales instead of sniffing each other. In an age of craft beer and effete cocktails, some pubs literally are deciding to go to the dogs. From Oregon to Florida, bar owners are finding that mixing drinking and dogs is good for business, especially in Denver, which surveys rank among the country\'s top dog-friendliest cities. And not just those little dogs that fit in purses, either. Service dogs have always been allowed in these establishments. But dog bars also welcome Great Pyrenees, Bernese Mountain Dogs, mutts, Tibetan Terriers and just about any other relatively obedient canine with a cold, inquisitive nose. Denver dogs and their owners can visit at least three local bars that offer a canine play area — the Bark Bar, the Watering Bowl and the Ugly Dog Sports Bar. Local 46currently allows dogs on-leash in its backyard beer garden, and the Tavern Uptownplans a remodel that will include a self-service bar and a dog patio. The Bark Bar and the Watering Bowl both offer fenced outdoor spaces that are the equivalent of small dog parks, with outdoor seating and tactfully placed plastic bags and scoops. ""A dog park is what inspired us — my husband and I were at the Berkeley dog park with our two dogs, and he wanted a coffee, and I wanted a craft beer,"" said owner Catherine Peters.

It\'s a concept whose time has come, says University of Denver adjunct professor Shadi Farhangrazi. ""Look at the demographic: In Colorado, we love our dogs, we love being outside, and we love fun, so this idea really is quite innovative. I\'d compare it to other innovative trends, like having a Starbucks inside a Barnes & Noble so people buy coffee but maybe a book or magazine also, and having a cafe inside a supermarket like Whole Foods.""', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:e1efcf1c-ec5b-4fa3-b793-dbf8f9edc491>']}, {'passage': 'They say that dogs are a man’s best friend, so why wouldn’t you want to spend as much time with your best friend as possible? While there are many cities out there that don’t have the time or the energy to deal with animals, you’ll be even happier to know that an even larger portion of cities are now become animal-friendly – especially when dogs are concerned. After all, who wouldn’t want to see pooches strolling along the streets or running through the park with their tails wagging? If you’re also the kind of person that loves dogs, then you should probably add these dog-friendly cities to your bucket list. Toronto should be on your bucket list anyway, but you should definitely bump it up to the top of your list because of how dog-friendly it is. This Canadian city is especially generous to their furry friends during the summer months, as they open up the whole city to these four-legged creatures. They are allowed to roam any of the 60 off-leash parks in Toronto, and they can even head to the beach without having to worry about causing a fuss. Although there are many stray dogs in Nepal, you’ll be happy to know that they are well looked after. Residents always make sure to leave out food for their pooches throughout the year, but things are turned up a notch during the festival of Diwali. During this festival, dogs are celebrated as though they are gods in themselves. They are adorned with flower wreaths and powder, and they are honored beyond measure. It’s an amazing spectacle to see. If you’ve ever been to Amsterdam, you’ll know that it’s the kind of city where anything goes. From the infamous Red Light District to the coffee shops, it seems as though all rules are out of the window here. This works in the favor of dog owners, as there are so many beloved pooches that get to experience a fun and exciting life. They are allowed on any form of public transport (although you will need to buy a ticket for them on the train), and they can even sit in your basket as you pedal along the beautiful canals. Tel Aviv, Israel\nTel Aviv is full of dogs, and this definitely sets our tails wagging. In fact, it’s been reported that there is one dog for every 17 people in this city – and that’s pretty impressive. Because there are just so many dog owners in Tel Aviv, the city has made it possible for these dog owners to spend as much time with their pooches as possible. There are so many parks and beaches that are open to paws of all shapes and sizes, and they even have an annual dog festival! Portland, Oregon, United States\nPortland is known for being extremely liberal, and it seems as though they want to spend as much time with their pooches as possible. Because of this, the city has made it even easier for them to do this. There are now countless parks for them to enjoy off their leashes, and a huge number of the restaurants, bars, and cafes in the city are dog-friendly.

MYSTIC SEAPORT & OTHER DOG FRIENDLY SPOTS NEARBY\nWhile we currently reside in western Massachusetts, I’m originally from Southeastern Connecticut. Technically my hometown is Stonington, but it’s a short distance from historic Mystic. The town itself is incredibly dog friendly and it features a row of shops near a drawbridge that was first installed in 1835. At that time, Oxen were used to raise the bridge in order to allow tall ships to cross through and out towards the open water of the Long Island Sound. It still functions and opens about once an hour. Clearly, there have been updates so the use of Oxen is no longer needed. Many of the shops near the drawbridge are dog friendly, although guests should look for signage on store windows or inquire inside before bringing their four legged friend indoors. The town also has a dog friendly shopping area near the Mystic Aquarium (where I had my first summer job) which is called the Olde Mistic Village. Visitors can find Christmas decorations all year round in a Christmas themed shop, they can get old fashioned treats like kettle corn in the general store, and find dog themed gifts for themselves and the other dog lovers in their lives. Bean and Yoda mostly enjoy visiting so they can watch the ducks swim and quack near the center of the shopping area. They’re pretty immune to the yearning gaze of dogs, but I’m pretty sure Yoda would really like to give one a taste test if they got a little closer! A five minute drive from the Olde Mistic Village, and you’ll be near the main parking area for the Mystic Seaport. The Seaport is a sprawling property which includes a large number of buildings and ships for guests to explore. The grounds are dog friendly, allowing for your dog to enjoy learning about what it was like to work on a whaling ship back in the day. Well, I’m pretty sure your dog will not care one bit, but us humans can find the information about life on a whaling boat to be fascinating. Dogs aren’t allowed in all spaces, so it’s best if you can bring a few people with you so you can take turns with going into the exhibits while someone spends time with the four legged travel partner. There’s a lot of ground to cover when visiting the Mystic Seaport, so make sure you are wearing comfy shoes and have drinking water for your dog. There are water bowls spread throughout the property, but we brought a collapsible bowl so we could give the dogs water whenever they seemed thirsty instead of having to search for one. One of Yoda’s favorite parts of his visit was watching men dressed in historically appropriate clothing singing old whaling songs on the town green. Yoda really wanted to join in on the singing, and he contributed with his signature snorts and grumbles.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:fd14f502-6953-40b1-bd97-1ce20257e666>']}]","{

6,<urn:uuid:913e2a78-02f9-480b-9b9f-384f96743e60>,"One of my favorite things about spring is the re-emergence of camping weather! Camping is one of my absolute favorite ways to spend a long weekend, but I know that for a lot of people, just the idea of spending a night or two outdoors sounds nothing short of horrendous – and, yes, without the proper precautions, it can be!
But the more you camp, the more you learn, and I thought it would be fun to share some of the tips and tricks I’ve learned (usually the hard way) to make your next camping trip the best one yet.
And if something still goes wrong? Trust me when I say that some of my favorite camping memories are the ones where everything went to shit (like that time we ended up eating eggs at a Denny’s at midnight amid a torrential downpour that flooded the campground’s latrines…it’s funny now, though!).
So, without further ado, here are my camping essentials!
1. Pack LAYERS.
There is nothing worse than being cold (and I lived in freakin’ Sweden for nearly ten years, so I know). Even if you think bringing that extra sweater or pair of leggings seems ridiculous, just do it. You’ll be so grateful later. I always do like my dear Mama, and wear a pair of long underwear when camping, as it is much easier to remove layers if you’re too hot. Also, sleeping bags may keep your body warm, but I always bring an extra pair of socks, gloves, and a hat to keep my extremities warm and toasty all night long. As we say in Sweden, there’s no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothes!
2. Anticipate darkness.
This may sound totally obvious, but, out in nature, there is this concept of night, and, away from the modern luxury of electricity, night time is usually quite DARK. While this means you’ll get to see some incredible stars, I always, always, always seem to forget how hard it is to manage in pitch black darkness. Plan ahead and bring as many flashlights, torches, headlamps (the best), as you can because you will need them. One of my favorite camping hacks? Strap a headlamp onto a gallon jug of water or milk for an instant portable lamp.
3. Pack sustainable food.
When I say ‘sustainable’, I’m referring to food that will a) survive no or little refrigeration, b) be able to handle lots of movement, and c) still be appealing three days later. I always take a cooler when I camp, but, depending on the length of your trip, that may or may not ensure that all your food stays fresh the whole time. My favorite thing to do is to plan all of the meals ahead of time, and shop accordingly. Also, make sure to prep your food for easy cleanup/cooking time. If you want eggs for breakfast, crack them into a ziplock bag for easy transportation along with any cheese, salt/pepper/veggies, etc., that you want to add. If you want to grill hamburgers for dinner, wash, chop, and separate all your ingredients ahead of time to avoid doing so at the campsite. My favorite foods to bring on a camping trip are make-ahead breakfast burritos, kettle corn, foil-wrapped dinners, hot dogs/bratwursts, sandwich supplies (pb&j, ham and cheese, turkey, sprouts, mustard, etc.), and, of course, s’mores!
4. Embrace the gross
Depending on your level of comfort when it comes to roughing-it, camping usually means that you’ll be shower-less for the next few days. Instead of focusing on how gross that might be, just embrace it! It’s not like you have a job interview later that day or something (and if you do, reschedule immediately). Instead, focus on little ways to feel fresh sans shower, like brushing your teeth (totally doable with a bottle of water), changing your underwear daily (seriously, this makes a HUGE difference), and, if you have long hair, putting it up into an up-do of some kind (I usually go for french braids) to keep it off your face. In a few days’ time, you’ll be back in your lovely, warm shower, promise!
5. Anticipate problems
Knock on wood, you won’t need to break out your first-aid-kit or car jack, but I’m a firm believer in the idea that being unprepared is just asking for trouble. Always let someone know where you’re going (especially if going alone, which I do not recommend unless you’re a seasoned outdoors-person, and even then, remember this???). Make sure you always have:
- Lots of water
- Toilet paper
- A good knife
- A lighter or box of matches
- First aid kit
- A map and compass
- Storm-proof outdoor gear
- A way of contacting someone in case of emergency (phone, walkie-talkie, etc.)
6. Bring some of the good stuff
Camping is a bit of work, but that doesn’t mean that it shouldn’t be enjoyable! I always make sure to bring a good bottle of wine or flask of whiskey, a pack of playing cards, a frisbee or soccer ball, some comfortable lawn chairs, a hammock, a good book, and a portable radio for some of the quieter moments.
Always make sure to research where you’re going and what there is nearby before leaving for your trip. Your phone will most likely not work once there, so having some print outs of fun activities in the area can be great when you want to explore your surroundings. It’s also a good idea to know where the nearest store or town is in case of emergency (like running out of toilet paper!) or if you just absolutely need a ‘real’ cup of coffee in the morning.

### Context: Should I Wash My Underwear While Traveling? Answer: No! Let’s face it, we travelers put up with a lot of aggravation on the road: lost baggage, missing passports, loud hostels, etc. . . . And we see a lot of things that bother us around the world: obnoxious tourists, environmental degradation, the plight of the world’s poor. But there’s one thing that annoys us the most, and which is constantly on our minds. Yes, I’m talking about your underwear. How many times have you, midway through your trip, with nary a laundry machine to be had, thought to yourself, “I wish I didn’t have to change my underwear so darn often!”
Well, you are in luck, for our nation’s best and brightest scientists, chemical engineers, microbiologists, and PHD-toting eggheads have put aside some time (finally!) from their — let’s face it, kind of fruitless — endeavors such as finding a cure for HIV/AIDS, solving economic disparity, and addressing climate change, and finally tackled that age-old world issue: the irritation of changing your underwear. I introduce to you the Give-N-Go underwear from ExOficio: the world’s first underwear that does not need to be washed (very often). To you, the intrepid traveler, who asks, “Why do I need to change my underwear so often?”, ExOficio says, “Don’t!”
These space-age undies’ tag line, in Draper-esque fashion are: “17 countries. 6 Weeks. One pair of underwear. Okay, maybe two.” But we know they really mean one, right? A look at their package reveals what exactly these bad boys do: “[Give-N-Go’s are] high performance and low maintenance. Treated with Aegis Microbe Shield they’re odor resistant and perfect for tricky climates and active adventures.” Please, no more selling is necessary. You had me at the words “Microbe Shield.”
And forget the Parisian runways, this line of underwear (and I’m not making this up) is advertised as being both “field tested and approved” by the African Wildlife Foundation, an organization you may not have realized was so intimately involved in the world of haute coutre. But let’s not take their word for it, let’s take a look at some of the (incredibly) non-anonymous customer reviews left on the underwear’s Amazon page (And for those keeping score, there were 28 five-star, one four-star, and only one one-star reviews). One very proud owner remarked, “You can live on two pairs of these — wash one at night, wear the other. Wrap it in a towel, stomp dry — should be ready in a few hours.” And here you’ve just been using your towel for your body all this time. And how about this astonished user: “Care for this item is almost too simple. I wash mine in the bathroom sink with a very small amount of detergent and hang dry for a few hours and they are ready to go again.” Oh to be that bathroom-goer lucky enough to get to use that sink right after him. (Well, at least he said he uses detergent.) And finally, where there’s a happy underwear wearer, there’s a happy mom. This from a proud mother who got her entire family in on the act: “This item was purchased for my son who was traveling to another country. He thanked me so much upon his return. He was with a group that was camping for several weeks and said this boxer brief was the most comfortable to wear, the most convenient to launder and quickest to dry. I then purchased one for another son who travels; he agrees.” It’s stories like these that get recounted during funeral eulogies and around the buffet table at wakes by bereaved children; this mother has certainly fulfilled her parental duties.

How to maintain personal hygiene on a trek! Vanity goes out of the window when you are in the wilderness. One is in the mountains to survive in the simplest forms like the mountain men. Because that’s how Yeti is supposed to be. But that doesn’t mean you should ignore your personal hygiene too. Spending days in the wilderness on long treks like Roopkund Trek, Pin Parvati Pass with no bath can make you stink like a raccoon and make you feel all icky and lousy. Maintaining personal hygiene on the trek is as important as keeping yourself hydrated on the trek. Not only it keeps the diseases at bay but also helps you feel fresh and vigorous for a longer time. These things can feel a bit of a struggle with no proper sanitation facilities available on the trek as we are used to back in the comfort of our homes. Here is how you can carry out your personal hygiene manners on the trek without any fuss:
1. Making your business
Do not defecate where you eat. Even the dogs follow this simple rule. Then why not we humans. Keep these things in mind next to you attend nature's call in the woods. - Do not make a toilet tent or dig a hole near your camp. The defecation area should be at least 50 meters away from your tent and the water source. - Dig a 6-inch deep hole for your business. A hole deeper than this will slow down the decomposition process since the decomposing bacteria are present in the upper layer of soils. - Do not use wet wipes. They are non-biodegradable. If you have to use anything, use toilet paper. Make sure you dump the toilet paper along with your feces. Cover your dump with dry leaves and soil after making your business. Use of water though is best. - When Aunt Flow arrives on the trek, disposing off tampons is a common concern for women but that doesn’t mean there is no solution. Make sure you dispose off your used pads and tampons in a ziplock bag which you discard off once back from the trek. - Always remember to clean your hand with hand sanitizer after doing your business lest you should get hand to mouth infection. 2. Changing clothes on the trek
How often should you change clothes on trek? If it is a long trek, it is wise option to rotate your clothes. Segregate your hiking clothes and camping clothes. After you reach the camping site, change into clean and dry clothing. Your sweaty clothes from hiking can end up giving you body rashes and bad odor. Sleeping with soiled clothes on in your sleeping bag can really make you uncomfortable. Plus, your sleeping will bag will start to stink too. Next day, when you resume trekking, you can change back into your trekking clothes. Avoid changing into a different pair of clothes in sub-zero temperatures on the treks like Bali Pass and Goecha La unless absolutely necessary. 3. How to take a dry bath
“Bathe twice a day to be really clean, once a day to be passably clean, once a week to avoid being a public menace.” ~Anthony Burgess
You are lucky if you stumble upon a lake or pond on the trek and the weather is just right to take a quick dip in the water. If not, you can always take a dry bath. All you need to do is wipe yourself thoroughly before you change into a new set of clothes. To give yourself a quick dry bath:
- Use a damp towel and give yourself a sponge bath. You can also use wet wipes to wipe yourself clean. But make sure you collect them in your trash bag instead of throwing it off in the mountains. - Clean the troubling areas like groin, armpits, spaces between toes, and inner thighs with alcohol-based hand sanitizer. - Do not use a deodorant to hide your body odor. Its sweet smell attracts wildlife. Also, the aerosols in your deodorant pollute the air. It’s better you leave it at home. - Change your clothes in the daytime when the temperature is comparatively warm. Working up a sweat on the trek is always wow. But it will just be a matter of few days when the flies start meandering around you if ignore your personal hygiene. Not a pretty picture, right? Following these hygiene tips can save you from the humiliation.

Good personal hygiene is one of the best ways to protect yourself from getting illnesses such as gastroenteritis and the common cold. Washing your hands with soap removes germs that can make you ill. Maintaining good personal hygiene will also help prevent you from spreading diseases to other people. What is personal hygiene? Personal hygiene includes:
- cleaning your body every day
- washing your hands with soap after going to the toilet
- brushing your teeth twice a day
- covering your mouth and nose with a tissue (or your sleeve) when sneezing or coughing
- washing your hands after handling pets and other animals
Why is personal hygiene important? Good hygiene is vital because it helps prevent you and your children from getting or spreading germs and infectious diseases. The germs that cause many diseases can be passed on through touching other people, getting faeces (poo) on your hands, handling contaminated food and coming into contact with dirty surfaces or objects. Conditions that you can develop if you have poor personal hygiene include:
Washing your body
Try to bath or shower each day. Wash well, especially under your armpits and around your genitals and anus. Keeping clean will prevent skin irritations and remove bacteria that cause body odour. Wash yourself with soap, shower gel or a hypoallergenic body wash. Soap removes more germs, but you may need to wash sensitive body parts with plain water or salt water. If there is no tap water or it is scarce, clean yourself with a clean wet cloth or sponge. Washing your hands
To avoid getting sick, wash your hands properly. - Wet your hands, then wash with soap or with an alcohol-based hand sanitiser for at least 20 seconds. Lather between the fingers and the back of your hands. - Clean grubby nails with a scrubbing brush, if one is available. - Rinse both sides of your hands, preferably under clean running water. - Dry off your hands with a clean towel or let them dry in the air. When to wash your hands
It is especially important to wash your hands after going to the toilet because faeces, which you might come into contact with, contains billions of germs. Also, wash your hands:
- before and after eating or preparing food
- after changing babies’ nappies
- before and after touching a sick person or cleaning up vomit or body fluids
- after blowing your nose
- before and after treating cuts or wounds
- after touching rubbish, dirty surfaces or objects
- after handling pets or farm animals
Find out more here about hand washing. Washing your genitals
Men who are uncircumcised can clean their penis by gently pulling back the foreskin and washing underneath it with warm water or soap. See more here about penis care. Women can gently wash the delicate skin around the vulva with a soap-free wash, salt water or plain water. Avoid perfumed soap and bath products since these may irritate the sensitive skin of the vulva. Do not douche, because it upsets the healthy good bacteria in your vagina. During menstruation (your periods), wash your vulva as usual. Tampons can be changed every 3 to 4 hours. To avoid toxic shock syndrome, do not leave a tampon in for more than 8 hours. Change sanitary pads several times a day. Wash your hands before and after changing tampons or pads. Preventing body odour

Why Feminine Hygiene Is So Important And What To Do About It
Last updated on : August 13 2020
Sometimes We Are Too Busy For Personal Hygiene
Women have a lot of responsibilities in the household. Traditionally we are the primary caregivers in our families. We prepare food, care for the kids, and ensure the house is clean. In some cases, we are the breadwinner of the family too, having to handle our family responsibilities while working a job or two. Under these circumstances, we might not be able to pay full attention to our hygiene in a bid to keep up with our busy lifestyles. However, Our Cleanliness Is Vital To Our Health
It's unforgivable that we brush aside something as crucial as our feminine hygiene for these reasons. We are all aware of the importance of keeping ourselves, all parts of our bodies, particularly our intimate areas clean. Our cleanliness is vital because of the various cycles we go through, including menstruation. Irregular cleaning and poor hygiene during periods can lead to the growth and spread of bacteria in our genitals, with unfortunate repercussions. In this article, we focus on why personal hygiene in women is paramount and ways to attain it. Watch The Video

Personal hygiene means staying healthy and preventing diseases through practices of cleanliness. It involves grooming yourself and making hygienic decisions daily. The best way to keep excellent personal hygiene is to have a daily routine that you strictly maintain. Here are some excellent examples to adapt, and an explanation of why they are essential:
Wash Your Hands Regularly
Washing hands is a fundamental but essential aspect of hygiene because you regularly use your hands throughout the day. Your hands are one part of your body that easily comes into contact with germs and microorganisms. Colds, flu, coughing, and Hepatitis A are just some of the many diseases you can contract and even spread by having poor hand hygiene. Keep Your Hair Clean
Hair washing is not only necessary for hygienic purposes, but it could be a defining factor in your overall beauty as a woman. Bad hair hygiene can easily cause lice infestation, which is very unpleasant. To avoid this, condition and shampoo your hair at least 2-3 times a week. Don't compromise on this rule. Body odor is not attractive in any way, and not bathing will cause body odor. Also, there are so many harmful microorganisms that you kill by taking a bath, so why avoid one? And there are therapeutic benefits too. Studies show that the body releases serotonin, a hormone that gives a feeling of euphoria, after cold showers. Bathing is especially crucial during our menstrual periods, where poor hygiene (mostly infrequent bathing) could lead to excessive odor. Ok, you don't have to shower every day, but we think you should. Take Care Of Your Lady Parts
Though the vagina is a self-cleaning organ, you must make an effort to regularly clean your intimate region with water, while only using mild and appropriate cleansers. However, it is essential to note that the vagina has susceptible skin, and using cleansers with strong chemicals can irritate it. To facilitate proper vagina health, always wear comfortable clothing, and be wary of public toilets. Also, during the period of menstruation, maintain proper hygiene by using high-quality tampons and pads like Cora tampons. Steps To Better Vagina Health
Do Not Engage in Douching
Douching was predominant in the Victorian Era, and even the Queen of England used it as a means to engage in feminine hygiene. Particularly during periods of menstruation. It is a practice still used today by up to 40% of American women. However, studies show that douching is not so great for your health. Vaginal douching increases the risk of women developing bacterial vaginosis by a whopping five times. But that’s not all, because douching also increases the risk of women getting cervical cancer. A better alternative to approach cleanliness during periods is to allow clear water to run over your lady parts. Also, regularly changing your tampons and wearing breathable tampons is a safer option when it comes to keeping things fresh down there. Shave. But Shave Carefully
Shaving off the hair down there is the in-thing today, and some consider it fashionable, in line with removing other hair on your body.

In 2007, the National Public Radio reported that not all Americans value cleanliness. Based on reports, just 66 percent of males remember to wash their hands when necessary; women did better at 88 percent. However, in 2013, The New York Times reported the contrary. It states that Americans might be too obsessed with hygiene; this obsession is brought about by advertising. But obsessed or not, there is no debate that hygiene is important. Neglecting hygiene results in hygiene-related diseases, and this is proven by research. What is hygiene? Hygiene is a general term used to describe the things we do to keep ourselves healthy through cleanliness. There are different types of hygiene: personal and environmental. Personal hygiene is aimed at an individual’s cleanliness. It includes taking care of the body through washing and bathing and keeping all parts of it clean. The hair, teeth, feet, and nails are part of a person’s body that must be kept clean at all times. Personal hygiene also covers grooming.

This is why Americans regularly practice taking a shower, brushing their teeth, changing their clothes, and using deodorants or antiperspirants: to prevent getting that stinky smell. One can say that having personal hygiene is also a sign of respect.

Domestic or home hygiene involves taking care of the home’s cleanliness by using cleaning agents and storing food and waste disposal. Domestic hygiene also includes making sure that households pest like rats and roaches do not invade the home.

Community hygiene also involves controlling one’s contribution to water and air pollution. How important is hygiene?

The simple act of washing hands can help kill the virus; however, the university reminds people that this act must be done regularly and thoroughly. Aside from preventing diseases and medical conditions, proper personal hygiene improves self-esteem and social relationships. Hence, we can conclude that hygiene is not only important for physical wellness but also social and mental wellness. Best hygiene practices
Most of the hygiene practices must already be a daily routine. However, for some who have forgotten, here are quick reminders on improving personal hygiene and overall wellness. As consistently mentioned above, washing hands is crucial to avoid spreading disease to yourself and other people. Whenever you do a “dirty job” like taking out the trash and picking out clothes, you should wash your hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds. A good thing is to sing “Happy Birthday” while washing hands. Just like washing your hands is important, washing your intimate parts is important, too. Having a bidet toilet seat can help in that extra fresh feeling when using the toilet. It can prevent UTI, too. Using bidets ensures that bacteria is removed from the body; this bacteria is responsible for urinary tract infections. Taking regular showers can cleanse the whole body. It helps remove dirt and dead skin cells in one’s body that ultimately leads to disease spread prevention. After taking a shower, wear clean clothes; dirty clothes are good breeding grounds for bacteria. Oral hygiene is also important.

Answer: No! Let’s face it, we travelers put up with a lot of aggravation on the road: lost baggage, missing passports, loud hostels, etc. . . . And we see a lot of things that bother us around the world: obnoxious tourists, environmental degradation, the plight of the world’s poor. But there’s one thing that annoys us the most, and which is constantly on our minds. Yes, I’m talking about your underwear. How many times have you, midway through your trip, with nary a laundry machine to be had, thought to yourself, “I wish I didn’t have to change my underwear so darn often!”\nWell, you are in luck, for our nation’s best and brightest scientists, chemical engineers, microbiologists, and PHD-toting eggheads have put aside some time (finally!) from their — let’s face it, kind of fruitless — endeavors such as finding a cure for HIV/AIDS, solving economic disparity, and addressing climate change, and finally tackled that age-old world issue: the irritation of changing your underwear. I introduce to you the Give-N-Go underwear from ExOficio: the world’s first underwear that does not need to be washed (very often). To you, the intrepid traveler, who asks, “Why do I need to change my underwear so often?”, ExOficio says, “Don’t!”\nThese space-age undies’ tag line, in Draper-esque fashion are: “17 countries. 6 Weeks. One pair of underwear. Okay, maybe two.” But we know they really mean one, right? A look at their package reveals what exactly these bad boys do: “[Give-N-Go’s are] high performance and low maintenance. Treated with Aegis Microbe Shield they’re odor resistant and perfect for tricky climates and active adventures.” Please, no more selling is necessary. You had me at the words “Microbe Shield.”\nAnd forget the Parisian runways, this line of underwear (and I’m not making this up) is advertised as being both “field tested and approved” by the African Wildlife Foundation, an organization you may not have realized was so intimately involved in the world of haute coutre. But let’s not take their word for it, let’s take a look at some of the (incredibly) non-anonymous customer reviews left on the underwear’s Amazon page (And for those keeping score, there were 28 five-star, one four-star, and only one one-star reviews). One very proud owner remarked, “You can live on two pairs of these — wash one at night, wear the other. Wrap it in a towel, stomp dry — should be ready in a few hours.” And here you’ve just been using your towel for your body all this time. And how about this astonished user: “Care for this item is almost too simple. I wash mine in the bathroom sink with a very small amount of detergent and hang dry for a few hours and they are ready to go again.” Oh to be that bathroom-goer lucky enough to get to use that sink right after him. (Well, at least he said he uses detergent.) And finally, where there’s a happy underwear wearer, there’s a happy mom. This from a proud mother who got her entire family in on the act: “This item was purchased for my son who was traveling to another country. He thanked me so much upon his return. He was with a group that was camping for several weeks and said this boxer brief was the most comfortable to wear, the most convenient to launder and quickest to dry. I then purchased one for another son who travels; he agrees.” It’s stories like these that get recounted during funeral eulogies and around the buffet table at wakes by bereaved children; this mother has certainly fulfilled her parental duties.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:cf33f244-213e-42f9-91db-92167a2ada02>']}, {'passage': ""How to maintain personal hygiene on a trek!

A hole deeper than this will slow down the decomposition process since the decomposing bacteria are present in the upper layer of soils. - Do not use wet wipes. They are non-biodegradable. If you have to use anything, use toilet paper. Make sure you dump the toilet paper along with your feces. Cover your dump with dry leaves and soil after making your business. Use of water though is best. - When Aunt Flow arrives on the trek, disposing off tampons is a common concern for women but that doesn’t mean there is no solution. Make sure you dispose off your used pads and tampons in a ziplock bag which you discard off once back from the trek. - Always remember to clean your hand with hand sanitizer after doing your business lest you should get hand to mouth infection. 2. Changing clothes on the trek\nHow often should you change clothes on trek? If it is a long trek, it is wise option to rotate your clothes. Segregate your hiking clothes and camping clothes. After you reach the camping site, change into clean and dry clothing. Your sweaty clothes from hiking can end up giving you body rashes and bad odor. Sleeping with soiled clothes on in your sleeping bag can really make you uncomfortable. Plus, your sleeping will bag will start to stink too. Next day, when you resume trekking, you can change back into your trekking clothes. Avoid changing into a different pair of clothes in sub-zero temperatures on the treks like Bali Pass and Goecha La unless absolutely necessary. 3. How to take a dry bath\n“Bathe twice a day to be really clean, once a day to be passably clean, once a week to avoid being a public menace.” ~Anthony Burgess\nYou are lucky if you stumble upon a lake or pond on the trek and the weather is just right to take a quick dip in the water. If not, you can always take a dry bath. All you need to do is wipe yourself thoroughly before you change into a new set of clothes. To give yourself a quick dry bath:\n- Use a damp towel and give yourself a sponge bath. You can also use wet wipes to wipe yourself clean. But make sure you collect them in your trash bag instead of throwing it off in the mountains. - Clean the troubling areas like groin, armpits, spaces between toes, and inner thighs with alcohol-based hand sanitizer. - Do not use a deodorant to hide your body odor. Its sweet smell attracts wildlife. Also, the aerosols in your deodorant pollute the air. It’s better you leave it at home. - Change your clothes in the daytime when the temperature is comparatively warm. Working up a sweat on the trek is always wow.

Traditionally we are the primary caregivers in our families. We prepare food, care for the kids, and ensure the house is clean. In some cases, we are the breadwinner of the family too, having to handle our family responsibilities while working a job or two.

It states that Americans might be too obsessed with hygiene; this obsession is brought about by advertising. But obsessed or not, there is no debate that hygiene is important. Neglecting hygiene results in hygiene-related diseases, and this is proven by research. What is hygiene? Hygiene is a general term used to describe the things we do to keep ourselves healthy through cleanliness. There are different types of hygiene: personal and environmental. Personal hygiene is aimed at an individual’s cleanliness. It includes taking care of the body through washing and bathing and keeping all parts of it clean. The hair, teeth, feet, and nails are part of a person’s body that must be kept clean at all times. Personal hygiene also covers grooming.

It is also protecting them from hygiene-related diseases that one might carry because of lack of hygiene. Environmental hygiene has two categories: domestic and community hygiene. Domestic or home hygiene involves taking care of the home’s cleanliness by using cleaning agents and storing food and waste disposal. Domestic hygiene also includes making sure that households pest like rats and roaches do not invade the home.

                ""text"": ""Almost everyone absolutely loves camping. It allows you to get away from the city and into the outdoors, which isn\u2019t just fun, it literally helps with mental health! Humans have spent more time outside in the elements than they have indoors, which is absolutely insane to think about. One of the main questions that comes up when people are new to camping is \u201chow do I stay clean?\u201d On the surface, this concern is a bit laughable. Going camping requires that you accept the fact that you\u2019re going to get a little dirty. But how dirty is too dirty? How do you manage your personal hygiene while you\u2019re camping? Well, the first thing that you need to know about staying clean while camping is to consistently change your clothes, specifically your socks and underwear. While it might seem trivial, changing those clothing items every day will go a long way in maintaining your personal hygiene throughout your camping trip! Why Is Changing Your Clothing Important? One of the most important things that you can do while camping is changing your clothes. By changing your clothes, you are stripping away a source for harmful germs and parasites from sticking you your body! This is especially true of socks. Changing your socks regularly can literally be a matter of life and death! Don\u2019t believe me? Let\u2019s look at history to learn about why it\u2019s important to change your socks to stay clean while camping. During World War I, the fighting was absolutely horrific. Millions of people were killed from bombs and bullets, but what was even more terrible to troop welfare was the fact that they were living in trenches that were constantly full of water and mud. Even the most waterproof modern boot couldn\u2019t stand up to the conditions that the WWI infantryman had to endure. Every day that the troops were on the front lines, they were living in the muck and water that never drained properly from the trenches. As a result, many couldn\u2019t keep their feet dry! This resulted in hundreds of thousands on all sides of the conflict to be medivacked off of the frontlines. Why? Their feet had literally been rubbed off! The condition that disabled so many troops from front line combat was known as \u201ctrench foot.\u201d Trench foot occurs when your feet are consistently wet and can result in incredibly sore feet at best and feet literally rotting off the bone at worst! After so many days of being on the front lines and not being able to keep their feet dry, troops literally couldn\u2019t walk any more due to how painful it was. Some even had to have their feet amputated because of how much flesh had rotted away! In some cases, people died from infections that went untreated. So please, please, be sure to change your socks when you go camping! Another great reason to change your clothing is that it gives you an opportunity to check yourself and your camping partners for parasites and bugs that might have attached themselves to your skin. One of the most common and often overlooked parasites is the tick. Ticks are common almost all throughout the world and can be incredibly harmful if they aren\u2019t addressed quickly. For example, ticks along the east coast of the US are known to transmit a debilitating disease known as Lyme Disease. Lyme Disease leaves those who are infected with it with years of dealing with symptoms. Headaches, fever, chills, muscle aches, joint aches, and swollen lymph nodes are all common symptoms that those who have Lyme Disease have to deal with. If a tick attaches itself to your skin, you have about 36 hours to detect it and remove it before you need to worry about dealing with the risk of a Lyme Disease infection. When you are changing your clothes, be sure to run your fingers through your hair and all over your skin to detect any ticks that may have attached themselves to your skin. This is especially important after you have walked through a field of grass or through bushes, as those are prime tick habitats. If you do encounter a tick, be sure to remove it promptly! - The best way to remove ticks is to use a pair of tweezers. - Grab as close to the head as you possibly can and firmly pull up in a gentle manner. - Be patient here. You don\u2019t want to accidentally rip the body away while leaving the head attached. - If you do, you may accidentally squeeze everything that the tick is carrying into your body, which is what you\u2019re trying to avoid!"",

                ""text"": ""Should I Wash My Underwear While Traveling? Answer: No! Let\u2019s face it, we travelers put up with a lot of aggravation on the road: lost baggage, missing passports, loud hostels, etc. . . . And we see a lot of things that bother us around the world: obnoxious tourists, environmental degradation, the plight of the world\u2019s poor. But there\u2019s one thing that annoys us the most, and which is constantly on our minds. Yes, I\u2019m talking about your underwear. How many times have you, midway through your trip, with nary a laundry machine to be had, thought to yourself, \u201cI wish I didn\u2019t have to change my underwear so darn often!\u201d\nWell, you are in luck, for our nation\u2019s best and brightest scientists, chemical engineers, microbiologists, and PHD-toting eggheads have put aside some time (finally!) from their \u2014 let\u2019s face it, kind of fruitless \u2014 endeavors such as finding a cure for HIV/AIDS, solving economic disparity, and addressing climate change, and finally tackled that age-old world issue: the irritation of changing your underwear. I introduce to you the Give-N-Go underwear from ExOficio: the world\u2019s first underwear that does not need to be washed (very often). To you, the intrepid traveler, who asks, \u201cWhy do I need to change my underwear so often?\u201d, ExOficio says, \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d\nThese space-age undies\u2019 tag line, in Draper-esque fashion are: \u201c17 countries. 6 Weeks. One pair of underwear. Okay, maybe two.\u201d But we know they really mean one, right? A look at their package reveals what exactly these bad boys do: \u201c[Give-N-Go\u2019s are] high performance and low maintenance. Treated with Aegis Microbe Shield they\u2019re odor resistant and perfect for tricky climates and active adventures.\u201d Please, no more selling is necessary. You had me at the words \u201cMicrobe Shield.\u201d\nAnd forget the Parisian runways, this line of underwear (and I\u2019m not making this up) is advertised as being both \u201cfield tested and approved\u201d by the African Wildlife Foundation, an organization you may not have realized was so intimately involved in the world of haute coutre. But let\u2019s not take their word for it, let\u2019s take a look at some of the (incredibly) non-anonymous customer reviews left on the underwear\u2019s Amazon page (And for those keeping score, there were 28 five-star, one four-star, and only one one-star reviews). One very proud owner remarked, \u201cYou can live on two pairs of these \u2014 wash one at night, wear the other. Wrap it in a towel, stomp dry \u2014 should be ready in a few hours.\u201d And here you\u2019ve just been using your towel for your body all this time. And how about this astonished user: \u201cCare for this item is almost too simple. I wash mine in the bathroom sink with a very small amount of detergent and hang dry for a few hours and they are ready to go again.\u201d Oh to be that bathroom-goer lucky enough to get to use that sink right after him. (Well, at least he said he uses detergent.) And finally, where there\u2019s a happy underwear wearer, there\u2019s a happy mom. This from a proud mother who got her entire family in on the act: \u201cThis item was purchased for my son who was traveling to another country. He thanked me so much upon his return. He was with a group that was camping for several weeks and said this boxer brief was the most comfortable to wear, the most convenient to launder and quickest to dry. I then purchased one for another son who travels; he agrees.\u201d It\u2019s stories like these that get recounted during funeral eulogies and around the buffet table at wakes by bereaved children; this mother has certainly fulfilled her parental duties."",

                ""text"": ""When you\u2019re roughing it, you don\u2019t think of pampering yourself, yet there is no reason to completely neglect hygiene. Paying attention to your skin, hair, and teeth will certainly be appreciated by those around you on a particular backpacking or camping expedition. Whether you\u2019re camping, hiking, fishing, or backpacking, the normal rules of hygiene still apply. Here\u2019s how to keep practicing great hygiene while you\u2019re out and about in among the outdoors. Flickr Creative Common License: Archigeek\nDry socks are very valuable when venturing throughout the outdoors. A dry, clean pair of socks is so easy to find normally but not when you\u2019re miles from your sock drawer. Throw a few more pairs of socks in your sack before heading out. Regardless of your activity or destination, you\u2019ll be moving a lot and on your feet a majority of the time. Wet, dirty socks attract bacteria, which leads to a host of foot issues that can last well beyond the excursion. You can hang a pair on the outside of your pack as to quicken the drying process in emergency situations. Take along a small bottle of hand sanitizer, using it frequently after touching trees, plants, and going in lakes. You will be using your hands to cook food, clean equipment, and eat. Therefore, you\u2019ll lessen the likelihood of ingesting and coming in contact with bacteria if you make it a habit to clean your hands with the sanitizer. It\u2019s an easy way to avoid sickness, which would be unfortunate, especially while on the trip. You won\u2019t be able to take a shower but that doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t be able to keep yourself clean. Take along a package of baby wipes to use to clean your entire body. You\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised to find how refreshed and cleaner you\u2019ll feel after wiping yourself down. Nothing can replace a nice, hot shower but baby wipes do well to remove dirt and bacteria from your body parts. You can achieve the same effect with a bottle of alcohol and cotton balls but it\u2019s easier to use the wipes. You don\u2019t want to neglect your mouth and teeth because you\u2019re away from your bathroom sink. Regardless of your location, it\u2019s still important to brush, floss, and gargle with mouthwash. Place the dental essentials in your backpack. Be mindful of when spitting out your mouthwash and toothpaste. You don\u2019t want it running into a natural body of water. Also, the smell can attract wild animals so dispose of your mouthfuls a distance away from the camp. Read on the topic further if you decide to choose dental powder rather than paste. Those with long hair may want to braid or keep it up or back with a hair tie. Those who are going to be out in the wilderness for a while may want to cover oily hair with a headband. Also, running baby powder through the hair will help with soaking up some of the excess oil. You could bring a travel-size bottle of shampoo and quickly wash your hair out with the help of a bottle of water. It\u2019s necessary to know of the things you can go without in addition to minding the things you\u2019ll need. For example, you don\u2019t need to wear deodorant; in fact, it\u2019s suggested to leave it at home because the scent will help attract bugs and wild animals. The same goes for perfumes and cologne. There is no need for it in the wilderness and it can work against you. Of course, you don\u2019t want to smell dirty; that\u2019s why you\u2019ll keep your armpits clean with baby wipes and a bit of powder. You\u2019ll get used to the \u2018natural\u2019 smell of your skin after a day or two. The weight of your backpack and the number of needed items is always a concern to those who are hiking and camping. You\u2019ll want to balance packing too many clothes with knowing when to change and clean what you do bring. Replace sweaty shirts and pants each night with fresh clothing. It\u2019s best to change before going to sleep for the night. Sleeping in dirty clothes makes your sleeping bag smell and it also introduces the opportunity for rashes and skin problems. Of course, you\u2019ll want to consider the type of material. Some materials wick away sweat while feeling light on the skin. Cotton will make a sweaty shirt stick to your skin and does not feel comfortable in the rain."",

                ""text"": ""There is a tent with workout equipment, and I can run around the perimeter (9 laps = 1 mile). The shower facilities didn't work for the first few days, but are now back online, and a line of very stinky porta-johns serve as toilets, and double as a breeding ground for a race of super-flies that are unmatched in speed or tenacity by any fly I have here-to-fore encountered in my lifetime. The flies are everywhere on the tiny COP, but are highly concentrated in the bathroom area, where they torment and frustrate you to the point of tears while you try to brush your teeth. Ten or twelve will position themselves on various parts of your body, and will respond to being brushed off by simply flying a short loop and returning immediately to their original position. Their entire route never takes them more than two inches away from your body, and provides absolutely no relief. Invariably, one or two will choose to take residence on your head or face, and when brushed off, they fly directly through your field of vision before returning, just to let you know that they are still there, and that they will not be leaving any time soon. Your only defense is to continuously pace the length of the bathroom while you brush (an option unavailable while shaving), constantly shaking and kicking your legs and arms around like Michael J. Fox in a vain effort to shake off flies. Their is rarely a fruit or vegetable to be found, so the meals consist of a meat and a starch, and of course their is always plenty of cookies, muffins, and other assorted crap lying around - so the food is nutritionally terrible but on the whole it tastes okay. All in all, I have no complaints; in fact, I rather like it here. When I first arrived at my Non-Air Conditioned tent, I was a little grumpy about the disparaging accommodations, and once again wondered if the Army was ever made aware of what a \""High Valued Asset\"" that I am. I unpacked my sea-bag, and arranged my items in neat little piles on the floor under my bed, and to my horror, realized that I forgot to pack underpants! I was riddled with anxiety when I thought of spending 10 days without underpants AND without air conditioning. The sum of which is far worse than either part taken individually. The only solution I could manage was this; I would take my underpants into the shower and thoroughly rinse and ring them out, then hang them on a bed post to dry out. I considered perhaps using shampoo to supplement the cleansing process, which would certainly improve the scent, but I worried that this might lead to some uncomfortable itchiness should I fail to rinse it out completely enough so ultimately settled against it. This system allows me to wear them on alternating days, and go commando on the between days. This is day five of the cycle, making today an \""underpants day,\"" and I have realized that going without undies is not nearly as catastrophic as I had originally made out. It feels good to be free of this unnatural dependence on underpants - I am not advocating this as a lifestyle choice, and by no means to I intend to boycott underwear altogether, I just simply am not reliant on it anymore. Underwear is a crutch. Hooah. Thursday, October 16, 2008\nOnce a month or so, I receive an e-mail from someone who happened upon the blog, thanking me for giving them some insight as to what their upcoming IA deployment will be like. While I\u2019m happy that people are enjoying it, it is kind of depressing that Sailors are forced to turn to the world of ego-bloggers to get any information on what their upcoming deployment will be like. I think that shows that although the Navy has been in the IA business for about five years, they aren\u2019t getting any better at it. While I was home on leave, I spoke with my CO, and he asked me some specific questions about the IA because he was hosting some muckity-muck from the CNOs office that happened to have a heavy hand in IA tasking. Listing my grievances, I realized that the most stressful part of this whole deployment so far was the disorganization of the Navy on the front end."",

7,<urn:uuid:342a6bd4-f513-4985-ac71-95113bf5a3e7>,"We seem to be seeing a surge in new group development lately. Many of the groups coming together are activist groups focused on political, civil rights, or social justice agendas. Other groups bring members together around special interests, or are more supportive in nature. Whatever the purpose of your group effort, I thought it might be timely to talk about the process of forming a group.
While you may have thought that setting up a new group is a simple process, it might prove a bit more complicated than you thought. Group development generally involves more than just getting a group of people into the same room. All groups go through fairly predictable stages, though, so understanding those stages is a good place to start and will help you understand the process as it unfolds.
The popular model of group development stages created by Bruce Tuckman (1965) outlines four stages in the life of a group: 1) forming, 2) storming, 3) norming, and 4) performing. Some later permutations of this model also include a fifth stage, called alternatively “adjourning” or “mourning.” I’ll talk about each stage and the challenges that can arise, but first I think it’s important to consider what exactly you hope to accomplish with your group, and to do a little bit of preparation.
The first question you’ll need to answer is what it is you hope to accomplish with your group. What is your purpose? Do you have a specific project or task that needs to be completed, or a particular goal in mind? Is it intended to be a loosely organized but supportive group for members sharing a problem or concern, or does it need to be laser focused on getting a job done by deadline?
Secondly, think about who you want to have as members. If you have a specific task to accomplish, what skills will be required, and who has the needed skills? If you are hoping to address a social problem, who else might be interested in working with you? If the group will be more supportive in nature, what is the population you want to bring into the fold?
Also, consider what might be the optimal size for your group. For most task-oriented groups, 6 – 12 is a workable number. Smaller groups can be effective as well, however if you have only 3 – 4 members, absences can render your group temporarily ineffective. Larger groups can also work, however they tend to require more formal organization and leadership, and it may be more difficult to harness individual creativity and foster group cohesion in a larger group. Larger groups are also more prone to forming unintended subgroups, which can promote conflict, so consider whether you really need or want a large group for your project. Bigger is not necessarily better.
Once you have an appropriately sized group of the right people devoted to a common cause or purpose, you are ready to begin. Set up your meeting time and place, and get to work!
The forming stage is the first stage of group development. This stage encompasses the first and possibly several early meetings, as group members get to know each other, exchange information and ideas, and make early decisions about how they will proceed. Usually everyone is on their best behavior at the beginning. Members are checking each other out, forming opinions about the nature of the group and what their place in it may be, and trying to make a good first impression. Early group meetings tend to be cordial and to run fairly smoothly. The important work at this stage consists of forming early relationships, delineating why you are there, and deciding how you will move forward as a group. While this stage may be pleasant, you don’t want to stay here indefinitely. If a group stalls here, it may be a signal that members don’t feel comfortable, or that there is conflict brewing that is not coming out into the open. It may also indicate that members are not strongly attached to the group’s purpose.
The second stage of group development–storming–involves conflict. It is at this stage that disagreements and personality conflicts start to appear, and competition for control of certain group functions arises. If you have done a good job of selecting your group members, their common purpose will help them get past this stage and move on to productive work. If not, the conflict may be more protracted. During this stage the group needs to learn how to manage their differences and cooperate towards common goals. Problems can develop if there is serious disagreement around the group’s purpose, if power struggles go unresolved, or if a single bully or a powerful subgroup sets out to impose their will on others. It is generally preferable to work through conflicts rather than ignoring or submerging them, as unresolved issues may continue to undermine the group efforts going forward.
Some group members may believe that conflict at this stage indicates something is wrong, but it is a normal stage in group development. The important thing is that conflicts are resolved constructively.
The the third stage of group development is called norming. This is when the group begins to develop their way of doing things. They settle issues around what is expected of group members, who will do what, how decisions will be made, and how differences will be managed. The group may develop formal rules, but they certainly will develop informal rules, or procedures that everybody knows are there even though they may not be openly acknowledged. Groups emerging from this stage are ready to settle down to work, and their members have a pretty good idea what is expected of them. They have also learned a few things about how to work with each other successfully. Sometimes unresolved conflicts from the storming stage re-emerge, and the group is temporarily thrust back into storming until they are resolved.
The performing stage, the fourth stage of group development, is when most of the productive work gets done. This can be brief in a temporary group formed around specific tasks, or it can go on for a lengthy period of time. A highly productive group in which there remains agreement around purpose, and in which members are committed to working together towards their mutual goals can perform well for years. There will be challenges as old members are lost, new ones are brought into the group, and occasional conflicts are resolved. There may also be new challenges when norms require updating, however a committed group may resolve them and continue to thrive. It may seem that the group must occasionally revisit an earlier stage, but it then returns to productivity. The performing stage is the reason we form groups to begin with. It is important to note, however, that it is only one stage. It is unrealistic to expect your group to perform optimally without ever going through the other stages.
Adjourning or Mourning
At some point every group comes to an end. It may be that their goals have been met and their mission accomplished. It may be that things have changed and the group no longer perceives a need to continue, or that continued performance would depend on making changes that the group members are unwilling to make. Sometimes the group makes a conscious choice to dissolve. Other times a group may just fade and become inactive over time. In some cases, the group may be dissolved involuntarily due to adverse circumstances. Regardless of how a group reaches its ending point, there may be a certain sense of loss or a period of mourning for group members. Eventually they will go their separate ways and move on to other projects. Ideally, efforts will be made to end in a positive manner, and to help group members feel good about what they have accomplished together.

### Context: We seem to be seeing a surge in new group development lately. Many of the groups coming together are activist groups focused on political, civil rights, or social justice agendas. Other groups bring members together around special interests, or are more supportive in nature. Whatever the purpose of your group effort, I thought it might be timely to talk about the process of forming a group. While you may have thought that setting up a new group is a simple process, it might prove a bit more complicated than you thought. Group development generally involves more than just getting a group of people into the same room. All groups go through fairly predictable stages, though, so understanding those stages is a good place to start and will help you understand the process as it unfolds. The popular model of group development stages created by Bruce Tuckman (1965) outlines four stages in the life of a group: 1) forming, 2) storming, 3) norming, and 4) performing. Some later permutations of this model also include a fifth stage, called alternatively “adjourning” or “mourning.” I’ll talk about each stage and the challenges that can arise, but first I think it’s important to consider what exactly you hope to accomplish with your group, and to do a little bit of preparation. The first question you’ll need to answer is what it is you hope to accomplish with your group. What is your purpose? Do you have a specific project or task that needs to be completed, or a particular goal in mind? Is it intended to be a loosely organized but supportive group for members sharing a problem or concern, or does it need to be laser focused on getting a job done by deadline? Secondly, think about who you want to have as members. If you have a specific task to accomplish, what skills will be required, and who has the needed skills? If you are hoping to address a social problem, who else might be interested in working with you? If the group will be more supportive in nature, what is the population you want to bring into the fold? Also, consider what might be the optimal size for your group. For most task-oriented groups, 6 – 12 is a workable number. Smaller groups can be effective as well, however if you have only 3 – 4 members, absences can render your group temporarily ineffective. Larger groups can also work, however they tend to require more formal organization and leadership, and it may be more difficult to harness individual creativity and foster group cohesion in a larger group. Larger groups are also more prone to forming unintended subgroups, which can promote conflict, so consider whether you really need or want a large group for your project. Bigger is not necessarily better. Once you have an appropriately sized group of the right people devoted to a common cause or purpose, you are ready to begin. Set up your meeting time and place, and get to work! The forming stage is the first stage of group development. This stage encompasses the first and possibly several early meetings, as group members get to know each other, exchange information and ideas, and make early decisions about how they will proceed. Usually everyone is on their best behavior at the beginning. Members are checking each other out, forming opinions about the nature of the group and what their place in it may be, and trying to make a good first impression. Early group meetings tend to be cordial and to run fairly smoothly. The important work at this stage consists of forming early relationships, delineating why you are there, and deciding how you will move forward as a group. While this stage may be pleasant, you don’t want to stay here indefinitely. If a group stalls here, it may be a signal that members don’t feel comfortable, or that there is conflict brewing that is not coming out into the open. It may also indicate that members are not strongly attached to the group’s purpose. The second stage of group development–storming–involves conflict. It is at this stage that disagreements and personality conflicts start to appear, and competition for control of certain group functions arises. If you have done a good job of selecting your group members, their common purpose will help them get past this stage and move on to productive work. If not, the conflict may be more protracted. During this stage the group needs to learn how to manage their differences and cooperate towards common goals. Problems can develop if there is serious disagreement around the group’s purpose, if power struggles go unresolved, or if a single bully or a powerful subgroup sets out to impose their will on others.

I then went back to Moodle to manually create the groups using such group naming conventions as animal names or comic book titles (Alpacas, The Defenders, etc. ), making the assignments based on my spreadsheet. It took time to ensure that group members hadn’t previously worked together (though this was almost impossible by the last couple of projects). This mixed solution had the added benefit of helping me sometimes find “better” fits for some group members whom I thought would benefit more by working with other students in particular. Overall, I thought working with new people mimicked how real world jobs work. We typically don’t get to choose who our team members are and so learning how to navigate such group politics and issues while working towards a common goal is invaluable. Also, it continually helped teach the valuing of assessing people’s skills and knowledge at the outset and applying that information to the project at hand. And perhaps more importantly in terms of college, it helped connect people who otherwise may have never had the opportunity of meeting one another. One of the most rewarding things about such a class is receiving an email from a former student who happens to mention still being in contact with former group-mates. So what makes a good group size? I’ve tried from 2 to 6 members early on. 2 member groups are too small–if one person was sick or decided to drop the course or just plain wasn’t working, that meant that the other person had to bear the responsibility for the entire project alone. 5 and 6 member groups are too large–mainly from a logistic perspective; that is, although I made some class time available for the groups to work on their projects, the majority of the work was done outside the classroom; accomodating that many different class and work schedules can be very difficult. I found that 3-4 people sized groups is the sweet spot (though depending on the project, even 4 can be a little too much to divide the responsibilities). This allowed groups to recover from for the absence of a member, added the brainstorming power of divergent perspectives, and perhaps more importantly, an provided the opportunity for an equitable division of labor. As I mentioned, most group work was done outside of the classroom. To get groups to thinking about potential challenges, we discussed the pros and cons of face-to-face meetings as well as synchronous and asynchronous technological tools (email, texting, video conferencing, phone calls, etc). Some groups always met face-to-face (like at the library), and some groups tried using only email. The most seemingly productive groups tended to use a combination of face-to-face meetings and distance communication tools. These groups typically began with a face-t0-face meeting, brainstorming on a project goal and developing a temporary plan and schedule. They would use this plan to set up dates/times and methods of communication. I also I created Moodle forums for each group that were only visible to their members. However, almost no groups ever used them (and even then, only initially), though this did vary from semester to semester. For assignments, I required that in addition to one hard-copy being turned in, each group member uploaded digital files to Moodle. They had to turn in the same copy; I had each member turn in a separate copy for accounting reasons. Although Moodle lets you filter the class by groups on its grading page, I want to be sure I was working with the correct people–and, it also was another way to encourage member participation by making their accountability very visible (if they were not doing the work, it would be highly unlikely that the other members would share their files). About those “Digital files”: since Microsoft Office was freely available on campus computers in the library and various labs, and since I also have my own copy of that produce, I stipulated that the file formats had to be in one of the Office file formats (such as .docx) or .rtf (rich text format). But I did not want to limit students to a particular software package, so I also allowed for any program that could save or print to a .pdf file. And in the case where some projects were more of a physical nature (the Packaging project, for example), they could take digital pictures and upload those to Moodle. Typically, most projects were created digitally, but I also felt it was helpful to see hard copy manifestations of it (again, such as the Packaging Project). This also meant that I did not teach any particular program, although I would demonstrate useful tips and tricks within Word or other tools.

Admittedly, the second half sentence “why we should communicate less” is provocative in the modern world of work, but true. But more about that later …
By the very hear-worth Podcast “Führungs auf den Punkt gebracht” by leadership coach Bernd Geropp a topic came to me, over which I wanted to blog for a long time: The ideal team size and the dangerously rising communication effort with too large teams. The magic number 7
In the Episode 165 of the podcast Bernd Geropp describes the ideal leadership span, i.e. the number of people that can be meaningfully led by a manager. The findings can be applied thereby not only to high-level personnel, but also and particularly with self-leading agile teams. He mentions an article of Professor Dr. Wolfgang Grunwald, work and industrial psychologist. It is shown that groups in the cultural history always consist of approx. 7 humans and larger groups inevitably fall into smaller groups. (For further background information I recommend the podcast or a Google search for the article “Psychologische Gesetzmäßigkeiten der Gruppenarbeit” [Psychological laws of group work].) I found the article and podcast so interesting because it’s more than 20 years old, but picks up on things I first learned in agile teams and UX:
Hick’s law and the magic 7
In UX we often speak of Hick’s Law. It describes the relationship between response time and number of choices. In short: With the number of options our reaction time increases. With about 7 options the reaction time is more than one second. This time can only be reduced by training. With UX and web designers the rule of thumb has established itself, never to offer more than 7 options e.g. in the main menu or to display at the same time. Brooks’s Law and the communication paths
Brook’s Law by the American computer pioneer Fred Brooks states that adding more people to a delayed software project will increase the implementation time, not decrease it. [pullquote align=”right” cite=”Fred Brooks” tweet=”true”]adding human resources to a late software project makes it later[/pullquote]
In addition to the difficult induction and the complex special tasks involved in software development, this is also due to the higher communication effort within the team. The non-linear growth of communication paths according to team size
In addition to the formula behind Hick’s Law, another formula is interesting. It describes the possible lines of communication of people, if everyone would have to coordinate with everyone:
n × (n-1) / 2
Communication does not increase linearly with the number of people:
- For 2 persons it is 1 connection
- For 3 persons there are 3 connections
- For 4 persons there are 6 connections
- For 10 persons there are already 45 connections! (Very impressive in this context also this graphic from Stackoverflow.) If we now take our rule of thumb discovered in Hick’s Law, we have a manageable amount of communication lines somewhere with 5-7 people, depending on how many active/extroverted participants there are. Small anecdote: I recently participated in a workshop with about 35 participants. What do you think: how many possible communication channels would that have been? I’ll tell you: 595. Agile teams and methods of communication avoidance
Communication avoidance sounds absurd at first. We are an agile team, we do dailies, we have product owners who manage stakeholders, we have extensive retrospectives. We should avoid communication? Yes! We’re already doing it! In the Wikipedia article on Brook’s Law there are a few limitations: His law dates back to 1975. Today, there are many things that actively avoid communication because they are convention:
- Scrum Meetings with fixed Timebox
- Design Patterns and Coding Guidelines, which define certain formalities at work
- Modern practices such as Continuous Integration or Iterative development make a large part of the coordination between developers superfluous or reduce it strongly. 5 Rules for effective avoidance Communication
On this basis you can summarize 5 simple rules, as well as you can reduce your communication outside of agile teams and achieve more:
- Creates standards and rules
Standard meetings like in Scrum, email rules like: “Don’t answer when you’re in CC” or “Only answer in case of emergency”. - Shared Meetings
Pick up participants individually or in small groups. Resists the temptation to coordinate everything in a big, clarifying conversation.

Note that, depending on student responses, it may happen that no group composition is perfectly optimal. Manual adaptations can sometimes help to balance groups, but in some cases it is impossible to make all to be validated. Then save a partially optimal composition or possibly test another composition with less restrictive criteria. Revision as of 23:36, 7 June 2019
Do you dream of composing groups on the basis of criteria, such as gathering students on the basis of their preference for work topics or mixing students according to their orientation ? The TeamUp activity allows the teacher to define a questionnaire and to compose groups, taking into account student responses. The TeamUp activity first enables you to compose a questionnaire with multiple choice questions with possibility of restrictions on the answers .For example, it is possible to require the student to tick exactly 2 options from the list of available options. The questionnaire is available to students on the opening date and they can respond to it. As soon as the closing date has passed, the teacher can start the group composition using four approaches :
- group similar individuals;
- disperse similar individuals;
- avoid minorities ;
- balance the skill level (based on a question with numerical options). Several criteria can be combined to compose the groups and the tool provides a diagnosis on the number of optimal groups. - 1 Create a TeamUp activity
- 2 Create a questionnaire with distribution criteria
- 3 Publish the questionnaire and collect student responses
- 4 Generate groups
- 5 Perfect repartition is not always possible
Create a TeamUp activity
- a name and an introduction to the activity to present this activity;
- an opening date from which students will be able to answer the questionnaire (as a result, the questions then can not be modified when this date is passed);
- a closing date from which student responses will no longer be allowed;
- the parameter ""Allow updating of answers"" specifies whether you allow students to modify their answers during the opening period of the questionnaire;
Create a questionnaire with distribution criteria
Go to the Questionnaire tab to build the multiple-choice questions that will allow students to provide useful information for group composition. Type your question and define the associated restrictions on the possible answers :
- none : the student can select any number of options, or none at all;
- at least one check mark : the student must select at least one option;
- exactly 1 check mark : the student must select one and only one option;
- exactly 2 check marks : the student must select exactly 2 options;
- exactly 3 check marks : the student must select exactly 3 options. When your questionnaire is finalized, you can preview it via the Preview Questions tab . For example, your questions may include the time range for student availability for group meetings (to group them), their curriculum (to mix), their gender (to avoid minorities), their preference thematic (to group them), on their average score over the past year exam (to balance the level of the groups), ... If you want your students to select several options from a list, for example to choose a discussions theme, we advise you to avoid questions that require you to make hierarchical choices (first choice, second choice, ... ). This type of question has two disadvantages :
- we can not prevent a student from making the same choice 3 times and the algorithm can only attribute this choice to him;
- the criteria based on hierarchical choices are very restrictive for the distribution algorithm, so that optimal groups are difficult to obtain and, therefore, an unfair distribution for the students. Publish the questionnaire and collect student responses
When your questionnaire is ready, you can change its opening date to make it accessible to students. Do not hesitate to invite your students to answer the questionnaire by using the Moodle Annoucements. You will be able to observe the answers evolution via the Compose groups tab : the students who answered are shown in blue while the students who have not yet responded are displayed in red . If some students do not answer the questionnaire, it do not block the groups composition. They are then randomly placed to complete the groups and you can also move them manually.

Security, Group Size, and the Human Brain
If the size of your company grows past 150 people, it’s time to get name badges. It’s not that larger groups are somehow less secure, it’s just that 150 is the cognitive limit to the number of people a human brain can maintain a coherent social relationship with. Primatologist Robin Dunbar derived this number by comparing neocortex — the “thinking” part of the mammalian brain — volume with the size of primate social groups. By analyzing data from 38 primate genera and extrapolating to the human neocortex size, he predicted a human “mean group size” of roughly 150. This number appears regularly in human society; it’s the estimated size of a Neolithic farming village, the size at which Hittite settlements split, and the basic unit in professional armies from Roman times to the present day. Larger group sizes aren’t as stable because their members don’t know each other well enough. Instead of thinking of the members as people, we think of them as groups of people. For such groups to function well, they need externally imposed structure, such as name badges. Of course, badges aren’t the only way to determine in-group/out-group status. Other markers include insignia, uniforms, and secret handshakes. They have different security properties and some make more sense than others at different levels of technology, but once a group reaches 150 people, it has to do something. More generally, there are several layers of natural human group size that increase with a ratio of approximately three: 5, 15, 50, 150, 500, and 1500 — although, really, the numbers aren’t as precise as all that, and groups that are less focused on survival tend to be smaller. The layers relate to both the intensity and intimacy of relationship and the frequency of contact. The smallest, three to five, is a “clique”: the number of people from whom you would seek help in times of severe emotional distress. The twelve to 20 group is the “sympathy group”: people with which you have special ties. After that, 30 to 50 is the typical size of hunter-gatherer overnight camps, generally drawn from the same pool of 150 people. No matter what size company you work for, there are only about 150 people you consider to be “co-workers.” (In small companies, Alice and Bob handle accounting. In larger companies, it’s the accounting department — and maybe you know someone there personally.) The 500-person group is the “megaband,” and the 1,500-person group is the “tribe.” Fifteen hundred is roughly the number of faces we can put names to, and the typical size of a hunter-gatherer society. These numbers are reflected in military organization throughout history: squads of 10 to 15 organized into platoons of three to four squads, organized into companies of three to four platoons, organized into battalions of three to four companies, organized into regiments of three to four battalions, organized into divisions of two to three regiments, and organized into corps of two to three divisions. Coherence can become a real problem once organizations get above about 150 in size. So as group sizes grow across these boundaries, they have more externally imposed infrastructure — and more formalized security systems. In intimate groups, pretty much all security is ad hoc. Companies smaller than 150 don’t bother with name badges; companies greater than 500 hire a guard to sit in the lobby and check badges. The military have had centuries of experience with this under rather trying circumstances, but even there the real commitment and bonding invariably occurs at the company level. Above that you need to have rank imposed by discipline. The whole brain-size comparison might be bunk, and a lot of evolutionary psychologists disagree with it. But certainly security systems become more formalized as groups grow larger and their members less known to each other. When do more formal dispute resolution systems arise: town elders, magistrates, judges? At what size boundary are formal authentication schemes required? Small companies can get by without the internal forms, memos, and procedures that large companies require; when does what tend to appear? How does punishment formalize as group size increase? And how do all these things affect group coherence? People act differently on social networking sites like Facebook when their list of “friends” grows larger and less intimate.

I’ve mentioned in several blog entries that I am a member of a Mastermind Group, and people often ask me a variety of questions about how my meeting is structured and run. Since I think Mastermind Groups are a wonderful tool for personal growth and connection, I’d like to share some of the details about how my group works which will help you form and run your own group. In essence, a Mastermind Group is a group that helps you become a vibrational match for your goals or your intentions. The belief is that your group members know you so well, they can tell when you are not really a vibrational match for your desire, so they will help you locate blocks or help you craft an intention that is in alignment with who you are and what you want. How many people are in the group? My group has 6 members. Sometimes someone takes a break for a few months if their schedule gets too full, if they’re traveling, or if they just need a break. Sometimes a member will bring a guest to a meeting to see if they are a good fit for the group. We generally have the guest come to a few meetings so we can get a feel for her and for her to decide if joining our group is something she’s really interested in. But generally speaking, we keep the number at 6 or 7. The number of people in the Mastermind is really up to each group, but I think 5-7 people is ideal. If the group is too big you can sometimes lose the intimate connection as people split into cliques or sub groups. Or your meetings can take 2 hours. If the group is too small you don’t get the wisdom of a larger collective, and if people are absent you could be at your meeting with just one other person. How often do you meet? My group meets every other week. Even if someone can’t make the meeting, we don’t try to find a day when everyone can make it. We stick to our schedule and whoever can come, comes. Most of the time, every member is present. It works best that way if the members are committed to attending every meeting. I think meeting once a month is not quite enough because a lot can happen in a month and if you miss even one meeting then you’re really going long without your supportive group. Meeting weekly is also a good option if everyone is comfortable meeting that often. How long are your meetings? We meet for one hour, however we have learned to reserve some time after our meeting for chatting about other things going on in our lives. During the meeting, we are all business, otherwise it’s easy to get sidetracked. Sometimes a member is going through a personal crisis, but we honor our meeting structure and then spend time after the meeting helping her with practical solutions to her problem. Is your group for women only? We tested out having men in our group but decided it changed the energy and dynamic too much, so now we’re a woman-only group. You can specify a gender or invite anyone. It all depends on what kind of energy you want to create and how compatible everyone is with each other. Compatible energy is more important than gender. Where do you meet? Our group meets at the home of one of our members. You can meet in a conference room, a park, a restaurant, or really anywhere that you can ensure privacy, because you need to be able to be emotionally intimate with your members. You can rotate the home in which you have your meetings to make it fair for everyone. How do you find members? Adding new members to my group usually happens when one of us brings a friend who we think would be interested in joining and also be a good fit for our other members. I think it’s vital that you don’t add new members if someone who is already in the group opposes the addition of a new member for whatever reason. There is a great deal of trust involved in having a Mastermind Group and if someone would feel uncomfortable with the addition of another member then it’s not worth adding the new person. If you’re just starting out, I recommend picking people who share a similar vibration to you. Perhaps a close friend. But just because someone is your friend doesn’t mean they will be a good member of a Mastermind Group. To function well, members should be emotionally mature, respect confidential personal information you may discuss at meetings, be reasonably intelligent, and kind. Pick other attributes as best suits your group’s intention (i.e. business minded, other parents, women only, etc.). What happens at the meetings themselves? We start our meetings by reading our Declarations For Mastermind which is simply a list of our group’s goals and guidelines.

Groups are extremely buzzword compliant. You get active engagement, collaboration, and become a facilitator all in one move. Well, provided you are secretly pulling the strings behind the scenes and have enough tasks to fill the time. I hypothosized about it previously, and now I think I have a good plan. It could all explode in my face and I'll have to retool, but here's how it's going to work. Week 1 and 2 are Boot Camp. This year I have Pre-Cal and Algebra II, so they're both getting it. Algebra II will be a little modified and approached differently. Several of the topics covered fit in nicely with the first few sections, others should probably wait until later, and the degree of difficulty will need to be adjusted. After Boot Camp, the class will be split into groups. Class sizes indicate that 6 groups of 5 is the way to go for me. Desk arrangement is the fun part of that one. Desks are labeled 1-5, each group is a color. I will change the groups every so often, probably at grading period end. Big picture class format:
- Instead of homework, a task will be given to each student when we start new topics
- The task will cover all items ahead of us with a large problem set, sourced from a textbook to save time
- Each group member must complete the task prior to a test, the task serves double duty as the review
- The task will cover problems that require more than one mind to figure out
- Those harder task problems will be intended for class discussion
- How and when the students complete the task is up to them, there will be some time in class for this purpose
- Tasks are pasted into a notebook, no task is accepted outside of a notebook
- Each student will keep a notebook where all tasks, warm ups, examples, ""now you try"", WCYDWT questions live
- Students will be assessed on the topics of the week frequently
This format will reign most of the time unless I have something special in mind. Calculators and voting devices will be kept in the vicinity of the group rather than in a central location to minimize foot traffic and readiness time. Grading expectations are as follows:
How I determine that 10% Group portion is still being worked out. Part of it should include assessment from the group members to add a little fear that your teammates will flunk you if you're a punk. Notebooks are collected/inspected prior to reporting periods and must have whatever tasks I feel should have been completed by then. Algebra II will be tested in a Standards Based format, so it is expected that they'll have all their test scores recorded as well. In the future, possibly second semester, I hope to find a way to award groups points as we go along, similar to what they do on Around the Horn (an ESPN show, sportswriters are voted up/down by the host based on what they say and eventually one writer ""wins""). College gave me the idea for a single, large, weekly assignment and group member evaluation, and the whole concept from my 6th grade math teacher. Lastly, randomizing and rotating is a big part of active engagement, and what does any mega nerd with an engineering degree do to address this? Popsicle sticks, right? No! Call an amazing programmer friend of yours and make an app for that (features pending):

Conducting a Table Top Job Analysis
Think of a Table Top Job Analysis (TTJA) as a systematically-organized brainstorm. This process can be used for three purposes:
- Create a list of duties for a job. - Create a list of tasks needed to perform each duty. - Identifying the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed for each task. Here’s how the process works:
- Gather a group of “experts” for a particular job. - Have each expert make their own list of that they believe the duties to be. - Starting with one person, have him/her read out loud one of the identified duties. - Others in the group will likely have that duty, as well. - As a group, decide if it is a duty or a task that fits into a larger duty. - If others have that duty on their list, come to consensus on the best wording for the duty. - Write the duty in large letters on an 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper, and tape it to the wall. - Everyone crosses that duty off their list. - Move on to the next person, have him/her read off another duty. Repeat step 4. - Continue around the room until everyone has provided a duty, then start over with the first person again and keep going around the room until everyone’s list is exhausted. - There should be between five and fourteen duties on the wall. If more than fourteen exist, look at how some of the duties could be combined so that no more than fourteen exist. - If there are less than five, it may be that some duties have been defined too broadly. Consider which ones may be too comprehensive and break them down, if needed. - Prioritize the duties by starting with three groups:
- Which are the highest priority duties? Move those to one side of the wall. - Which are the lowest priority duties? Move those to the other side of the wall. - Now that three groups exist, prioritize the duties in each group. This gives you an overall priority list. - Take each duty and repeat the Nominal Group Technique to determine each set of tasks. Instead of prioritizing each completed list, order them for optimal efficiency to perform the duty. Repeat the process, but take each task and brainstorm the necessary knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed to accomplish each task. Instead of prioritizing the KSA’s place them in the most appropriate order for people to learn how to perform each task.

Another issue of an occasional series—Dear Adrian—in which I answer questions about event design, elementary particle physics, solar hot water systems, facilitation, and anything else I might conceivably know something about. If you have a question you’d like me to answer, please contact me (don’t worry, I won’t publish anything without your permission). Here’s a great question from Australian facilitator, trainer, and coach Steve Rohan-Jones about … The Three Questions! (Check out the link if you aren’t already familiar with The Three Questions, otherwise what you are about to read won’t make much sense.) Good morning from Canberra, Adrian,
I have just read through The Power of Participation over one year after I received a signed copy from you! In short, I have a question about The Three Questions. I understand the process both in singular and multiple form (combined with round tables). From my reading, The Three Questions appears to take some time (based on the amount of participants) with only one person speaking. This appears at odds with the aim to get people engaged in conversation. I would also think – not a question just an observation – that group of 6 would be better. This would speed up the set piece of one person speaking and others listening, reduce the need for breaks and keep the energy going early in the day. Can you clarify my understanding of The Three Questions? I look forward to hearing from you. O2C Pty Ltd
Steve, I like your question because it highlights a key tension inherent in group process design: the tension between intimacy (going deep with a few) and discovery (uncovering the possibilities of the many). Let’s explore this in more detail. When people are meeting for a shared purpose, some of the potentially valuable outcomes include:
- Learning about each other. - Being and feeling heard. - Sharing with each other. - Learning from each other. The Three Questions focuses on #1, #2, and #3. I love to use it at the start of an event or workshop, because we can’t really learn effectively from our peers (#4) until we:
- have learnt what they might have to offer (#1);
- feel safe sharing with them (#2); and
- have each had an opportunity to share our own expertise and experience (#3). Because each person gets the same amount of time to share their answers to The Three Questions to a group, the time needed to run the process is proportional to the group’s size. [I’m neglecting here the few minutes needed to a) explain the process and b) provide one or two short breaks for large groups.] In practice, I’ve found this restricts the maximum effective size of a single group using The Three Questions to 60 people. If more than 60 people are present, you divide them into smaller groups and run multiple simultaneous The Three Questions sessions. Even if we have 60 people or less, we may still decide to divide our group into several smaller groups and run multiple simultaneous sessions. Typically we’ll do this when time is a constraint. For example, next month I’m leading a two-hour, ~200 person, participation techniques workshop. In order to cover multiple core techniques in two hours with this many participants, I will give them just a taste of The Three Questions by running 30+ concurrent 6-person groups. Everyone will know five former strangers much better after the ~20 minute session is over, but they won’t have learned more about the others in the room. So when designing a session or conference that includes The Three Questions, there is a trade-off between the time we have or want to allocate and group size, because we need to give each person sufficient time for meaningful sharing with their group (typically 1 – 2 minutes per person). There’s no single answer for this design decision that’s optimum for all circumstances. At a multi-day conference, for example, it makes sense to run multiple simultaneous 50-60 person Three Questions groups for a couple of hours at the start of the event. Everyone in each group will learn important information about the interests and resources of their 50-60 peers. For a monthly board meeting, once a year I might run a single session with the ten board members to remind the group of each member’s “why?”. And at a one-day peer conference with ninety participants, perhaps three simultaneous 30-person sessions would be the way to go. In some ways this design consideration is a parallel application of Jerry Weinberg’s Law of Raspberry Jam:
The wider you spread it, the thinner it gets.","[{'passage': 'We seem to be seeing a surge in new group development lately. Many of the groups coming together are activist groups focused on political, civil rights, or social justice agendas. Other groups bring members together around special interests, or are more supportive in nature. Whatever the purpose of your group effort, I thought it might be timely to talk about the process of forming a group. While you may have thought that setting up a new group is a simple process, it might prove a bit more complicated than you thought. Group development generally involves more than just getting a group of people into the same room. All groups go through fairly predictable stages, though, so understanding those stages is a good place to start and will help you understand the process as it unfolds. The popular model of group development stages created by Bruce Tuckman (1965) outlines four stages in the life of a group: 1) forming, 2) storming, 3) norming, and 4) performing. Some later permutations of this model also include a fifth stage, called alternatively “adjourning” or “mourning.” I’ll talk about each stage and the challenges that can arise, but first I think it’s important to consider what exactly you hope to accomplish with your group, and to do a little bit of preparation. The first question you’ll need to answer is what it is you hope to accomplish with your group. What is your purpose? Do you have a specific project or task that needs to be completed, or a particular goal in mind? Is it intended to be a loosely organized but supportive group for members sharing a problem or concern, or does it need to be laser focused on getting a job done by deadline? Secondly, think about who you want to have as members. If you have a specific task to accomplish, what skills will be required, and who has the needed skills? If you are hoping to address a social problem, who else might be interested in working with you? If the group will be more supportive in nature, what is the population you want to bring into the fold? Also, consider what might be the optimal size for your group. For most task-oriented groups, 6 – 12 is a workable number. Smaller groups can be effective as well, however if you have only 3 – 4 members, absences can render your group temporarily ineffective. Larger groups can also work, however they tend to require more formal organization and leadership, and it may be more difficult to harness individual creativity and foster group cohesion in a larger group. Larger groups are also more prone to forming unintended subgroups, which can promote conflict, so consider whether you really need or want a large group for your project. Bigger is not necessarily better. Once you have an appropriately sized group of the right people devoted to a common cause or purpose, you are ready to begin. Set up your meeting time and place, and get to work! The forming stage is the first stage of group development. This stage encompasses the first and possibly several early meetings, as group members get to know each other, exchange information and ideas, and make early decisions about how they will proceed. Usually everyone is on their best behavior at the beginning. Members are checking each other out, forming opinions about the nature of the group and what their place in it may be, and trying to make a good first impression. Early group meetings tend to be cordial and to run fairly smoothly. The important work at this stage consists of forming early relationships, delineating why you are there, and deciding how you will move forward as a group. While this stage may be pleasant, you don’t want to stay here indefinitely. If a group stalls here, it may be a signal that members don’t feel comfortable, or that there is conflict brewing that is not coming out into the open. It may also indicate that members are not strongly attached to the group’s purpose. The second stage of group development–storming–involves conflict. It is at this stage that disagreements and personality conflicts start to appear, and competition for control of certain group functions arises. If you have done a good job of selecting your group members, their common purpose will help them get past this stage and move on to productive work. If not, the conflict may be more protracted. During this stage the group needs to learn how to manage their differences and cooperate towards common goals. Problems can develop if there is serious disagreement around the group’s purpose, if power struggles go unresolved, or if a single bully or a powerful subgroup sets out to impose their will on others.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:342a6bd4-f513-4985-ac71-95113bf5a3e7>']}, {'passage': 'I then went back to Moodle to manually create the groups using such group naming conventions as animal names or comic book titles (Alpacas, The Defenders, etc. ), making the assignments based on my spreadsheet. It took time to ensure that group members hadn’t previously worked together (though this was almost impossible by the last couple of projects). This mixed solution had the added benefit of helping me sometimes find “better” fits for some group members whom I thought would benefit more by working with other students in particular. Overall, I thought working with new people mimicked how real world jobs work. We typically don’t get to choose who our team members are and so learning how to navigate such group politics and issues while working towards a common goal is invaluable. Also, it continually helped teach the valuing of assessing people’s skills and knowledge at the outset and applying that information to the project at hand. And perhaps more importantly in terms of college, it helped connect people who otherwise may have never had the opportunity of meeting one another. One of the most rewarding things about such a class is receiving an email from a former student who happens to mention still being in contact with former group-mates. So what makes a good group size? I’ve tried from 2 to 6 members early on. 2 member groups are too small–if one person was sick or decided to drop the course or just plain wasn’t working, that meant that the other person had to bear the responsibility for the entire project alone. 5 and 6 member groups are too large–mainly from a logistic perspective; that is, although I made some class time available for the groups to work on their projects, the majority of the work was done outside the classroom; accomodating that many different class and work schedules can be very difficult. I found that 3-4 people sized groups is the sweet spot (though depending on the project, even 4 can be a little too much to divide the responsibilities). This allowed groups to recover from for the absence of a member, added the brainstorming power of divergent perspectives, and perhaps more importantly, an provided the opportunity for an equitable division of labor. As I mentioned, most group work was done outside of the classroom. To get groups to thinking about potential challenges, we discussed the pros and cons of face-to-face meetings as well as synchronous and asynchronous technological tools (email, texting, video conferencing, phone calls, etc). Some groups always met face-to-face (like at the library), and some groups tried using only email. The most seemingly productive groups tended to use a combination of face-to-face meetings and distance communication tools. These groups typically began with a face-t0-face meeting, brainstorming on a project goal and developing a temporary plan and schedule. They would use this plan to set up dates/times and methods of communication. I also I created Moodle forums for each group that were only visible to their members. However, almost no groups ever used them (and even then, only initially), though this did vary from semester to semester. For assignments, I required that in addition to one hard-copy being turned in, each group member uploaded digital files to Moodle. They had to turn in the same copy; I had each member turn in a separate copy for accounting reasons. Although Moodle lets you filter the class by groups on its grading page, I want to be sure I was working with the correct people–and, it also was another way to encourage member participation by making their accountability very visible (if they were not doing the work, it would be highly unlikely that the other members would share their files). About those “Digital files”: since Microsoft Office was freely available on campus computers in the library and various labs, and since I also have my own copy of that produce, I stipulated that the file formats had to be in one of the Office file formats (such as .docx) or .rtf (rich text format). But I did not want to limit students to a particular software package, so I also allowed for any program that could save or print to a .pdf file. And in the case where some projects were more of a physical nature (the Packaging project, for example), they could take digital pictures and upload those to Moodle. Typically, most projects were created digitally, but I also felt it was helpful to see hard copy manifestations of it (again, such as the Packaging Project). This also meant that I did not teach any particular program, although I would demonstrate useful tips and tricks within Word or other tools.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:13974a23-5853-426c-983d-f8bd026b4fe5>']}, {'passage': 'Admittedly, the second half sentence “why we should communicate less” is provocative in the modern world of work, but true. But more about that later …\nBy the very hear-worth Podcast “Führungs auf den Punkt gebracht” by leadership coach Bernd Geropp a topic came to me, over which I wanted to blog for a long time: The ideal team size and the dangerously rising communication effort with too large teams. The magic number 7\nIn the Episode 165 of the podcast Bernd Geropp describes the ideal leadership span, i.e. the number of people that can be meaningfully led by a manager. The findings can be applied thereby not only to high-level personnel, but also and particularly with self-leading agile teams. He mentions an article of Professor Dr. Wolfgang Grunwald, work and industrial psychologist. It is shown that groups in the cultural history always consist of approx. 7 humans and larger groups inevitably fall into smaller groups. (For further background information I recommend the podcast or a Google search for the article “Psychologische Gesetzmäßigkeiten der Gruppenarbeit” [Psychological laws of group work].) I found the article and podcast so interesting because it’s more than 20 years old, but picks up on things I first learned in agile teams and UX:\nHick’s law and the magic 7\nIn UX we often speak of Hick’s Law. It describes the relationship between response time and number of choices. In short: With the number of options our reaction time increases. With about 7 options the reaction time is more than one second. This time can only be reduced by training. With UX and web designers the rule of thumb has established itself, never to offer more than 7 options e.g. in the main menu or to display at the same time. Brooks’s Law and the communication paths\nBrook’s Law by the American computer pioneer Fred Brooks states that adding more people to a delayed software project will increase the implementation time, not decrease it. [pullquote align=”right” cite=”Fred Brooks” tweet=”true”]adding human resources to a late software project makes it later[/pullquote]\nIn addition to the difficult induction and the complex special tasks involved in software development, this is also due to the higher communication effort within the team. The non-linear growth of communication paths according to team size\nIn addition to the formula behind Hick’s Law, another formula is interesting. It describes the possible lines of communication of people, if everyone would have to coordinate with everyone:\nn × (n-1) / 2\nCommunication does not increase linearly with the number of people:\n- For 2 persons it is 1 connection\n- For 3 persons there are 3 connections\n- For 4 persons there are 6 connections\n- For 10 persons there are already 45 connections! (Very impressive in this context also this graphic from Stackoverflow.) If we now take our rule of thumb discovered in Hick’s Law, we have a manageable amount of communication lines somewhere with 5-7 people, depending on how many active/extroverted participants there are. Small anecdote: I recently participated in a workshop with about 35 participants. What do you think: how many possible communication channels would that have been? I’ll tell you: 595. Agile teams and methods of communication avoidance\nCommunication avoidance sounds absurd at first. We are an agile team, we do dailies, we have product owners who manage stakeholders, we have extensive retrospectives. We should avoid communication? Yes! We’re already doing it! In the Wikipedia article on Brook’s Law there are a few limitations: His law dates back to 1975. Today, there are many things that actively avoid communication because they are convention:\n- Scrum Meetings with fixed Timebox\n- Design Patterns and Coding Guidelines, which define certain formalities at work\n- Modern practices such as Continuous Integration or Iterative development make a large part of the coordination between developers superfluous or reduce it strongly. 5 Rules for effective avoidance Communication\nOn this basis you can summarize 5 simple rules, as well as you can reduce your communication outside of agile teams and achieve more:\n- Creates standards and rules\nStandard meetings like in Scrum, email rules like: “Don’t answer when you’re in CC” or “Only answer in case of emergency”. - Shared Meetings\nPick up participants individually or in small groups.

Manual adaptations can sometimes help to balance groups, but in some cases it is impossible to make all to be validated. Then save a partially optimal composition or possibly test another composition with less restrictive criteria. Revision as of 23:36, 7 June 2019\nDo you dream of composing groups on the basis of criteria, such as gathering students on the basis of their preference for work topics or mixing students according to their orientation ? The TeamUp activity allows the teacher to define a questionnaire and to compose groups, taking into account student responses. The TeamUp activity first enables you to compose a questionnaire with multiple choice questions with possibility of restrictions on the answers .For example, it is possible to require the student to tick exactly 2 options from the list of available options. The questionnaire is available to students on the opening date and they can respond to it. As soon as the closing date has passed, the teacher can start the group composition using four approaches :\n- group similar individuals;\n- disperse similar individuals;\n- avoid minorities ;\n- balance the skill level (based on a question with numerical options). Several criteria can be combined to compose the groups and the tool provides a diagnosis on the number of optimal groups. - 1 Create a TeamUp activity\n- 2 Create a questionnaire with distribution criteria\n- 3 Publish the questionnaire and collect student responses\n- 4 Generate groups\n- 5 Perfect repartition is not always possible\nCreate a TeamUp activity\n- a name and an introduction to the activity to present this activity;\n- an opening date from which students will be able to answer the questionnaire (as a result, the questions then can not be modified when this date is passed);\n- a closing date from which student responses will no longer be allowed;\n- the parameter ""Allow updating of answers"" specifies whether you allow students to modify their answers during the opening period of the questionnaire;\nCreate a questionnaire with distribution criteria\nGo to the Questionnaire tab to build the multiple-choice questions that will allow students to provide useful information for group composition. Type your question and define the associated restrictions on the possible answers :\n- none : the student can select any number of options, or none at all;\n- at least one check mark : the student must select at least one option;\n- exactly 1 check mark : the student must select one and only one option;\n- exactly 2 check marks : the student must select exactly 2 options;\n- exactly 3 check marks : the student must select exactly 3 options. When your questionnaire is finalized, you can preview it via the Preview Questions tab . For example, your questions may include the time range for student availability for group meetings (to group them), their curriculum (to mix), their gender (to avoid minorities), their preference thematic (to group them), on their average score over the past year exam (to balance the level of the groups), ... If you want your students to select several options from a list, for example to choose a discussions theme, we advise you to avoid questions that require you to make hierarchical choices (first choice, second choice, ... ). This type of question has two disadvantages :\n- we can not prevent a student from making the same choice 3 times and the algorithm can only attribute this choice to him;\n- the criteria based on hierarchical choices are very restrictive for the distribution algorithm, so that optimal groups are difficult to obtain and, therefore, an unfair distribution for the students. Publish the questionnaire and collect student responses\nWhen your questionnaire is ready, you can change its opening date to make it accessible to students. Do not hesitate to invite your students to answer the questionnaire by using the Moodle Annoucements. You will be able to observe the answers evolution via the Compose groups tab : the students who answered are shown in blue while the students who have not yet responded are displayed in red . If some students do not answer the questionnaire, it do not block the groups composition. They are then randomly placed to complete the groups and you can also move them manually.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:b7547913-b9d3-45cd-a542-4dd476d41409>']}, {'passage': 'Security, Group Size, and the Human Brain\nIf the size of your company grows past 150 people, it’s time to get name badges. It’s not that larger groups are somehow less secure, it’s just that 150 is the cognitive limit to the number of people a human brain can maintain a coherent social relationship with. Primatologist Robin Dunbar derived this number by comparing neocortex — the “thinking” part of the mammalian brain — volume with the size of primate social groups. By analyzing data from 38 primate genera and extrapolating to the human neocortex size, he predicted a human “mean group size” of roughly 150. This number appears regularly in human society; it’s the estimated size of a Neolithic farming village, the size at which Hittite settlements split, and the basic unit in professional armies from Roman times to the present day. Larger group sizes aren’t as stable because their members don’t know each other well enough. Instead of thinking of the members as people, we think of them as groups of people. For such groups to function well, they need externally imposed structure, such as name badges. Of course, badges aren’t the only way to determine in-group/out-group status. Other markers include insignia, uniforms, and secret handshakes. They have different security properties and some make more sense than others at different levels of technology, but once a group reaches 150 people, it has to do something. More generally, there are several layers of natural human group size that increase with a ratio of approximately three: 5, 15, 50, 150, 500, and 1500 — although, really, the numbers aren’t as precise as all that, and groups that are less focused on survival tend to be smaller. The layers relate to both the intensity and intimacy of relationship and the frequency of contact. The smallest, three to five, is a “clique”: the number of people from whom you would seek help in times of severe emotional distress. The twelve to 20 group is the “sympathy group”: people with which you have special ties. After that, 30 to 50 is the typical size of hunter-gatherer overnight camps, generally drawn from the same pool of 150 people. No matter what size company you work for, there are only about 150 people you consider to be “co-workers.” (In small companies, Alice and Bob handle accounting. In larger companies, it’s the accounting department — and maybe you know someone there personally.) The 500-person group is the “megaband,” and the 1,500-person group is the “tribe.” Fifteen hundred is roughly the number of faces we can put names to, and the typical size of a hunter-gatherer society. These numbers are reflected in military organization throughout history: squads of 10 to 15 organized into platoons of three to four squads, organized into companies of three to four platoons, organized into battalions of three to four companies, organized into regiments of three to four battalions, organized into divisions of two to three regiments, and organized into corps of two to three divisions. Coherence can become a real problem once organizations get above about 150 in size. So as group sizes grow across these boundaries, they have more externally imposed infrastructure — and more formalized security systems. In intimate groups, pretty much all security is ad hoc. Companies smaller than 150 don’t bother with name badges; companies greater than 500 hire a guard to sit in the lobby and check badges. The military have had centuries of experience with this under rather trying circumstances, but even there the real commitment and bonding invariably occurs at the company level. Above that you need to have rank imposed by discipline. The whole brain-size comparison might be bunk, and a lot of evolutionary psychologists disagree with it. But certainly security systems become more formalized as groups grow larger and their members less known to each other. When do more formal dispute resolution systems arise: town elders, magistrates, judges? At what size boundary are formal authentication schemes required? Small companies can get by without the internal forms, memos, and procedures that large companies require; when does what tend to appear? How does punishment formalize as group size increase? And how do all these things affect group coherence? People act differently on social networking sites like Facebook when their list of “friends” grows larger and less intimate.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:665b930c-8f12-4762-9d6a-71bb33173374>']}, {'passage': 'I’ve mentioned in several blog entries that I am a member of a Mastermind Group, and people often ask me a variety of questions about how my meeting is structured and run. Since I think Mastermind Groups are a wonderful tool for personal growth and connection, I’d like to share some of the details about how my group works which will help you form and run your own group. In essence, a Mastermind Group is a group that helps you become a vibrational match for your goals or your intentions. The belief is that your group members know you so well, they can tell when you are not really a vibrational match for your desire, so they will help you locate blocks or help you craft an intention that is in alignment with who you are and what you want. How many people are in the group? My group has 6 members. Sometimes someone takes a break for a few months if their schedule gets too full, if they’re traveling, or if they just need a break. Sometimes a member will bring a guest to a meeting to see if they are a good fit for the group. We generally have the guest come to a few meetings so we can get a feel for her and for her to decide if joining our group is something she’s really interested in. But generally speaking, we keep the number at 6 or 7. The number of people in the Mastermind is really up to each group, but I think 5-7 people is ideal. If the group is too big you can sometimes lose the intimate connection as people split into cliques or sub groups. Or your meetings can take 2 hours. If the group is too small you don’t get the wisdom of a larger collective, and if people are absent you could be at your meeting with just one other person. How often do you meet? My group meets every other week. Even if someone can’t make the meeting, we don’t try to find a day when everyone can make it. We stick to our schedule and whoever can come, comes. Most of the time, every member is present. It works best that way if the members are committed to attending every meeting. I think meeting once a month is not quite enough because a lot can happen in a month and if you miss even one meeting then you’re really going long without your supportive group. Meeting weekly is also a good option if everyone is comfortable meeting that often. How long are your meetings? We meet for one hour, however we have learned to reserve some time after our meeting for chatting about other things going on in our lives. During the meeting, we are all business, otherwise it’s easy to get sidetracked. Sometimes a member is going through a personal crisis, but we honor our meeting structure and then spend time after the meeting helping her with practical solutions to her problem. Is your group for women only? We tested out having men in our group but decided it changed the energy and dynamic too much, so now we’re a woman-only group. You can specify a gender or invite anyone. It all depends on what kind of energy you want to create and how compatible everyone is with each other. Compatible energy is more important than gender. Where do you meet? Our group meets at the home of one of our members. You can meet in a conference room, a park, a restaurant, or really anywhere that you can ensure privacy, because you need to be able to be emotionally intimate with your members. You can rotate the home in which you have your meetings to make it fair for everyone. How do you find members? Adding new members to my group usually happens when one of us brings a friend who we think would be interested in joining and also be a good fit for our other members. I think it’s vital that you don’t add new members if someone who is already in the group opposes the addition of a new member for whatever reason. There is a great deal of trust involved in having a Mastermind Group and if someone would feel uncomfortable with the addition of another member then it’s not worth adding the new person. If you’re just starting out, I recommend picking people who share a similar vibration to you. Perhaps a close friend. But just because someone is your friend doesn’t mean they will be a good member of a Mastermind Group. To function well, members should be emotionally mature, respect confidential personal information you may discuss at meetings, be reasonably intelligent, and kind. Pick other attributes as best suits your group’s intention (i.e. business minded, other parents, women only, etc.). What happens at the meetings themselves? We start our meetings by reading our Declarations For Mastermind which is simply a list of our group’s goals and guidelines.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:1d39addb-a557-46b4-8dfd-8c87ec1567f6>']}, {'passage': 'Groups are extremely buzzword compliant.

This process can be used for three purposes:\n- Create a list of duties for a job. - Create a list of tasks needed to perform each duty. - Identifying the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed for each task. Here’s how the process works:\n- Gather a group of “experts” for a particular job. - Have each expert make their own list of that they believe the duties to be. - Starting with one person, have him/her read out loud one of the identified duties. - Others in the group will likely have that duty, as well. - As a group, decide if it is a duty or a task that fits into a larger duty. - If others have that duty on their list, come to consensus on the best wording for the duty. - Write the duty in large letters on an 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper, and tape it to the wall. - Everyone crosses that duty off their list. - Move on to the next person, have him/her read off another duty. Repeat step 4. - Continue around the room until everyone has provided a duty, then start over with the first person again and keep going around the room until everyone’s list is exhausted. - There should be between five and fourteen duties on the wall. If more than fourteen exist, look at how some of the duties could be combined so that no more than fourteen exist. - If there are less than five, it may be that some duties have been defined too broadly. Consider which ones may be too comprehensive and break them down, if needed. - Prioritize the duties by starting with three groups:\n- Which are the highest priority duties? Move those to one side of the wall. - Which are the lowest priority duties? Move those to the other side of the wall. - Now that three groups exist, prioritize the duties in each group. This gives you an overall priority list. - Take each duty and repeat the Nominal Group Technique to determine each set of tasks. Instead of prioritizing each completed list, order them for optimal efficiency to perform the duty. Repeat the process, but take each task and brainstorm the necessary knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed to accomplish each task.

If you have a question you’d like me to answer, please contact me (don’t worry, I won’t publish anything without your permission). Here’s a great question from Australian facilitator, trainer, and coach Steve Rohan-Jones about … The Three Questions! (Check out the link if you aren’t already familiar with The Three Questions, otherwise what you are about to read won’t make much sense.) Good morning from Canberra, Adrian,\nI have just read through The Power of Participation over one year after I received a signed copy from you! In short, I have a question about The Three Questions. I understand the process both in singular and multiple form (combined with round tables). From my reading, The Three Questions appears to take some time (based on the amount of participants) with only one person speaking. This appears at odds with the aim to get people engaged in conversation. I would also think – not a question just an observation – that group of 6 would be better. This would speed up the set piece of one person speaking and others listening, reduce the need for breaks and keep the energy going early in the day. Can you clarify my understanding of The Three Questions? I look forward to hearing from you. O2C Pty Ltd\nSteve, I like your question because it highlights a key tension inherent in group process design: the tension between intimacy (going deep with a few) and discovery (uncovering the possibilities of the many). Let’s explore this in more detail. When people are meeting for a shared purpose, some of the potentially valuable outcomes include:\n- Learning about each other. - Being and feeling heard. - Sharing with each other. - Learning from each other. The Three Questions focuses on #1, #2, and #3. I love to use it at the start of an event or workshop, because we can’t really learn effectively from our peers (#4) until we:\n- have learnt what they might have to offer (#1);\n- feel safe sharing with them (#2); and\n- have each had an opportunity to share our own expertise and experience (#3). Because each person gets the same amount of time to share their answers to The Three Questions to a group, the time needed to run the process is proportional to the group’s size. [I’m neglecting here the few minutes needed to a) explain the process and b) provide one or two short breaks for large groups.] In practice, I’ve found this restricts the maximum effective size of a single group using The Three Questions to 60 people. If more than 60 people are present, you divide them into smaller groups and run multiple simultaneous The Three Questions sessions. Even if we have 60 people or less, we may still decide to divide our group into several smaller groups and run multiple simultaneous sessions. Typically we’ll do this when time is a constraint. For example, next month I’m leading a two-hour, ~200 person, participation techniques workshop. In order to cover multiple core techniques in two hours with this many participants, I will give them just a taste of The Three Questions by running 30+ concurrent 6-person groups. Everyone will know five former strangers much better after the ~20 minute session is over, but they won’t have learned more about the others in the room. So when designing a session or conference that includes The Three Questions, there is a trade-off between the time we have or want to allocate and group size, because we need to give each person sufficient time for meaningful sharing with their group (typically 1 – 2 minutes per person). There’s no single answer for this design decision that’s optimum for all circumstances. At a multi-day conference, for example, it makes sense to run multiple simultaneous 50-60 person Three Questions groups for a couple of hours at the start of the event. Everyone in each group will learn important information about the interests and resources of their 50-60 peers. For a monthly board meeting, once a year I might run a single session with the ten board members to remind the group of each member’s “why?”. And at a one-day peer conference with ninety participants, perhaps three simultaneous 30-person sessions would be the way to go. In some ways this design consideration is a parallel application of Jerry Weinberg’s Law of Raspberry Jam:\nThe wider you spread it, the thinner it gets.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:3a372d4c-14cc-4c24-822c-59b5c99768e2>']}]","{

Shall we go for a big team or small is the new big in projects? are questions popping up at the design phase. The biggest team I managed had 20 people and the smallest \u2013 3. The Palm Jumeirah Island mega project had teams commensurate with the scale of the project. On the face of it, larger teams get more done. Yet, there is evidence that individuals in big groups actually perform worse. It is the \u201csocial loafing\u201d syndrome: \u201csomeone else will do it. why bother?\u201d. It is known as \u201cRingelmann effect\u201c. Although it may not manifest in a construction project, I would think, when your client is a Sheikh . So how many is just right? Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has the \u201ctwo pizzas rule\u201d: if a team can\u2019t be fed by two pizzas, it\u2019s too large. According to Katherine Klein from Wharton University, the widely accepted ideal size for a working team is five people \u201cIf you go beyond five people the team starts to lose individual performance, while teams smaller than 5 people can experience awkward team dynamics and skills gaps\u201d. Smaller groups appear more agile, robust and pro-active. Yet, research shows, disagreements happen more in smaller teams than bigger teams. It could be the frequency of interaction. Or just the fragility of egos. Through trial and error, I noticed three rules of the thumb valid on my mind in approaching the decision on the number of team members:\n1. If the project needs legal advice and financial services/accounting and a candidate is competent in both, take him/her on both roles, for a blend of skills. It will save time and effort, which will be otherwise spent on collaboration or its failure. 2. The size of the team may not be a constant during the lifespan of a project. Each stage may need additions or downsizing. It does not preclude you from inviting everyone to celebrate the project completion and you can order more than two pizzas on this occasion. 3. Size matters, but more important are the quality and performance of the team members. Stay humble in expanding your kingdom and bet on quality. Find the best and nurture them. Not with pizzas.

As we all know from our rather bitter experiences that productivity has an inverse relation with the number of people in the meeting; more people in a meeting, less productivity they show! You often face difficulty to decide about the number of people in your group. This idea can be extended to any group like your study group or any project team. But how to decide what number is \u2018too large\u2019 or \u2018too little\u2019? Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos has an interesting theory, which he calls the \u2018two-pizza rule.\u201d This suggests that you should never have a meeting or a team where two full sized pizzas are not able to feed the entire group. This means that your group should not be more than 8 to 10 people at most; the number of people that can be satisfied with two pizzas. In fact, Bezos particular doesn\u2019t like meetings, and only holds them when necessary. \u201c[Bezos] wanted a de-centralized, even disorganized company where independent ideas would prevail over groupthink,\u201d writes Richard Brandt at The Wall Street Journal. The rule is still followed by almost every team at Amazon, with the team members ranging from 10-12 at most. Of course, if your team consists of engineers, you will probably waste more time in deciding the dynamics of the rule than your actual project!

                ""text"": ""Board sizes vary widely. A 1999 survey by the National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) found that slightly less than half of corporate boards had seven to nine members, with the remaining boards scattered evenly on either side of that range. Is there an optimal board size? One meta-analysis of studies of board size in particular found a statistically significant correlation between increased board size and improved financial performance. Dan R. Dalton, Number of Directors and Financial Performance: A Meta-Analysis, 42 Acad. Mgmt. J. 674, 676 (1999). Given the potential influence of confounding variables, however, it does not seem safe to draw firm conclusions from that survey. Other studies, moreover, are to the contrary. See, e.g., Sanjai Bhagat & Bernard Black, The Uncertain Relationship Between Board Composition and Firm Performance, 54 Bus. Law. 921, 941-42 (1999) (summarizing studies); Theodore Eisenberg et al., Larger Board Size and Decreasing Firm Value in Small Firms, 48 J. Fin. Econ. 35, 36 (1998) (finding a significant negative correlation between board size and firm profitability in small and medium Finnish firms). Up to a certain point, large boards can have a number of benefits. Larger size may facilitate the board\u2019s resource-gathering function, since a larger number of directors will usually translate into more interlocking relationships with other organizations that may be useful in providing resources such as customers, clients, credit, and supplies. Larger boards with diverse interlocks are also likely to include a greater number of specialists\u2014such as investment bankers or attorneys\u2014who bring special expertise to the table. On the other hand, a number of considerations suggest that small boards may be preferable. Large boards tend to be contentious and fragmented, which would reduces their ability collectively to monitor and discipline senior management. In such cases, the senior managers can affirmatively take advantage of the board through \u201ccoalition building, selective channeling of information, and \u2018dividing and conquering.\u2019 \u201d Jeffrey A. Alexander et al., Leadership Instability in Hospitals: The Influence of Board-CEO Relations and Organizational Growth and Decline, 38 Admin. Sci. Q. 74, 79 (1993). The social loafing phenomenon also suggests an upper limit on efficient group size. In a famous 1913 study which measured how hard subjects pulled a rope, members of two-person teams pulled to only ninety-three percent of their individual capacity, members of trios pulled to only eighty-five percent, and members of groups of eight pulled to only forty-nine percent. See David A. Kravitz & Barbara Martin, Ringelmann Rediscovered: The Original Article, 50 J. Personality & Soc. Psychol. 936, 938 (1986). This phenomenon is partially attributable to the difficulty of coordinating group effort as size increases. (Too many cooks spoil the soup.) Social loafing is also attributable, however, to the difficulty of motivating members of a group where identification and/or measurement of individual productivity are difficult\u2014i.e., where the group functions as a production team. As group size grows, for example, the number of nonparticipants (loafers) likely increases. In addition, larger boards may inhibit the formation of the sorts of close-knit relationships by which groups constrain agency costs. A Korn/Ferry survey of corporate directors found: \""According to respondents, the optimal board size is two inside directors and eight outside.\"" Sounds about right to me."",

There are some questions you need to ask yourself before deciding how many members should be in your mastermind group:\n- How much total time is available at each meeting? Meetings need to have a begin and end time, and many meetings that run over 90 minutes can run out of steam without frequent breaks. Yet breaks also cause interruption of the energy levels. So first decide how long each meeting will be, then go on to Question 2. - How much time should each member get to be in the \u201chot seat\u201d to talk about their problem, challenge or decision? Members need time to first verbalize their situation before masterminding can begin in earnest. Some members are quick and can sum it up in five minutes or less. Others need 10-15 minutes just to set the stage. THEN you need time to mastermind after that. We did an experiment in one of my mastermind group meetings recently: we had a non-timed meeting, just to see what would naturally occur. Thirty minutes per member was our average time for each hot seat. - What other items are on your agenda? Remember that your meeting typically includes some sort of opening and closing, as well as possible guest speakers, training or other events. Allow time for those in your agenda, then plan accordingly. In my mastermind groups, I tend to look for 4-6 members per group. Less than four and the energy level can drop (though I know several very successful mastermind groups with three members in them! ), and more than six members will probably cause you to run out of time. However, if you\u2019re doing half-day or full-day meetings, you may be able to include more members."",

The important thing is that the teams are comfortable and don t stumble over each other too often. Optimal team size Most books I ve read claim that the optimal team size is somewhere around 5 9 people. From what I ve seen so far I can only agree. Although I d say 3 8 people. In fact, I believe it is worth taking some pains to achieve teams of that size. Let s say you have a single Scrum team of 10 people. Consider ejecting the two weakest team members. Oops, did I just say that? Let s say you have two different products, with one 3-person team per product, and both are moving too slow. It might be a good idea to combine them into one single 6-person team responsible for both products. In that case let one of the two product owners go (or give him an advisory role or something). 112 102 SCRUM AND XP FROM THE TRENCHES Let s say you have a single 12-person Scrum team, because the code base is in such a crappy state that there is no way for 2 different teams to work on it independently. Put some serious effort into fixing the code base (instead of building new features) until you get to a point where you can split the team. This investment will probably pay off quite quickly. Synchronized sprints or not? Let s say you have three Scrum teams working on the same product. Should their sprints be synchronized, i.e. start and end together? Or should they overlap? Our first approach was to have overlapping sprints (with respect to time). This sounded nice. At any given moment in time there would be an ongoing sprint just about to end and a new sprint just about to begin. The product owner s workload would be evenly spread out over time. There would be releases flowing continuously out of the system. Demos every week. Hallelujah. Yeah, I know, but it really did sound convincing at the time! We had just started doing this when I one day had the opportunity to talk to Ken Schwaber (in conjunction with my Scrum certification). He pointed out that this was a bad idea, that it would be much better to\n113 HOW WE HANDLE MULTIPLE SCRUM TEAMS 103 synchronize the sprints. I don t remember his exact reasons, but after some discussion I was convinced. This is the solution we ve used ever since, and never regretted it. I ll never know if the overlapping sprints strategy would have failed, but I think so. The advantage of synchronized sprints is: There is a natural time at which to rearrange teams between sprints! With overlapping sprints, there is no way to rearrange teams without disturbing at least one team in mid-sprint. All teams could work towards the same goal in a sprint and do sprint planning meetings together, which leads to better collaboration between teams. Less administrative overhead, i.e. fewer sprint planning meetings, sprint demos, and releases. Why we introduced a team lead role Let s say we have a single product with three teams. The red guy labeled P is Product Owner. The black guys labeled S are Scrum Masters. The rest are grunts... er... respectable team members. With this constellation, who decides which people should be in which teams? The product owner? The three Scrum masters together? Or does every person get to select his own team? But then what if everyone wants to be in team 1 (because Scrum master 1 is so good looking)? 114 104 SCRUM AND XP FROM THE TRENCHES What if it later turns out that it is really not possible to have more than two teams working in parallel on this code base, so we need to transform this into two 9-person teams instead of three 6-person teams. That means 2 Scrum masters. So which one of the current 3 Scrum masters will be relieved of his title? In many companies these will be quite sensitive issues. It is tempting to let the product owner do the allocation and reassignment of people. But that isn t really product owner stuff right? The product owner is the domain expert who tells the team in which direction they should run. He should not really have to get involved in the nitty gritty details. Especially since he is a chicken (if you ve heard the chicken and pig metaphor, otherwise google up chickens and pigs ). We ve solved this by introducing a team lead role. This corresponds to what you might call Scrum of Scrums master or the boss or main Scrum master etc."",

### Context: One of my friends always says “I’m sorry.” It doesn’t matter what I say, but for whatever her reasons are, she only answers with sorry. I realize that it’s probably because she just doesn’t know what to say, but I also have come to feel the frustration that comes with hearing the same response all the time. That’s when I began to think about why people say that they’re sorry, and I’ve come to realize that it’s probably one of the most over-used words. Why is it that we are at a loss for words, that we turn to an expression that is used to show sympathy or to apologize? Sorry is defined as feeling regret, sadness, and pity. The last thing that I want to feel is pity from anyone, but it still doesn’t answer the reason why sorry is so often overused. It’s a reflex that sends the wrong message. It’s not said that when we need to own up to being responsible for our actions, we rely on saying sorry to fill the gap of awkwardness when being told of news that affects someone else. Sorry finds its way into statements that don’t have anything to do with feeling remorse. One of the most concerning issues is that apologizing too much can lead to a person sounding insincere. As a strategy for being polite, sorry has become the go-to word for keeping the peace without sounding too passive-aggressive. By changing to words such as thank you, we immediately can change the tone of our message to one that is positive. Apologizing for simply existing isn’t enough. Instead, changing the words we use can make a difference in our conversations and our relationships with each other is more beneficial, and what is meant to be. Rather than staying in the habit of saying sorry, we can practice using words that give real meaning to what we are feeling and putting the unnecessary apologies away for when they are most needed. Over-apologizing has become a common way of reacting to those around us. What many may not realize is how we lessen its meaning and its value, the more that we say we’re sorry. It can also show low-esteem and that we fear confrontation. Remembering that unless we have done something that is our fault, finding words that express what the other person may need, such as encouragement, could be the better option than saying I’m sorry.

I recently found myself in a situation where I needed to apologize to someone I hurt. I was conflicted, my thoughts filled with self-justifying righteousness, “I am right, and I am hurt, too!” Yet at the same time, I was filled with regret, choking on unfinished words and self-reproach. “This isn’t turning out the way I want it to,” I said to myself. Ugh…the only way to get myself out of my self-inflected situation was to say, “I’m sorry.”
Apologizing is difficult, especially when the stakes are high and the hurt runs deep. It’s easy to let yourself off the hook, blaming the other person and minimizing your role in the situation. When you finally bring yourself to say the words, stress hormones flood the body creating fight or flight responses. Your brain screams, “Don’t do it! Run!” or “Get mad! Don’t go down without a fight!” It’s takes everything in your power to go through with it. Your mind spins as you think of the million ways to express yourself. But in the end, it’s worth it. When you apologize, it allows space for both you and the other person to move forward, to let go, to forgive. It will make you and the other person feel better. So how do you apologize the right way? Write Down the Outcomes You Want
Before you go into a high stress situation, know what you want to get out of it. Write down your desired outcomes and keep them handy during the conversation; it will help you stay on track if the person responds emotionally and you can review them if you find yourself getting emotional or making excuses. Examples of outcomes might be to repair a damaged relationship, defuse an emotional situation, or simply to own your part in a conflict. Check Your Emotions. Choose How You Want to Feel
Emotions don’t have to dictate your feelings and reactions. Even when they are strong, you can still choose how you want to feel. You can choose to feel compassion, relief, or ownership. Or you can also choose to feel angry, justified, or shameful. It’s up to you to determine your outlook on the situation, so check your emotions and choose to see the bright side of apologizing. Apologize. Own it. Don’t Over Explain Your Actions
It’s best to just say, “I am sorry; I own what I did.” Most people don’t want to hear excuses because they water down the apology and make it feel insincere. Sometimes though, it may be appropriate to explain your side, but only do it to help the person forgive, not to minimize your role in what happened. Over explaining sounds like excuse making. Express Regret, Be Specific
In addition to saying, “I’m sorry,” you should express regret for hurting the other person. For example, “I regret hurting you; it was wrong of me to blame you and it damaged our relationship. Our relationship is important to me and I understand that I have to earn your trust back.” This validates the person’s feelings which is what most people want out of an apology. Being specific brings a tone of sincerity and it shows you understand how your actions affected the person. Ask Questions and Listen
Remember, the person you are apologizing to isn’t there to only hear you out. Give him or her the opportunity to respond. Ask questions to draw out meaningful dialogue, listen carefully and don’t get defensive. Make Commitments and Keep Them
After you’ve apologized and expressed regret, make a commitment to change your behavior. Outline what you are going to do differently and follow through. Everyone makes mistakes but there is nothing worse than repeating it because you didn’t change your behavior. Trust can be rebuilt quickly if you demonstrate that you’ve learned from what happened. Smile, Say Thank You and Leave
At the end of your apology, smile. Smiling makes everyone feel better and it releases tension. Thank the person for listening and then leave. Most people need time to process and hanging around afterwards doesn’t allow the space required to do so. Following these steps will help you deliver a sincere, meaningful apology and will start the process of forgiveness. As famous cartoonist Lynn Johnson famously wrote, “An apology is the super glue of life. It can repair just about anything.”

They're Not Just for Children
We learned them as children, but no mater your age these essential words are effortless to say and convey a wealth of meaning to others. They have a powerful ability to create positive interactions, so look for opportunities to use them every day. Using “please” expresses both respect and consideration for those with whom we’re interacting because it changes a command into a request. It sets the tone for whatever follows and is one of most important universal manners. “Thank You” and “You’re Welcome”
Most people know to express their thanks for gifts, favors, awards, and the like. But we sometimes fail to recognize and show appreciation for the everyday courtesies that come our way, such as when someone holds the door or lets us go ahead in line. Expressing thanks for these little services is a hallmark of civility. When someone says, “thank you,” the best response is, “you’re welcome.” Don’t be bashful—accept the credit for your kindness. It’s subtle, but an “it was nothing” is actually saying that you place no value on what you did. By accepting thanks graciously you can also encourage the “thank-you” habit. “Excuse me,” “pardon me,” and “I beg your pardon” all express your awareness that you’ve inconvenienced someone else. Make it a habit to excuse yourself whenever you do the following:
- Make a necessary interruption: “Excuse me, but you have a phone call.”
- Make a request: “Excuse me, but this is the non-smoking section.”
- Acknowledge an error: “Excuse me. I didn’t realize that you were already waiting in line.”
- Acknowledge a faux pas, such as burping: “Excuse me.”
- Leave a conversation: “Excuse me, I wish I could chat longer, but I have to leave now.”
- Get up from the table: “Please excuse me.”
Making and accepting apologies gracefully are acts of courtesy and maturity, and they are important for matters both big and small. Sincere apologies can defuse volatile situations; it’s hard for most people to remain angry with someone who takes responsibility for his own actions. “I’m sorry” is also one of the simplest and often kindest ways to express sympathy or regret. A job loss, an illness, a death in the family, or the loss of a pet are all times when you might say sorry. At these times, keep it simple—you don’t need to elaborate if you aren’t sure what else to say.

Knowing the secrets of a really good apology can mean the difference between this:
Most of us learned to apologize back when we were in preschool and as far as I can tell, few people have upgraded their approach since then. Remember the drill? You whacked some girl with your shovel or you yanked the cat’s tail and before you had time to enjoy what you’d done some looming grown-up was pressuring you to say you were sorry. So you took a deep breath and, contrite or not, you managed to squeak out a barely audible “sorry.”
With that, thank goodness, the ordeal was over. An apology like this is lacking, well… just about everything that a Class-A apology needs. An apology is worth very little if it’s been extracted, rather than given. If your M.O. is to “demand” an apology, rethink your strategy. A well-executed, sincere apology feels like a gift to the receiver. Once you’ve experienced the real thing, you’ll clearly know the difference. Worse still is an apology that is an attack or a criticism in disguise. Here are some common apology blunders to eliminate from your repertoire:
“I’m sorry that you’re so sensitive.”
“I’m sorry if…”
“I’m sorry that it pissed you off when I did the thing you always do.”
“You want an apology? Fine, here’s an apology.”
Any of these moves sound familiar? If so, I bet you aren’t winning rave reviews for your effort. Ready for an alternative? Step 1- Mean what you say
The key ingredient to making a truly standout apology is that you actually have to be sorry. This is essential. You may not have been sorry for stealing your sister’s cupcake when you were six. But by the time you’re, say, forty-six, if you forgot to pick your daughter up from her saxophone lesson or you didn’t close the sunroof and the car is knee-deep in rain, unless you’re a sociopath, chances are you feel sorry and you’re ready to say so. Step 2- Articulate exactly what it is that you’re sorry for
“I’m sorry I left the cat door unlocked… I overspent at Nordstrom’s… I forgot to pick up the dry cleaning… I drank too much at your office party… I made a joke that embarrassed you.”
I’m not suggesting that you have to wear a hair shirt or fall on your knees. I’m simply suggesting that you look yourself in the eye and be prepared to admit what you’ve done. Step 3- Self-reflect
A slightly better-than-average apology is consists of Steps 1 and 2, but if you’re going for the gold, you’ll have to do some soul-searching about what led to your misstep in the first place. One client I worked with refused to keep a calendar, insisting he didn’t need one. Yet, time and again, he missed important meetings, especially with his partner. His new and improved apology included an admission of being both dishonest with himself about his imperfect memory and inconsiderate of the impact that his self-deception had on others. Another client who was consistently late, admitted that she felt entitled to have her lateness overlooked because she was such a kind and generous mother. This, she said sheepishly, had prevented her from making any apology at all. Step 4- Seek ways to improve your performance. Even the most heartfelt and thorough apology isn’t worth much if you turn right around and do the exact same thing again. A winning apology includes a commitment to change. Sounds difficult? Consider this. We all make mistakes, but here’s no reason for your apology to be an additional one. Why not give it a try? I’d love to hear how it goes.

I got this sweet but very sad picture (above) from a friend... It made me think about the word, SORRY. How many times a day do we/I/you use this word???? Sorry has all kinds of meanings:
--Grieved for the loss of some good; pained for some evil; feeling regret; -- now generally used to express light grief or affliction, but formerly often used to express deeper feeling. --Melancholy; dismal; gloomy; mournful; (She is in a sorry mood today!) --Poor; mean; worthless; (That is a sorry excuse.). I can only speak for myself, but I know that I seem to constantly use the word.. I 'am' a pleaser --especially to my sweet husband, and whenever I think I've done (or do) something crazy or stupid, I apologize BIGTIME. ""I'm sorry that I walk so slowly."" ""I am sorry that I complain about my aches and pains so much."" I feel so sorry for you---having to put up with a moody female like me."" Just think about it... I seem to apologize ALOT. Do you???? Then, there's always the problem when someone 'does' say ""I'm Sorry"" that makes one wonder if they really are sorry ---or whether they are just using words that mean nothing...???? An apology that means nothing is worse I think than no apology at all. Why is it that some people seem to apologize ALOT and others never seem to say ""I'm Sorry""???? Maybe, saying ""I'm Sorry"" has a different meaning to some than it does to others. Maybe --some of the problem has to do with 'forgiveness' (which is another blog)! All of these thoughts made me do some research on the word, SORRY. I read on www.brainyquote.com MANY different quotes from people using the word, sorry. It's interesting how the word has so many meanings and interpretations. If you want to know who said some of these quotes listed below, click HERE. It is interesting! See if you can guess which one of these quotes was said by Monica Lewinsky. (Har Har)
--I don't like it, and I'm sorry I ever had anything to do with it. --I can just tell you that I'm sorry for what happened, and I think people understand that. --Love is never having to say you are sorry. --Love in the real world means saying you're sorry 10 times a day. --And I felt sorry, and I have felt bad about what happened. --If love means never having to say you're sorry, then marriage means always having to say everything twice. --All successful people these days seem to be neurotic. Perhaps we should stop being sorry for them and start being sorry for me - for being so confounded normal. --There's no room in my life for feeling sorry for myself. --You may be sorry that you spoke, sorry you stayed or went, sorry you won or lost, sorry so much was spent. But as you go through life, you'll find - you're never sorry you were kind. --Grab a chance and you won't be sorry for a might-have-been. --Most truths are so naked that people feel sorry for them and cover them up, at least a little bit. --If you're going to do something tonight that you'll be sorry for tomorrow morning, sleep late. --Affliction comes to us, not to make us sad but sober; not to make us sorry but wise. --I can wholeheartedly apologize for not being at all sorry. And it really is the least I can do. --Let us live so that when we come to die even the undertaker will be sorry.

In these cases you contribute something else to the person you harmed. You can work it out with them to figure out what would be acceptable. You might also make restitution to show others that you are a good person. This line of thought comes from the virtue signaling ethic, and while it is great that you are doing the right thing, this is not the best way too apologize. It could lead you to think that you can just balance your bad deeds with good deeds, but this idea fails to strengthen the bonds that you have with others. Language 3: Request Forgiveness
When you request forgiveness from someone you are showing them that their opinion really matters to you, and you want to rebuild the relationship that you have with them. This follows the negotiation ethic which states that you should change your social contracts in order to benefit everyone involved in them. When you request forgiveness you recognize that your actions went against the best interest of the person you wronged, and that you should have received their permission before acting. The autonomy ethic states that you should change your values in order to bolster your identity depending on each scenario. If you request forgiveness not because you care about what the other person thinks, but to avoid retribution from them, then you are following this ethic. This request for forgiveness is not a heartfelt apology because you are only thinking of yourself. Language 4: Accept Responsibility
The responsibility ethic states that you should change your social contracts in order to help the people you lead. When you accept the responsibility for your actions you try to manage the consequences of your actions. This shows the people that you have wronged that you still want to help them. You don't want your actions to be a burden to them. The branding ethic states that you should change your values in order to best embody the things you represent. If you take responsibility of your actions so that you can save your image this is a great thing to do, but it isn't a great apology. It shows people that you care about yourself more than the people that you harmed. Language 5: Expressing Regret
When you express regret for your behavior you are being accountable to others. This follows the fifth relationship ethic which states that you must hold other people accountable for their actions by telling them how their actions have influenced others. When you express regret you tell the person you have wronged that you realize how much your actions have hurt them, and let them know that you wish you hadn't hurt them because of how much they mean to you. The self assessment ethic is the opposing ethic it states that you should evaluate your own behavior, and determine if it is actually beneficial to you. You might feel bad because you realize that your behavior is wrong and it is hurting you. But this regret is not an apology, because you don't have anyone to express it to. If you do express regret to someone because you realize that your actions are hurting yourself you will seem insincere. They will probably be like the kid with terrible drawing skills, and claim you aren't actually sorry, just sorry that your actions caught up to you. Although there are several ways to apologize, not all of the methods are necessary every time. For instance the kid whose feelings I hurt seemed to be fine after I expressed regret, and I stopped hurting his feelings. Something that I did not talk about is the relationship between personality, and apology methods. Gary Chapman's work focusses on this topic a lot, and suggests that for some people one of the apology methods will resonate with them far better than the others. One other thing that I wanted to point out is that the different apology methods are also the steps of repentance. So repentance is making an apology to God for the sins that you committed against Him. Its purpose is to initiate the rebuilding of your relationship with God. If done properly both repentance and apologizing will lead you to become a better person, and they will allow God and others to regain their trust in you.

Recently, I've heard a slew of apologies. Paula Deen said “sorry” for her racist behavior, Anthony Weiner took responsibility (kind of) for airing his privates once again, Riley Cooper swore he’d learned from his racist mistakes, and the barista at my local coffee shop apologized profusely for not having the coffee flavor I love. It seems like everyone — celebrities and regular Joes and Janes alike — has apology fever. In fact, some psychologists and business experts note the U.S. has developed what they dub an “apology culture,” in which people of all professions, from CEOs to physicians, are apologizing more frequently. Blame lawsuit culture, a society based on shame, or whatever you will: Everybody’s doing it. But do apologies actually help reconcile hurt feelings, or can they make things worse? Is there a “right” or “wrong” way to deliver an apology? Science helps us navigate America’s newest hobby. The Right Way to Say It
Whether it’s via an appearance on a morning news show, a dozen long-stemmed roses, or standing outside someone’s window with a boom box blaring Akon’s Put the Blame on Me, there are approximately a million ways to apologize. But, as we’ve learned from both public figures (think Mel Gibson and Anthony Weiner) and, most likely, our own personal experiences, not all apologies are equally effective. Unfortunately, experts haven't settled on one specific set of criteria for the ""perfect apology"". Some sources maintain there are four key components to an apology, while others claim as many as seven factors must be present in order for an apology to work. What each of these theories has in common is the idea that a meaningful apology should include clear acknowledgment and explanation of the offense, an expression of regret or shame, and a commitment to making reparations or providing compensation (whether monetary or symbolic). This doesn’t seem like rocket science, but, in fact, many apologies lack even these basic parts. When Serena Williams blasted a line judge about an unfair call at the 2009 U.S. Open, her apology was everything but apologetic, lacking a clear statement of regret and failing to address the line judge’s feelings. Though Paula Deen’s first apology was a tearful cry for forgiveness, by generalizing her actions as “mistakes I have made” and the “wrong that I have done,” she failed to say what she’s sorry for and acknowledge the feelings of the offended parties. Of course, we can't know whether the offended parties appreciated the apologies regardless. But what these examples highlight is the fact that it's easy to overlook some of the core factors in what research dubs the most meaningful ""sorry"". An apology doesn’t have to be an elaborate song and dance, but the most effective ones take more than just slapping together a few slick words and shedding some tears. Better Safe and Sorry
Even if saying “sorry” is a little tough, owning up to mistakes yields some pretty great perks. Research has found that apologies promote reconciliation between the two quarreling parties and can restore trust when the offender takes responsibility for their actions Removing the shadow of suspicion: the effects of apology versus denial for repairing competence-versus integrity-based trust violations. Kim, P.H., Ferrin, D.L., Cooper C.D., et al. Department of Management and Organization, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA. Journal of Applied Psychology, 2004; 89(1):104-18. . A sincere apology can produce positive health effects for the victim, including a reduction in anger-induced high blood pressure Influence of apologies and trait hostility on recovery from anger.

It would be impossible for the seven billion of us living on planet Earth not to tread on each other’s toes and rub each other up the wrong way from time to time. So, when it happens, how can we best deal with it in order to repair the situation? When to apologise (and when not to)
For some, “sorry” is the hardest word to say, while for others, the word spills from their lips with such frequency it appears to be their default response to anything that happens. If you’re in the latter category, I recommend you give some thought to why this is. What are you apologising for? Are you actually responsible for whatever has gone wrong? I’m thinking here of the times I’ve apologised for stuff that nobody could logically consider my fault, such as when my cousin came to visit me and it rained. Because as I was growing up I felt myself blamed for all sorts of things that were far outside my control, I continue to feel the impulse to seek forgiveness for practically any negative event that takes place around me. It’s an impulse I need to resist, for several reasons. An endless stream of apologies can be irritating, prompting the people on the receiving end to react in one of two ways: either they will feel obliged to keep reassuring the apologiser, when they might more usefully be concentrating on sorting out the problem, or they may buy into the grovelling and start berating the apologiser for whatever has transpired, whether or not it was her fault. Constant apologising can backfire and, in any case, the guilt and shame that accompany it are corrosive. However, this is not to say you should never apologise unless you have personally and deliberately done someone down. Not taking responsibility when the buck stops with you is even worse than assuming responsibility for events outside your control. It is the antithesis of leadership, integrity and courage – and it rarely fools anybody anyway. If I go into a busy restaurant, for example, where I have booked a table and the waiter says he has no record of my booking and there is no table available, I will feel far more mollified if he apologises and offers to make amends, rather than blaming the mistake on junior staff and shrugging it off. In some circumstances, it can take a lot of strength and confidence to apologise for an unintended consequence of something you’ve done, but in my experience it can be a healing and immensely helpful thing to do. What I have in mind here is the times my partner inadvertently upsets me. In some areas, I’m extremely sensitive and easily distressed and, when everything is fine, I accept I have to take responsibility for this and not force those around me to walk on eggshells. Once the wrong button has been pushed, though, I find it very hard not to react in childish ways, either crying and screaming in rage or withdrawing and hiding in fear. With most people, this behaviour tends simply to escalate the situation, as they feel threatened and defend themselves either by whinging (this is how it feels to me at the time) about how this isn’t their fault and I’m being unfair, or by attacking me back. I thank God that my man has the wisdom and strength to respond to me as the child I become in that state. He tells me calmly, gently and sincerely that he’s sorry for whatever it was he said or did that upset me. He puts his arms around me and we talk about it till it’s all over. He learns from each incident and never makes the same mistake twice, and gradually I’m learning too that I can trust him and need to deal with these things in a more grown-up way. How to apologise
The thing to remember when you’re apologising is that it’s for the other person’s benefit, not yours. If the purpose of your saying sorry is purely to elicit absolution from the wronged party, spare a thought in advance for how you may feel if absolution is not forthcoming. If your transgression has been serious, you may need to give the other person some time and space to process what has happened before you can expect a move towards forgiveness – but just because you don’t receive it immediately it doesn’t mean you will never get it. A meaningful apology, one that can repair the damage, obviously has to come from the heart.

By Dianna Booher
Why won’t the latest celebrity flap go away? Situations calling for a public apology come and go about once a month. Some rock star, movie actor, athlete, or politician gets caught shoplifting, driving while drunk, doing drugs, having an affair, uttering prejudicial slurs over an open mic, or taking a bribe, and the public becomes outraged about the duplicity. The public persona and principles preached don’t match the private behavior. What further enrages us about such situations is that typically the celebrity involved first takes the stance: “It’s none of your business.” When that line doesn’t work, he or she tries to make excuses, “I was drunk/stoned/conned/didn’t know that blah, blah, blah . . .”—fill in the blanks. When those excuses don’t calm the waters, the person finally comes out with a belated apology. Life goes back to normal. We once again buy the person's music, or see his movies, or go to his ball games, or elect him or her to office. There’s only one exception to this rule: If the celebrity tries to offer a pseudoapology, one with no real admission of wrongdoing. (For familiar examples, see below.) When that’s the case, the media and public chew on the story until the celebrity spits out an admission of guilt. Only then does life resume for the wronged and the harangued. Ditto at the office. People have difficulty offering an outright apology—an expression of “I’m concerned because I made a mistake/I did something wrong.” And they get the same kind of reaction as celebrities do to their pseudoapologies. What makes a good apology? 1. Admission of error, guilt, or wrongdoing. The person accepts responsibility for what was said or done and its inappropriateness, inaccuracy, weakness, hurtfulness, insensitivity, or whatever. 2. Specificity. Apologizing specifically sounds sincere. Global, blanket apologies convey lack of concern or understanding of the situation or damage caused. 3. Amends. Apologizing typically involves some attempt to make things right, some words or gesture of goodwill toward the offended person or group. Children learn these steps before they learn to count. But medical schools and hospitals are increasingly adding “How to Apologize” to their curriculum for grown-ups to learn as ways to head off malpractice lawsuits. According to a story by the Associated Press, the hospitals in the University of Michigan Health System have been encouraging doctors to apologize for mistakes. As a result, the system’s annual attorney fees, malpractice lawsuits, and notices of intent to sue have fallen dramatically. An admission of wrongdoing isn’t always appropriate, of course. But you can express regret over a situation, results, or an outcome no matter who or what caused it. Failure to admit mistakes leads to outrage. Failure to express concern leads to bitterness. Survivors, even dying victims, forgive mistakes; they don’t forgive unconcern. Concern connects people. In whatever situation—from product recall to layoffs to employee illness to accident victims to stressed colleagues—there’s tremendous power in communicating your concern. When logic causes a lapse in the relationship, emotion closes the gap. Psuedoapologies That Alienate
Apology, Plus Denial
“No, I didn’t e-mail the meeting agenda to everyone ahead of time. I apologize—I didn’t know I was supposed to do that.”
Translation: I’m not in error here. Whoever was in charge of telling me to do that screwed up—not me. Apology, Plus Good Intentions
“I’ve been putting out fires all morning ever since I came in at 6:30, but I won’t bore you with the details. So I apologize that I didn’t e-mail the meeting agenda to everyone ahead of time.”
Translation: I had good intentions, so please give me some credit for those. Besides that, I’m busier than most of you. Apology, Plus Excuse
“I apologize for not e-mailing the meeting agenda to everyone ahead of time. It’s just been my experience that nobody ever looks at them ahead of time anyway.”
Translation: There’s no reason to apologize then.

The other night my two-year-old son wanted me to get a step stool out of the closet. As I was lifting it out of the storage space, he reached for it and his littlest pinky finger got pinched in the hinge that connects the sides of the ladder as it opens. Yikes! I put the step ladder down, scooped him up and said, “I’m so sorry.”
I wanted to say, “But you need to wait til I get it all the way out.” And “That’s why these things are grown-up things.” And probably 15 other things in order to make myself feel better because I very much didn’t like being responsible for an action that pinched his finger. But I didn’t ,because I remember listening to a podcast with psychologist Harriet Lerner on Brené Brown’s Unlocking Us series that was like a master class on apologies. It was 2 years ago and so well done that I still remember some talking points. One being “When ‘but’ is tagged on to an apology, it undoes the sincerity.” If there is a genuine counter point or excuse to the apology, it needs to happen as a separate conversation. So I looked up some more details from Dr. Lerner’s book, Why Won’t You Apologize: Healing Big Betrayals and Every Day Hurts. She notes there are cultural differences when it comes to apologies. There are also gender differences – males are more likely to be non-apologizers, women are more likely to be over-apologizers. But for anyone trying to craft a sincere apology, here are some pointers she provides of things not to do:
- Saying I’m sorry you feel that way: These are apologies that don’t address what happened but instead try to target the emotions of the other party. - The “IF” apology: I’m sorry IF you thought is a weaselly effort to not own what happened. - The mystifying apology: What is it that the apologizer just said? Apologies that usually are too wordy and talk around the issue, leave the other party feeling confused. - The apology as instant expectation of forgiveness: I apologize now you must forgive me is a quid pro quo that undermines the apology as a genuine offering and not just a means to an end. - Not listening: If we don’t hear the injured party out, they will not feel heard and any apology will fall short of the entire wound. So what is a good apology? A simple statement expressing remorse for the action we are apologizing for, owning what we did, not taking more that our share of blame (because that comes across as insincere) and not trying to speak to how the other person feels. Just thumbing this book reminded me of some old wounds that I was surprised to find hadn’t fully healed over because I can still think of the poor apologies I’ve received. The down-played sorry – “I’m sorry that I called you a ‘brat’ when I was feeling crappy” when that wasn’t the word used at all. The blame-shifting excuse: “I was feeling sick, what was I to do?” when someone no-showed/no-called to the birthday party I threw for her. And the non-apology because the person who caused the injury paraded around all his own hurts as a way to claim he couldn’t be responsible for his actions. And it also brought to mind incidents where I owed an apology and fell short. The little hitches where I still feel a little guilty or ashamed because my actions were thoughtless, careless or uninformed and I never had the guts to address it properly. All these memories make the case of how important a good apology is. As Dr. Lerner says, “I believe that tendering an apology, one that is authentic and genuinely felt, helps the other person to feel validated, soothed and cared for and can restore a sense of well-being and integrity to the one who sincerely feels she or he did something wrong. Without the possibility of apology and repair, the inherently flawed experience of being human would feel impossibly tragic.”
This makes me think of one of the best apologies I’ve ever heard.","[{'passage': 'One of my friends always says “I’m sorry.” It doesn’t matter what I say, but for whatever her reasons are, she only answers with sorry. I realize that it’s probably because she just doesn’t know what to say, but I also have come to feel the frustration that comes with hearing the same response all the time. That’s when I began to think about why people say that they’re sorry, and I’ve come to realize that it’s probably one of the most over-used words. Why is it that we are at a loss for words, that we turn to an expression that is used to show sympathy or to apologize? Sorry is defined as feeling regret, sadness, and pity. The last thing that I want to feel is pity from anyone, but it still doesn’t answer the reason why sorry is so often overused. It’s a reflex that sends the wrong message. It’s not said that when we need to own up to being responsible for our actions, we rely on saying sorry to fill the gap of awkwardness when being told of news that affects someone else. Sorry finds its way into statements that don’t have anything to do with feeling remorse. One of the most concerning issues is that apologizing too much can lead to a person sounding insincere. As a strategy for being polite, sorry has become the go-to word for keeping the peace without sounding too passive-aggressive. By changing to words such as thank you, we immediately can change the tone of our message to one that is positive. Apologizing for simply existing isn’t enough. Instead, changing the words we use can make a difference in our conversations and our relationships with each other is more beneficial, and what is meant to be. Rather than staying in the habit of saying sorry, we can practice using words that give real meaning to what we are feeling and putting the unnecessary apologies away for when they are most needed. Over-apologizing has become a common way of reacting to those around us. What many may not realize is how we lessen its meaning and its value, the more that we say we’re sorry. It can also show low-esteem and that we fear confrontation. Remembering that unless we have done something that is our fault, finding words that express what the other person may need, such as encouragement, could be the better option than saying I’m sorry.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:2680b94a-483d-43fa-98fb-4a3dbf1ac6a3>']}, {'passage': 'I recently found myself in a situation where I needed to apologize to someone I hurt. I was conflicted, my thoughts filled with self-justifying righteousness, “I am right, and I am hurt, too!” Yet at the same time, I was filled with regret, choking on unfinished words and self-reproach. “This isn’t turning out the way I want it to,” I said to myself. Ugh…the only way to get myself out of my self-inflected situation was to say, “I’m sorry.”\nApologizing is difficult, especially when the stakes are high and the hurt runs deep. It’s easy to let yourself off the hook, blaming the other person and minimizing your role in the situation. When you finally bring yourself to say the words, stress hormones flood the body creating fight or flight responses. Your brain screams, “Don’t do it! Run!” or “Get mad! Don’t go down without a fight!” It’s takes everything in your power to go through with it. Your mind spins as you think of the million ways to express yourself. But in the end, it’s worth it. When you apologize, it allows space for both you and the other person to move forward, to let go, to forgive. It will make you and the other person feel better. So how do you apologize the right way? Write Down the Outcomes You Want\nBefore you go into a high stress situation, know what you want to get out of it. Write down your desired outcomes and keep them handy during the conversation; it will help you stay on track if the person responds emotionally and you can review them if you find yourself getting emotional or making excuses. Examples of outcomes might be to repair a damaged relationship, defuse an emotional situation, or simply to own your part in a conflict. Check Your Emotions. Choose How You Want to Feel\nEmotions don’t have to dictate your feelings and reactions. Even when they are strong, you can still choose how you want to feel. You can choose to feel compassion, relief, or ownership. Or you can also choose to feel angry, justified, or shameful. It’s up to you to determine your outlook on the situation, so check your emotions and choose to see the bright side of apologizing. Apologize. Own it. Don’t Over Explain Your Actions\nIt’s best to just say, “I am sorry; I own what I did.” Most people don’t want to hear excuses because they water down the apology and make it feel insincere. Sometimes though, it may be appropriate to explain your side, but only do it to help the person forgive, not to minimize your role in what happened. Over explaining sounds like excuse making. Express Regret, Be Specific\nIn addition to saying, “I’m sorry,” you should express regret for hurting the other person. For example, “I regret hurting you; it was wrong of me to blame you and it damaged our relationship. Our relationship is important to me and I understand that I have to earn your trust back.” This validates the person’s feelings which is what most people want out of an apology. Being specific brings a tone of sincerity and it shows you understand how your actions affected the person. Ask Questions and Listen\nRemember, the person you are apologizing to isn’t there to only hear you out. Give him or her the opportunity to respond. Ask questions to draw out meaningful dialogue, listen carefully and don’t get defensive. Make Commitments and Keep Them\nAfter you’ve apologized and expressed regret, make a commitment to change your behavior. Outline what you are going to do differently and follow through. Everyone makes mistakes but there is nothing worse than repeating it because you didn’t change your behavior. Trust can be rebuilt quickly if you demonstrate that you’ve learned from what happened. Smile, Say Thank You and Leave\nAt the end of your apology, smile. Smiling makes everyone feel better and it releases tension. Thank the person for listening and then leave. Most people need time to process and hanging around afterwards doesn’t allow the space required to do so. Following these steps will help you deliver a sincere, meaningful apology and will start the process of forgiveness. As famous cartoonist Lynn Johnson famously wrote, “An apology is the super glue of life. It can repair just about anything.”\nThanks for reading and as always, I appreciate comments, likes and shares!

They have a powerful ability to create positive interactions, so look for opportunities to use them every day. Using “please” expresses both respect and consideration for those with whom we’re interacting because it changes a command into a request. It sets the tone for whatever follows and is one of most important universal manners. “Thank You” and “You’re Welcome”\nMost people know to express their thanks for gifts, favors, awards, and the like. But we sometimes fail to recognize and show appreciation for the everyday courtesies that come our way, such as when someone holds the door or lets us go ahead in line. Expressing thanks for these little services is a hallmark of civility. When someone says, “thank you,” the best response is, “you’re welcome.” Don’t be bashful—accept the credit for your kindness. It’s subtle, but an “it was nothing” is actually saying that you place no value on what you did. By accepting thanks graciously you can also encourage the “thank-you” habit. “Excuse me,” “pardon me,” and “I beg your pardon” all express your awareness that you’ve inconvenienced someone else. Make it a habit to excuse yourself whenever you do the following:\n- Make a necessary interruption: “Excuse me, but you have a phone call.”\n- Make a request: “Excuse me, but this is the non-smoking section.”\n- Acknowledge an error: “Excuse me. I didn’t realize that you were already waiting in line.”\n- Acknowledge a faux pas, such as burping: “Excuse me.”\n- Leave a conversation: “Excuse me, I wish I could chat longer, but I have to leave now.”\n- Get up from the table: “Please excuse me.”\nMaking and accepting apologies gracefully are acts of courtesy and maturity, and they are important for matters both big and small. Sincere apologies can defuse volatile situations; it’s hard for most people to remain angry with someone who takes responsibility for his own actions. “I’m sorry” is also one of the simplest and often kindest ways to express sympathy or regret. A job loss, an illness, a death in the family, or the loss of a pet are all times when you might say sorry. At these times, keep it simple—you don’t need to elaborate if you aren’t sure what else to say."", 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:4212f736-c2ac-463d-bdad-c0af2f2ae6b1>']}, {'passage': 'Knowing the secrets of a really good apology can mean the difference between this:\nMost of us learned to apologize back when we were in preschool and as far as I can tell, few people have upgraded their approach since then. Remember the drill? You whacked some girl with your shovel or you yanked the cat’s tail and before you had time to enjoy what you’d done some looming grown-up was pressuring you to say you were sorry. So you took a deep breath and, contrite or not, you managed to squeak out a barely audible “sorry.”\nWith that, thank goodness, the ordeal was over. An apology like this is lacking, well… just about everything that a Class-A apology needs. An apology is worth very little if it’s been extracted, rather than given. If your M.O. is to “demand” an apology, rethink your strategy. A well-executed, sincere apology feels like a gift to the receiver. Once you’ve experienced the real thing, you’ll clearly know the difference. Worse still is an apology that is an attack or a criticism in disguise. Here are some common apology blunders to eliminate from your repertoire:\n“I’m sorry that you’re so sensitive.”\n“I’m sorry if…”\n“I’m sorry that it pissed you off when I did the thing you always do.”\n“You want an apology? Fine, here’s an apology.”\nAny of these moves sound familiar? If so, I bet you aren’t winning rave reviews for your effort. Ready for an alternative? Step 1- Mean what you say\nThe key ingredient to making a truly standout apology is that you actually have to be sorry. This is essential. You may not have been sorry for stealing your sister’s cupcake when you were six. But by the time you’re, say, forty-six, if you forgot to pick your daughter up from her saxophone lesson or you didn’t close the sunroof and the car is knee-deep in rain, unless you’re a sociopath, chances are you feel sorry and you’re ready to say so. Step 2- Articulate exactly what it is that you’re sorry for\n“I’m sorry I left the cat door unlocked… I overspent at Nordstrom’s… I forgot to pick up the dry cleaning… I drank too much at your office party… I made a joke that embarrassed you.”\nI’m not suggesting that you have to wear a hair shirt or fall on your knees. I’m simply suggesting that you look yourself in the eye and be prepared to admit what you’ve done. Step 3- Self-reflect\nA slightly better-than-average apology is consists of Steps 1 and 2, but if you’re going for the gold, you’ll have to do some soul-searching about what led to your misstep in the first place. One client I worked with refused to keep a calendar, insisting he didn’t need one. Yet, time and again, he missed important meetings, especially with his partner. His new and improved apology included an admission of being both dishonest with himself about his imperfect memory and inconsiderate of the impact that his self-deception had on others. Another client who was consistently late, admitted that she felt entitled to have her lateness overlooked because she was such a kind and generous mother. This, she said sheepishly, had prevented her from making any apology at all. Step 4- Seek ways to improve your performance. Even the most heartfelt and thorough apology isn’t worth much if you turn right around and do the exact same thing again. A winning apology includes a commitment to change. Sounds difficult? Consider this. We all make mistakes, but here’s no reason for your apology to be an additional one. Why not give it a try? I’d love to hear how it goes.

It made me think about the word, SORRY. How many times a day do we/I/you use this word???? Sorry has all kinds of meanings:\n--Grieved for the loss of some good; pained for some evil; feeling regret; -- now generally used to express light grief or affliction, but formerly often used to express deeper feeling. --Melancholy; dismal; gloomy; mournful; (She is in a sorry mood today!) --Poor; mean; worthless; (That is a sorry excuse.). I can only speak for myself, but I know that I seem to constantly use the word.. I \'am\' a pleaser --especially to my sweet husband, and whenever I think I\'ve done (or do) something crazy or stupid, I apologize BIGTIME. ""I\'m sorry that I walk so slowly."" ""I am sorry that I complain about my aches and pains so much."" I feel so sorry for you---having to put up with a moody female like me."" Just think about it... I seem to apologize ALOT. Do you???? Then, there\'s always the problem when someone \'does\' say ""I\'m Sorry"" that makes one wonder if they really are sorry ---or whether they are just using words that mean nothing...???? An apology that means nothing is worse I think than no apology at all. Why is it that some people seem to apologize ALOT and others never seem to say ""I\'m Sorry""???? Maybe, saying ""I\'m Sorry"" has a different meaning to some than it does to others. Maybe --some of the problem has to do with \'forgiveness\' (which is another blog)! All of these thoughts made me do some research on the word, SORRY. I read on www.brainyquote.com MANY different quotes from people using the word, sorry. It\'s interesting how the word has so many meanings and interpretations. If you want to know who said some of these quotes listed below, click HERE. It is interesting!

Perhaps we should stop being sorry for them and start being sorry for me - for being so confounded normal. --There\'s no room in my life for feeling sorry for myself. --You may be sorry that you spoke, sorry you stayed or went, sorry you won or lost, sorry so much was spent. But as you go through life, you\'ll find - you\'re never sorry you were kind. --Grab a chance and you won\'t be sorry for a might-have-been. --Most truths are so naked that people feel sorry for them and cover them up, at least a little bit. --If you\'re going to do something tonight that you\'ll be sorry for tomorrow morning, sleep late. --Affliction comes to us, not to make us sad but sober; not to make us sorry but wise. --I can wholeheartedly apologize for not being at all sorry.

You can work it out with them to figure out what would be acceptable. You might also make restitution to show others that you are a good person. This line of thought comes from the virtue signaling ethic, and while it is great that you are doing the right thing, this is not the best way too apologize. It could lead you to think that you can just balance your bad deeds with good deeds, but this idea fails to strengthen the bonds that you have with others. Language 3: Request Forgiveness\nWhen you request forgiveness from someone you are showing them that their opinion really matters to you, and you want to rebuild the relationship that you have with them. This follows the negotiation ethic which states that you should change your social contracts in order to benefit everyone involved in them. When you request forgiveness you recognize that your actions went against the best interest of the person you wronged, and that you should have received their permission before acting. The autonomy ethic states that you should change your values in order to bolster your identity depending on each scenario. If you request forgiveness not because you care about what the other person thinks, but to avoid retribution from them, then you are following this ethic. This request for forgiveness is not a heartfelt apology because you are only thinking of yourself. Language 4: Accept Responsibility\nThe responsibility ethic states that you should change your social contracts in order to help the people you lead. When you accept the responsibility for your actions you try to manage the consequences of your actions. This shows the people that you have wronged that you still want to help them. You don't want your actions to be a burden to them. The branding ethic states that you should change your values in order to best embody the things you represent. If you take responsibility of your actions so that you can save your image this is a great thing to do, but it isn't a great apology. It shows people that you care about yourself more than the people that you harmed. Language 5: Expressing Regret\nWhen you express regret for your behavior you are being accountable to others. This follows the fifth relationship ethic which states that you must hold other people accountable for their actions by telling them how their actions have influenced others. When you express regret you tell the person you have wronged that you realize how much your actions have hurt them, and let them know that you wish you hadn't hurt them because of how much they mean to you. The self assessment ethic is the opposing ethic it states that you should evaluate your own behavior, and determine if it is actually beneficial to you. You might feel bad because you realize that your behavior is wrong and it is hurting you. But this regret is not an apology, because you don't have anyone to express it to. If you do express regret to someone because you realize that your actions are hurting yourself you will seem insincere. They will probably be like the kid with terrible drawing skills, and claim you aren't actually sorry, just sorry that your actions caught up to you. Although there are several ways to apologize, not all of the methods are necessary every time. For instance the kid whose feelings I hurt seemed to be fine after I expressed regret, and I stopped hurting his feelings. Something that I did not talk about is the relationship between personality, and apology methods. Gary Chapman's work focusses on this topic a lot, and suggests that for some people one of the apology methods will resonate with them far better than the others. One other thing that I wanted to point out is that the different apology methods are also the steps of repentance. So repentance is making an apology to God for the sins that you committed against Him. Its purpose is to initiate the rebuilding of your relationship with God. If done properly both repentance and apologizing will lead you to become a better person, and they will allow God and others to regain their trust in you."", 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:16d71ef5-af12-46b7-9ec7-8a325f574615>']}, {'passage': 'Recently, I\'ve heard a slew of apologies. Paula Deen said “sorry” for her racist behavior, Anthony Weiner took responsibility (kind of) for airing his privates once again, Riley Cooper swore he’d learned from his racist mistakes, and the barista at my local coffee shop apologized profusely for not having the coffee flavor I love. It seems like everyone — celebrities and regular Joes and Janes alike — has apology fever. In fact, some psychologists and business experts note the U.S. has developed what they dub an “apology culture,” in which people of all professions, from CEOs to physicians, are apologizing more frequently. Blame lawsuit culture, a society based on shame, or whatever you will: Everybody’s doing it. But do apologies actually help reconcile hurt feelings, or can they make things worse? Is there a “right” or “wrong” way to deliver an apology? Science helps us navigate America’s newest hobby. The Right Way to Say It\nWhether it’s via an appearance on a morning news show, a dozen long-stemmed roses, or standing outside someone’s window with a boom box blaring Akon’s Put the Blame on Me, there are approximately a million ways to apologize. But, as we’ve learned from both public figures (think Mel Gibson and Anthony Weiner) and, most likely, our own personal experiences, not all apologies are equally effective. Unfortunately, experts haven\'t settled on one specific set of criteria for the ""perfect apology"". Some sources maintain there are four key components to an apology, while others claim as many as seven factors must be present in order for an apology to work. What each of these theories has in common is the idea that a meaningful apology should include clear acknowledgment and explanation of the offense, an expression of regret or shame, and a commitment to making reparations or providing compensation (whether monetary or symbolic). This doesn’t seem like rocket science, but, in fact, many apologies lack even these basic parts. When Serena Williams blasted a line judge about an unfair call at the 2009 U.S. Open, her apology was everything but apologetic, lacking a clear statement of regret and failing to address the line judge’s feelings. Though Paula Deen’s first apology was a tearful cry for forgiveness, by generalizing her actions as “mistakes I have made” and the “wrong that I have done,” she failed to say what she’s sorry for and acknowledge the feelings of the offended parties. Of course, we can\'t know whether the offended parties appreciated the apologies regardless. But what these examples highlight is the fact that it\'s easy to overlook some of the core factors in what research dubs the most meaningful ""sorry"". An apology doesn’t have to be an elaborate song and dance, but the most effective ones take more than just slapping together a few slick words and shedding some tears. Better Safe and Sorry\nEven if saying “sorry” is a little tough, owning up to mistakes yields some pretty great perks. Research has found that apologies promote reconciliation between the two quarreling parties and can restore trust when the offender takes responsibility for their actions Removing the shadow of suspicion: the effects of apology versus denial for repairing competence-versus integrity-based trust violations. Kim, P.H., Ferrin, D.L., Cooper C.D., et al. Department of Management and Organization, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA. Journal of Applied Psychology, 2004; 89(1):104-18. . A sincere apology can produce positive health effects for the victim, including a reduction in anger-induced high blood pressure Influence of apologies and trait hostility on recovery from anger. Anderson, J.C., Linden, W., Habra, M.E. The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. Journal of Behavioral Medicine, 2006; 29(4):347-58. . In the workplace, employees who receive effective apologies reported higher job satisfaction, less anger, and greater self-esteem When forgiving enhances psychological well-being: the role of interpersonal commitment. Karremans, J.C., Van Lange, P.A., Ouwerkerk, J.W., et al.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:d60db77b-7a3b-475a-8e01-e9bb5e695091>']}, {'passage': 'It would be impossible for the seven billion of us living on planet Earth not to tread on each other’s toes and rub each other up the wrong way from time to time. So, when it happens, how can we best deal with it in order to repair the situation? When to apologise (and when not to)\nFor some, “sorry” is the hardest word to say, while for others, the word spills from their lips with such frequency it appears to be their default response to anything that happens. If you’re in the latter category, I recommend you give some thought to why this is. What are you apologising for? Are you actually responsible for whatever has gone wrong? I’m thinking here of the times I’ve apologised for stuff that nobody could logically consider my fault, such as when my cousin came to visit me and it rained. Because as I was growing up I felt myself blamed for all sorts of things that were far outside my control, I continue to feel the impulse to seek forgiveness for practically any negative event that takes place around me. It’s an impulse I need to resist, for several reasons. An endless stream of apologies can be irritating, prompting the people on the receiving end to react in one of two ways: either they will feel obliged to keep reassuring the apologiser, when they might more usefully be concentrating on sorting out the problem, or they may buy into the grovelling and start berating the apologiser for whatever has transpired, whether or not it was her fault. Constant apologising can backfire and, in any case, the guilt and shame that accompany it are corrosive. However, this is not to say you should never apologise unless you have personally and deliberately done someone down. Not taking responsibility when the buck stops with you is even worse than assuming responsibility for events outside your control. It is the antithesis of leadership, integrity and courage – and it rarely fools anybody anyway. If I go into a busy restaurant, for example, where I have booked a table and the waiter says he has no record of my booking and there is no table available, I will feel far more mollified if he apologises and offers to make amends, rather than blaming the mistake on junior staff and shrugging it off. In some circumstances, it can take a lot of strength and confidence to apologise for an unintended consequence of something you’ve done, but in my experience it can be a healing and immensely helpful thing to do. What I have in mind here is the times my partner inadvertently upsets me. In some areas, I’m extremely sensitive and easily distressed and, when everything is fine, I accept I have to take responsibility for this and not force those around me to walk on eggshells. Once the wrong button has been pushed, though, I find it very hard not to react in childish ways, either crying and screaming in rage or withdrawing and hiding in fear. With most people, this behaviour tends simply to escalate the situation, as they feel threatened and defend themselves either by whinging (this is how it feels to me at the time) about how this isn’t their fault and I’m being unfair, or by attacking me back. I thank God that my man has the wisdom and strength to respond to me as the child I become in that state. He tells me calmly, gently and sincerely that he’s sorry for whatever it was he said or did that upset me. He puts his arms around me and we talk about it till it’s all over. He learns from each incident and never makes the same mistake twice, and gradually I’m learning too that I can trust him and need to deal with these things in a more grown-up way. How to apologise\nThe thing to remember when you’re apologising is that it’s for the other person’s benefit, not yours. If the purpose of your saying sorry is purely to elicit absolution from the wronged party, spare a thought in advance for how you may feel if absolution is not forthcoming. If your transgression has been serious, you may need to give the other person some time and space to process what has happened before you can expect a move towards forgiveness – but just because you don’t receive it immediately it doesn’t mean you will never get it. A meaningful apology, one that can repair the damage, obviously has to come from the heart.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:c095249a-c404-4d6e-b287-a37fdc17568f>']}, {'passage': ""By Dianna Booher\nWhy won’t the latest celebrity flap go away? Situations calling for a public apology come and go about once a month. Some rock star, movie actor, athlete, or politician gets caught shoplifting, driving while drunk, doing drugs, having an affair, uttering prejudicial slurs over an open mic, or taking a bribe, and the public becomes outraged about the duplicity. The public persona and principles preached don’t match the private behavior. What further enrages us about such situations is that typically the celebrity involved first takes the stance: “It’s none of your business.” When that line doesn’t work, he or she tries to make excuses, “I was drunk/stoned/conned/didn’t know that blah, blah, blah . . .”—fill in the blanks. When those excuses don’t calm the waters, the person finally comes out with a belated apology. Life goes back to normal. We once again buy the person's music, or see his movies, or go to his ball games, or elect him or her to office. There’s only one exception to this rule: If the celebrity tries to offer a pseudoapology, one with no real admission of wrongdoing. (For familiar examples, see below.) When that’s the case, the media and public chew on the story until the celebrity spits out an admission of guilt. Only then does life resume for the wronged and the harangued. Ditto at the office. People have difficulty offering an outright apology—an expression of “I’m concerned because I made a mistake/I did something wrong.” And they get the same kind of reaction as celebrities do to their pseudoapologies. What makes a good apology? 1. Admission of error, guilt, or wrongdoing. The person accepts responsibility for what was said or done and its inappropriateness, inaccuracy, weakness, hurtfulness, insensitivity, or whatever. 2. Specificity. Apologizing specifically sounds sincere. Global, blanket apologies convey lack of concern or understanding of the situation or damage caused. 3. Amends. Apologizing typically involves some attempt to make things right, some words or gesture of goodwill toward the offended person or group. Children learn these steps before they learn to count. But medical schools and hospitals are increasingly adding “How to Apologize” to their curriculum for grown-ups to learn as ways to head off malpractice lawsuits. According to a story by the Associated Press, the hospitals in the University of Michigan Health System have been encouraging doctors to apologize for mistakes. As a result, the system’s annual attorney fees, malpractice lawsuits, and notices of intent to sue have fallen dramatically. An admission of wrongdoing isn’t always appropriate, of course. But you can express regret over a situation, results, or an outcome no matter who or what caused it. Failure to admit mistakes leads to outrage. Failure to express concern leads to bitterness. Survivors, even dying victims, forgive mistakes; they don’t forgive unconcern. Concern connects people. In whatever situation—from product recall to layoffs to employee illness to accident victims to stressed colleagues—there’s tremendous power in communicating your concern. When logic causes a lapse in the relationship, emotion closes the gap. Psuedoapologies That Alienate\nApology, Plus Denial\n“No, I didn’t e-mail the meeting agenda to everyone ahead of time. I apologize—I didn’t know I was supposed to do that.”\nTranslation: I’m not in error here. Whoever was in charge of telling me to do that screwed up—not me. Apology, Plus Good Intentions\n“I’ve been putting out fires all morning ever since I came in at 6:30, but I won’t bore you with the details. So I apologize that I didn’t e-mail the meeting agenda to everyone ahead of time.”\nTranslation: I had good intentions, so please give me some credit for those. Besides that, I’m busier than most of you. Apology, Plus Excuse\n“I apologize for not e-mailing the meeting agenda to everyone ahead of time. It’s just been my experience that nobody ever looks at them ahead of time anyway.”\nTranslation: There’s no reason to apologize then."", 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:64b2a9da-3488-40e9-af22-bf7791633002>']}, {'passage': 'The other night my two-year-old son wanted me to get a step stool out of the closet. As I was lifting it out of the storage space, he reached for it and his littlest pinky finger got pinched in the hinge that connects the sides of the ladder as it opens. Yikes! I put the step ladder down, scooped him up and said, “I’m so sorry.”\nI wanted to say, “But you need to wait til I get it all the way out.” And “That’s why these things are grown-up things.” And probably 15 other things in order to make myself feel better because I very much didn’t like being responsible for an action that pinched his finger. But I didn’t ,because I remember listening to a podcast with psychologist Harriet Lerner on Brené Brown’s Unlocking Us series that was like a master class on apologies. It was 2 years ago and so well done that I still remember some talking points. One being “When ‘but’ is tagged on to an apology, it undoes the sincerity.” If there is a genuine counter point or excuse to the apology, it needs to happen as a separate conversation. So I looked up some more details from Dr. Lerner’s book, Why Won’t You Apologize: Healing Big Betrayals and Every Day Hurts. She notes there are cultural differences when it comes to apologies. There are also gender differences – males are more likely to be non-apologizers, women are more likely to be over-apologizers. But for anyone trying to craft a sincere apology, here are some pointers she provides of things not to do:\n- Saying I’m sorry you feel that way: These are apologies that don’t address what happened but instead try to target the emotions of the other party. - The “IF” apology: I’m sorry IF you thought is a weaselly effort to not own what happened. - The mystifying apology: What is it that the apologizer just said? Apologies that usually are too wordy and talk around the issue, leave the other party feeling confused. - The apology as instant expectation of forgiveness: I apologize now you must forgive me is a quid pro quo that undermines the apology as a genuine offering and not just a means to an end. - Not listening: If we don’t hear the injured party out, they will not feel heard and any apology will fall short of the entire wound. So what is a good apology? A simple statement expressing remorse for the action we are apologizing for, owning what we did, not taking more that our share of blame (because that comes across as insincere) and not trying to speak to how the other person feels. Just thumbing this book reminded me of some old wounds that I was surprised to find hadn’t fully healed over because I can still think of the poor apologies I’ve received. The down-played sorry – “I’m sorry that I called you a ‘brat’ when I was feeling crappy” when that wasn’t the word used at all. The blame-shifting excuse: “I was feeling sick, what was I to do?” when someone no-showed/no-called to the birthday party I threw for her. And the non-apology because the person who caused the injury paraded around all his own hurts as a way to claim he couldn’t be responsible for his actions. And it also brought to mind incidents where I owed an apology and fell short. The little hitches where I still feel a little guilty or ashamed because my actions were thoughtless, careless or uninformed and I never had the guts to address it properly. All these memories make the case of how important a good apology is. As Dr. Lerner says, “I believe that tendering an apology, one that is authentic and genuinely felt, helps the other person to feel validated, soothed and cared for and can restore a sense of well-being and integrity to the one who sincerely feels she or he did something wrong. Without the possibility of apology and repair, the inherently flawed experience of being human would feel impossibly tragic.”\nThis makes me think of one of the best apologies I’ve ever heard.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:1c12c398-1afb-47a6-b348-ff0ac350b841>']}]","{

Both phrases refer to a feeling of regret, but only one of them actually means \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d (even if you only sort of mean it). \u201cMy Apologies\u201d Means \u201cI\u2019m Sorry\u201d\nThe word apology comes from the Greek apologia, meaning \u201ca speech of defense.\u201d Even though apologies is technically the plural version of apology, that\u2019s not how we use it in English. My apologies is an idiom that means \u201cI feel regret\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d In this context, my apologies is short for the longer \u201cPlease accept my apologies,\u201d which has a similar meaning to \u201cI beg your pardon.\u201d\n- My apologies for bumping into you. - I sent you the wrong directions?

When Do You Use \u201cMy Apologies\u201d?

The noun phrase is a literal description of someone\u2019s statement of regret or remorse, not an idiom for \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n- In the letter, I expressed my apology for the unkind things I said. - The newspaper printed my apology in the editorial section. Unlike my apologies, my apology doesn\u2019t just relate to social situations. You also can\u2019t use my apology as a synonym for \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nYou express my apology for a specific thing you said or did; you express my apologies for breaking social rules. Is It \u201cPlease Accept My Apology\u201d or \u201cPlease Accept My Apologies\u201d? The apology vs. apologies debate gets a little tricky when you\u2019re asking someone to accept it (or them). Both \u201cPlease accept my apology\u201d and \u201cPlease accept my apologies\u201d are correct \u2014 depending on the context. - Please accept my apology for breaking your lamp. (You\u2019re apologizing for something specific.) - Please accept my apologies for being late. (You\u2019re being polite.) You may also use \u201cPlease accept my apologies\u201d when you\u2019re issuing more than one apology. For example, if you\u2019re apologizing for breaking the lamp, yelling at your friend, slamming their door, spreading rumors about them online, and crashing their car \u2014 yeah, you probably owe them more than one apology. But if it\u2019s just one offense, \u201cPlease accept my apology\u201d will do it. More Ways To Say \u201cI\u2019m Sorry\u201d\nMy apologies and my apology aren\u2019t the only statements that express remorse. If \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d isn\u2019t the right phrase, try:\n- Excuse me\n- Pardon me\n- Please forgive me\n- My bad\n- My mistake"",

The festival takes place on the last Wednesday of every August and people love to get involved. There’s something about getting soaked in Tomato juice that seems to put a great big smile on everyone’s face. Dump trucks are brought to the scene and people get to dive in and start throwing tomatoes. All the action is followed by celebrations of food and drink and dance. Over 150,000 tomatoes are used every year which come from Extremadura, a less expensive tomato.
At 11:00am canons sound by exploding tomato-packed rockets at the people to commence the event. Over 30,000 people show up for the tomato throw down. In 2013, city officials introduced an entry fee and limited the number of participants, citing concerns over safety. At 12:00p.m. the canons sound again signaling that the tomato throwing has come to its end.
Tomato Throwing Pointers:
- Participants must use goggles and gloves.
- All tomatoes must be crushed before bring thrown to avoid risk of injury.
- No other projectiles are allowed to be thrown.
The whole idea of a Tomato throwing festival wasn’t an idea at all but an angry play that took place back in August of 1945, when a group of young people went into the town square to attend the Giants and Big-Heads figures parade. The young group decided to cheer with a musician but through the excitement, caused one person to fall off of a float. This created a storm from the fallen participant getting up from the ground and hitting everyone in his path, causing an apparent uproar in the crowd.
A nearby vegetable stand stood where there were tomatoes and people automatically began pelting one another with them. This was the start of what has become known as La Tomatina. There were years after the first tomato was thrown, where locals battled with authorities and were briefly sent to jail, until the town finally got permission to throw tomatoes at one another without law enforcement intervening. Authorities finally allowed tomato throwing one day a year, making the event official.","open-ended,verbose and natural","a question to get advice or recommendations on a particular topic

According to popular belief, the festival began in 1945 when a group of young men from Bunol, a small town near Valencia, Spain, attended a parade in honor of their patron saint, Saint Louis Bertrand. As the parade was ending, the men were unhappy with the performance and decided to protest by throwing tomatoes at each other. This spontaneous act of rebellion quickly escalated, and soon, random bystanders and other townspeople joined in, turning the event into a large-scale food fight.

The following year, the same thing happened. The tomato fight had become so popular and entertaining that the townspeople decided to make it an annual event. They continued to throw tomatoes at each other every year, and by the late 1950s, the event had become officially recognized as a celebration known as La Tomatina.

Over the years, the festival has grown in size and popularity, drawing tens of thousands of participants from around the world. Today, La Tomatina is an iconic symbol of Spain's vibrant culture and love for celebrating life, fun, and communal joy.","You are a helpful assistant.

La Tomatina Spanish Festivalby Jose
Buñol is Spanish town famous for a world renowned tomato fight festival known as “La Tomatina”. Valencia, on the east coast of Spain, is a sunny Mediterranean city famous for its long sandy beaches and delicious oranges. Buñol, another city nearby located just 30 miles away in the same province is also very famous for its produce, particularly for its tomatoes. The curious thing, however, is that the small town’s notoriety does not stem from the quality of its tomatoes but rather their interesting custom of “bathing” in it. Buñol is famous around the globe for its “La Tomatina” festival which is essentially the world’s largest tomato fight. The famous tomato throwing battle is held once a year on the last Wednesday of August during the town’s one week festival. The Tomatina festival stared in the 1940s when a group of the town’s residents started a tomato fight in the town square. The tomato battle erupted and soon random pedestrians and other town people were drawn into the battle which culminated in a large food fight. When everything was said and done, the villagers had had such a fun time that they decided to celebrate the tomato fight the next year. From this day forward, the Tomatina festival has been an annual event, growing in size and popularity into the major tourist attraction of national interest that it is today in Spain. The town of Buñol in Valencia celebrates their patron saint for a full week with a variety of events including parades, fireworks, food stands and street parties. Paella cooking contests, wine and food are abundant as the town prepares for its famous tomato fight. As the Tomatina tomato fight approaches, the town’s Medieval bell tower is filled with tomatoes. The tomatoes are specially grown for the festival and are said to not be of food grade quality. When the last Wednesday of August arrives, shopkeepers and other business owners with establishments near the main square cover their windows and doors in preparation for the messy tomato event. The next step in La Tomatina festival is the arrival of the large trucks that slowly make their way up the cobblestone streets of Buñol filled with squishy ripe tomatoes on route to the town square where masses of people are awaiting the official start of the festival. However, before they can enter the main square, someone must overcome the test of the “palo jabón” or greasy pole. The goal is for someone to climb a large greased pole to knock the ham that is hanging on top to the ground. Meanwhile, the crowd below sings, dances and is sprayed with water from hoses. When someone achieves the feat, a fire is shot into the air and the tomato trucks enter the town square. A final shot rings out and the world’s largest tomato battle begins as the trucks offload their tomatoes into the Plaza del Pueblo. The Buñol tomato fight lasts about one hour with about 20,000 participants who generally use approximately 150,000 tomatoes, covering the whole city center and everyone nearby in red tomato sauce. After the event, fire trucks, participants and villagers work to clean the town center with hoses and abundant water. The result is actually a pristine shine to the cobblestone streets which are disinfected and thoroughly cleansed due to the acidity of the tomato sauce. The Buñol Tomatina festival is an event worth witnessing and participating in at least once in your lifetime. However, we recommend that you plan ahead, the small town only offers so much accommodation and the hotels in all the surrounding areas quickly fill up as the event draws near.

HISTORYThere are plenty of theories on how the legend of La Tomatina came about. The beauty of it all is no one really knows! The old man selling cups of local brew on the street corner will tell you it all began when Don Juan, a Spanish villain and notorious womanizer, was pelted with tomatoes in response to his dreadful singing voice and appalling guitar ability. The little kids trying to make some extra pocket money by looking after your backpack for the night, will swear it was started by a group local rascals raiding a fruit-stand in the town centre and hurling them at each other in a fleeting, moment of madness. And the local women eagerly selling their souvenir T-shirts will say that over 50 years ago a parade, honouring the town’s patron saint Luis Bertràn, ended in carnage when a local produce cart was crushed spilling thousands of ripe tomatoes onto the streets. In true Spanish-fiesta spirit they were promptly picked up and launched at anyone in sight. Whatever legend of La Tomatina you may hear, or choose to believe, nothing comes close to those few breathtaking hours when over 20,000 people ram the streets armed with 250,000 pounds of glorious tomatoes. Forget the term food fight, this is an all-in war! THE FESTIVALOnce a year the sleepy mountain village of Buñol comes alive with thousands of people and truckloads of tomatoes for one of the most amazing spectacles you will ever see! The morning action gets underway when a ham is placed on top of a tall, greased pole in front of the local town hall. The Tomato chaos can only get underway once someone is able to climb the slippery pole and grab the ham. It's hilarious as heaps of people try to scale this pole, climbing over each other, in order to be the illustrious one to claim the ham. Once the ham is snatched the chanting rises to a fever pitch as the trucks roll in and dump masses upon masses of ripe & ready tomatoes in the centre of town, Plaza del Pueblo, and the surrounding streets. The signal for the beginning of the throwing is the firing of five bulbous (tomato-packed rockets) out of a canon and into the air. The crowd erupts into a deafening roar and this launches everyone into a flinging and slinging frenzy. Lock and load because it's on! Forget that Sangria headache from the night before, you are now in the world's largest food fight! This is a salsa riot, this is insane!

La Tomatina is one of very few places – outside of American rom-coms – where public food fighting is not only allowed, but highly encouraged. Held annually in Bunol (roughly a 30-minute drive from Valencia), this saucy celebration offers participants just one glorious hour of red, pulpy, juicy, squishy and sticky fun. How to paint a town in tomato juice
At about 11am on August 27, 2014 (and on the last Wednesday of every August), La Tomatina explodes into Bunol with thousands of sticky visitors and flying tomatoes, and by the end of the frenzied hour, you can hardly tell the people and produce apart. It starts with the tradition where one of the punters has to climb a greasy pole and fetch a ham from the top – as soon as the ham is down, the pulpy carnage can begin. According to urban legend, it all started in the mid-1940s when a group of men wanted to partake in a local parade. Somewhat miffed, they protested by stealing tomatoes from a local stall and using them as weapons. A year later, the same thing happened, yet it wasn’t until the late 50s that the event became official. These days, Bunol’s 9,000 residents are overwhelmed by roughly 30,000 people surging in to the city. Pro tip: Book your accommodation well in advance or expect to stay in Valencia, as Bunol doesn’t have the capacity for such an influx. In fact, the festival used to attract as many as 50,000 people, but since 2013 it has been a ticketed event, capping the numbers to just 20,000 lucky tomato throwers. Tens of thousands of revellers surge through the tiny streets of Bunol, squashing, volleying and dodging approximately 117,934kg (that’s almost 2,000kg a minute!) of overripe tomatoes, according to the Huffington Post. Fire trucks come in afterwards to clean up the pooling mess on the streets, while it’s up to the soggy tomato throwers to clean off best they can either at the Bunol River, or back at their accommodation. Shopkeepers cover their storefronts in an attempt to protect their businesses from the ubiquitous tomato goo, the whole city celebrates for the week with music, parades, dancing and fireworks, and Bunol imports several trucks (or about 100 tonnes) of ripe tomatoes from Extremadura. While it may look like red chaos, there are a handful of rather important rules to keep in mind – as well as some expert advice. 1. You can’t rip shirts
2. You have to squish the tomatoes prior to throwing them
3. You can only throw tomatoes
4. You must stop at the sound of the second cannon
5. You are strongly – strongly – advised to wear goggles and gloves
6. Wear closed shoes that you don’t care too much about – thongs will only slip off, and your clothes don’t stand much of a chance of recovering from the battle
7. Bring waterproof covers for your cameras and phones, and keep keys in plastic bags under your clothes. The less you can bring with you the better, and just make sure you have comprehensive travel insurance in case those pesky tomatoes do find their way into somewhere they shouldn’t be. Check out the options available from Virgin Travel Insurance to see if they suit your needs. Do think you’re a natural born food fighter?

Every “zarramaco” has a particular purpose and collectively they tour the city of Silió hunting and banishing evil spirits. Just after studying the “coplas” – a humorous critique recalling the gatherings on the prior 12 months – comes the symbolic looking and killing on the bear.

Spain is full of amazing festivals, seemingly in every town, and Valencia’s famous Las Fallas, which begins tomorrow, ensures the Mediterranean city is known for more than just being a stopping off point for visitors to nearby La Tomatina each August. As a commemoration of Saint Joseph, hundreds of thousands–perhaps even millions–gather to enjoy fireworks, music, and burn huge paper sculptures. This practice is believed to help people start a fresh new year by burning bad thoughts and memories. Every neighborhood of Valencia has an organized group of people (the Casal faller) who host fundraising dinner parties featuring paella throughout the year, and use the money to construct a massive sculpture (falla) that will eventually be burnt in the festival. The falla is constructed according to an agreed-upon theme, which is typically a satirical shot at anything or anyone who draws the attention of the falleros. Recent editions have included George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Lady Gaga and even Shrek. These are all entered into a contest, and must be completed by March 15th to avoid facing disqualification. From there, they are placed in their respective (albeit temporary) homes during a ceremony called La Planta (the rising), where they remain until being burned. Some of the larger fallas…

The Main Event(s)
The event itself is a 5-day extravaganza, featuring a multitude of historical, religions and comedic processions. Each day begins sharply at 8am with La Despertà or, wake up call, which features brass bands marching down the street playing loud music. Close behind them are the fallers throwing large firecrackers (indeed once you’ve been here, you will no longer be surprised to hear explosions even in the middle of the night, or kids seemingly as small as babies throwing pyrotechnics). Later in the day, at exactly 2pm, comes La Mascletà, an explosive barrage of coordinated firecracker and fireworks displays (the term “las fallas” actually means “the fires” in Valencian, so this shouldn’t come as a surprise). During this, pyrotechnicians are competing for the honor of providing the final Mascletà of the festival on the night of March 19th, also known as La Nit del Foc (“The Night of Fire”). Besides these two regularly scheduled events, the days of Las Fallas are full of a variety of offerings—bullfights, parades, paella contests and even beauty pageants—and stalls everywhere selling fried goodies like pores, xurros, buyols and roasted chestnuts. Each night of the festival features a fireworks display, with each day progressively becoming grander until the main event on the 19th. A typical Mascelta crowd for Las Fallas in Valencia
On the final night of Falles, around midnight on March 19, the falles are burnt as huge bonfires. This is known as la cremà (the burning), the climax of the whole event, and the reason why the constructions are called falles (“torches”). Traditionally, the falla in the Plaça de l’Ajuntament is burned last. By this point, the whole city is like a dance party, except that instead of music there is the explosive sound of people throwing fireworks around randomly. This, of course, leads to the occasional building being burned, though firefighers have adopted some clever tricks to in recent years to minimize this risk. History of Las Fallas
Like most of Spain’s events, the history of Las Fallas is widely disputed, although popular belief suggests that it started in the Middle Ages, when artisans disposed of broken artifacts and the wooden lanterns that lit the streets to celebrate the spring equinox. This also coincided with the church’s festival of Saint Joseph, who was the patron saint of carpenters. From there, smaller characters started being created from the wood, which evolved into the grand statues that are seen today when polystyrene and soft cork made it possible to produce falles over 30 meters tall. The event has become so huge that a significant part of the local economy is devoted to it, and an entire suburban area has taken on the name of City of Falles due to the excessive amount of artisans, sculptors, painters and others who spend months producing the fallas here.

The festivals and celebrations in Spain are full of life. Although Spain is widely known by Flamenco and bullfights, this country has several festivals and celebrations and most towns have their own in addition to the national ones. The majority of festivals in Spain are religious in origin, but, these days, this religious component of every celebration is usually secondary.|
Below you'll see a list with the most impressive festivals or ""fiestas"" in Spain:
Carnival in Spain
During the Carnival celebrations in February there are several impressive festivities in all Spain, specially in Tenerife and Cádiz. In fact, carnival in the Canary Islands and Cádiz are the bests Carnival celebrations in the world, after Rio de Janeiro in Brazil and Trinidad. In those cities, colourful processions are organised and participants wear extravagant costumes. Generally, in many cities of Spain, people dress up and go out, and dance all night long. The Carnival celebrations end on Ash Wednesday with the traditional burial of the Sardine, this event marks the beginning of Lent. Seville April Fair Andalucia
Seville's April Fair (La Feria de Abril) is a huge annual event which takes place in Seville - Andalucía - two weeks after Easter. During this festival you have the opportunity to see the typical flamenco dress, which almost all women wear. Also you will hear the songs of the ""cantaores"" (flamenco singers) and enjoy the movements of the ""bailaoras"" (dancers). San Fermin Running of the Bulls, Pamplona
The festival of San Fermin is by far the best known event taking place in Pamplona. Every year from July 7th-14th thousands pack into Pamplona to start Spain's most famous bull-running fiesta to honour Navarre capital's patron saint, San Fermin. The bull run is the most well known act of the Sanfermines and the reason why so many strangers want to come to Pamplona during these celebrations. The bull running consists of running along certain stretches of the streets which have been previously walled off, and the aim of which is to take six bulls from the Santo Domingo corrals to the Bull Ring. La Tomatina in Buñol, Valencia. Tomato Festival
The ""Tomatina"" is the world's biggest tomato fight and takes place at Bunyol near Valencia. On the last Wednesday of August this charming town erupts into a fiery blaze of tomato-hurling. This fight takes place between 11am and 1pm on that day. Every year around 30,00 people descend on the Spanish town of Bunyol to throw more than 240,000 pounds of tomatoes at each other. Fallas Festival in Valencia
Las Fallas is, without doubt, one of the most unique and crazy festivals in Spain. The Fallas takes place every March in Valencia to celebrate the feast of San José, the patron saint of carpenters. The focus of the fiesta is the creation and destruction of ""ninots"" (huge cardboard statues made of wood and plaster) that are placed at over 350 key intersections and parks around the city. In fact, in all the town you will see these ""ninots"" which will be burned at the last day of the festival -March 19th- in a festival of fire, fireworks and organized mayhem. Festes de la Merce in Barcelona
La Merce, Barcelona's biggest annual festival, takes place on 24th September and lasts for around 3 days. This is a festival held in honour of Mare de Deu de la Merce, the Patron Saint of Barcelona. During this festival, fire-breathing dragons, costumed devils, human pyramids, Sardana dance groups, orchestras, DJs and big-name bands converge on Barcelona. San Isidro in Madrid
San Isidro is the patron saint of the peasants and is also the patron saint of Madrid. Madrid's main annual festival includes nine days of celebrations as well as the start of the capital's bullfighting season. During these days of celebration many cultural events are offered to the people: contests of ""chotis"" (Madrid's traditional dance), concerts of folk music, craftsmanship fairs, etc.

La Tomatina turns sleepy BUNOL red in late August
With a normal population of just 9,000 inhabitants you can just imagine the party atmosphere as 25,000 or more revellers descend on sleepy Bunol for the traditional tomato battle of La Tomatina which is held on the last Wednesday in August each year. One hundred metric tonnes of over-ripe tomatoes are dumped into the streets by Lorry and a massive food fight ensues. The old town streets run red with tomato puree and pulp for a couple of hours then it's all washed away and Bunol is washed cleaned up as though nothing had happened and the tomato battle of La Tomatina had never occurred. Lasting traditionally for only 1 hour La Tomatina is by far the messiest festival you will ever attend and sometimes tomato can still be found days later hiding in the most secretive of body parts (we're talking about ears here of course).

I like food. Eat Your Way Around the World! I wouldn’t classify myself as a ‘foodie,’ because in all honesty, I’m not all that adventurous, nor do I really care what you eat, be it foie gras or spaghetti-o’s, but, if you like food, and like to travel, and like to combine them, then come over and sit by me for a while. The interesting thing about food festivals is that there is one for virtually everything: beer, blueberries, buffalo wings…you eat it, you name it. So, maybe you’re thinking what does this have to do with you, but I think it does, and since my blog is less of a democracy and more enlightened despotism, I’ll tell you why I think this. And it’s for two main reasons. 1 – The obvious, being your tummy will thank you. 2 – The not-so-obvious, by following your passion, you might be able to go to an off the beat place and meet people who have a similar love like you, increasing the possibility of new friends, and starting a new tradition. Everyone has food they love, don’t be ashamed, embrace it, sure I love filet mignon and lobster tails, but things I really love: ketchup, maple syrup, beer, cheese, BBQ and pizza. Maybe you love strawberries, or oysters, or wine, or corn, there are festivals for all. One of the best things about festivals is the personality. Sure there are many on the tame end of things, close down a street, line it with booths, wander around eating, maybe listen to a band, see some fireworks have a beer, very nice, very relaxing and wander back to the old bed and breakfast. Festival success to be sure. If maybe a little more adventure is something you like on your plate, try The World Pea Shooting Championship, in Witcham Village, England (about 35 minutes north of Cambridge), or how about The Battle of the Oranges, in Ivrea, Italy, outside Turin, in the Italian Alps, or even the Charleville Camel, Donkey & Yabbie Festival, smack in the middle of Queensland, Australia. More on the bucket list path, I hear you, then I’d suggest Oktoberfest, in Munich, Germany, I’ve been looking for some buddies to join me in the Hofbrau line. La Tomatina, in Bunyol, Spain, is billed as the world’s largest tomato fight, something I saw for the first time while watching (and this will age me, doh) Road Rules: Europe. If you already have a vacation booked somewhere, search to see if there are any food fests in the area during the time you are there, oftentimes, it’s a great way to see how a culture celebrates, no two festivals are alike! My go to guide for finding all things food, is a fantastic website called Food Reference, sorting can be done by state, month, or country, essential for planning. So get on it, make it a challenge, pick food and go, I guarantee besides being delicious, it will make for a great story.

RULES OF ENGAGEMENT
It has to be said that the Spanish may sound like lawless funsters who disobey all the rules but the reason that La Tomatina and other fiestas in Spain are fun and relatively accident free is that they do, in fact, respect the rules. La Tomatina lasts for exactly one hour from the cannon shot, once the Ham has been won from the 'Soap Pole'. It ends with another cannon shot. The Spanish rarely continue after the cannon. Niether should you. The Organisers tell you to squash tomatoes prior to hurling them, They can really hurt if they hit you, whole, in the face. T-shirts must never be knotted and thrown, a wet t-shirt with a knot in can do serious damage. Ladies, do wear a bather under your t-shirt or top, you will more than likely lose your top during the battle...
Never take valuables or passports into the fray - there is a serious amount of pickpocketing at La Tomatina each year - make sure, if you are on a coach, that they will look after your belongings while you battle. (if you are on a thisisvalencia.com coach - its all part of the service)Or leave your things for a few euros with one of the villagers offering the service on the way into the village. Oh, and bring a change of clothes, and if you are on our thisisvalencia.com tour, bring your swimmers - we swim and chill in a lovely spot after lunch. RULES AND SUGGESTIONS FROM THE ORGANISERS OF LA TOMATINA
These are virtually verbatim from their copy, we've changed a bit of spelling and grammar, but 'tip for enjoyment' number four is classic,
so we left it unchanged. (anything in italics are our notes and additions)
RULES & TIPS FOR ENJOYMENT FROM BUÑOL CITY HALL
The City Hall of Buñol has prepared a list of rules which will ensure that the Tomatina remains a celebration. These simple rules of civic responsibility and cohabitation are important for the festival to develop as usual, without any problem:
· You must not bring bottles or other type of objects which could cause an accident. · You must not break(knot) or throw T-shirts. · The tomatos must be squashed before throwing them, to avoid hurting people. · You must be careful of any lorry. · When you hear the second shot, you must stop throwing tomatos. TIPS FOR ENJOYMENT
Do not wear flip-flops, wear old sports shoes
Do not wear clothes that you want to wear again in the future, it ishighly likely they will be ruined. - don't forget we give you a free tee-shirt, and we'll have extras for sale on the day
Goggles are very practical, because the tomatos cause itchiness in the eyes. (Later, your skin will be very smooth due to the tomatoes.) - - don't forget we give you a free pair of goggles on the day! Enjoy it the most. It is great to be able to do something as nonsense as throwing tomatoes to anyone moving for an hour. You can relieve all your tightness. We should celebrate it more often. If you want to take pictures, you need an underwater waterproof camera. - We always carry a stock of very reasonably priced waterproof disposable cameras on the day - order in advance narer the day
Do not bring a video camera. - unless it is waterproof. Never, and we mean never, climb on a gate, window, wall, etc. to be able to watch the battle, you will became the target of 40,000 people. Don't miss the ‘soap-post’ a pole rubbed in soap with a ham leg hanging at the top. If you can reach the top, the ham leg is yours.","[{'passage': '« Next Article: Carnival in Tenerife\nPrevious Article: Bull runs in Spain »\nWednesday, March 07, 2012 (read 11298 times)\nLa Tomatina Spanish Festivalby Jose\nBuñol is Spanish town famous for a world renowned tomato fight festival known as “La Tomatina”. Valencia, on the east coast of Spain, is a sunny Mediterranean city famous for its long sandy beaches and delicious oranges. Buñol, another city nearby located just 30 miles away in the same province is also very famous for its produce, particularly for its tomatoes. The curious thing, however, is that the small town’s notoriety does not stem from the quality of its tomatoes but rather their interesting custom of “bathing” in it. Buñol is famous around the globe for its “La Tomatina” festival which is essentially the world’s largest tomato fight. The famous tomato throwing battle is held once a year on the last Wednesday of August during the town’s one week festival. The Tomatina festival stared in the 1940s when a group of the town’s residents started a tomato fight in the town square. The tomato battle erupted and soon random pedestrians and other town people were drawn into the battle which culminated in a large food fight. When everything was said and done, the villagers had had such a fun time that they decided to celebrate the tomato fight the next year. From this day forward, the Tomatina festival has been an annual event, growing in size and popularity into the major tourist attraction of national interest that it is today in Spain. The town of Buñol in Valencia celebrates their patron saint for a full week with a variety of events including parades, fireworks, food stands and street parties. Paella cooking contests, wine and food are abundant as the town prepares for its famous tomato fight. As the Tomatina tomato fight approaches, the town’s Medieval bell tower is filled with tomatoes. The tomatoes are specially grown for the festival and are said to not be of food grade quality. When the last Wednesday of August arrives, shopkeepers and other business owners with establishments near the main square cover their windows and doors in preparation for the messy tomato event. The next step in La Tomatina festival is the arrival of the large trucks that slowly make their way up the cobblestone streets of Buñol filled with squishy ripe tomatoes on route to the town square where masses of people are awaiting the official start of the festival. However, before they can enter the main square, someone must overcome the test of the “palo jabón” or greasy pole. The goal is for someone to climb a large greased pole to knock the ham that is hanging on top to the ground. Meanwhile, the crowd below sings, dances and is sprayed with water from hoses. When someone achieves the feat, a fire is shot into the air and the tomato trucks enter the town square. A final shot rings out and the world’s largest tomato battle begins as the trucks offload their tomatoes into the Plaza del Pueblo. The Buñol tomato fight lasts about one hour with about 20,000 participants who generally use approximately 150,000 tomatoes, covering the whole city center and everyone nearby in red tomato sauce. After the event, fire trucks, participants and villagers work to clean the town center with hoses and abundant water. The result is actually a pristine shine to the cobblestone streets which are disinfected and thoroughly cleansed due to the acidity of the tomato sauce. The Buñol Tomatina festival is an event worth witnessing and participating in at least once in your lifetime. However, we recommend that you plan ahead, the small town only offers so much accommodation and the hotels in all the surrounding areas quickly fill up as the event draws near.

The beauty of it all is no one really knows! The old man selling cups of local brew on the street corner will tell you it all began when Don Juan, a Spanish villain and notorious womanizer, was pelted with tomatoes in response to his dreadful singing voice and appalling guitar ability. The little kids trying to make some extra pocket money by looking after your backpack for the night, will swear it was started by a group local rascals raiding a fruit-stand in the town centre and hurling them at each other in a fleeting, moment of madness. And the local women eagerly selling their souvenir T-shirts will say that over 50 years ago a parade, honouring the town’s patron saint Luis Bertràn, ended in carnage when a local produce cart was crushed spilling thousands of ripe tomatoes onto the streets. In true Spanish-fiesta spirit they were promptly picked up and launched at anyone in sight. Whatever legend of La Tomatina you may hear, or choose to believe, nothing comes close to those few breathtaking hours when over 20,000 people ram the streets armed with 250,000 pounds of glorious tomatoes. Forget the term food fight, this is an all-in war! THE FESTIVALOnce a year the sleepy mountain village of Buñol comes alive with thousands of people and truckloads of tomatoes for one of the most amazing spectacles you will ever see! The morning action gets underway when a ham is placed on top of a tall, greased pole in front of the local town hall. The Tomato chaos can only get underway once someone is able to climb the slippery pole and grab the ham. It's hilarious as heaps of people try to scale this pole, climbing over each other, in order to be the illustrious one to claim the ham. Once the ham is snatched the chanting rises to a fever pitch as the trucks roll in and dump masses upon masses of ripe & ready tomatoes in the centre of town, Plaza del Pueblo, and the surrounding streets. The signal for the beginning of the throwing is the firing of five bulbous (tomato-packed rockets) out of a canon and into the air. The crowd erupts into a deafening roar and this launches everyone into a flinging and slinging frenzy. Lock and load because it's on! Forget that Sangria headache from the night before, you are now in the world's largest food fight! This is a salsa riot, this is insane!

Held annually in Bunol (roughly a 30-minute drive from Valencia), this saucy celebration offers participants just one glorious hour of red, pulpy, juicy, squishy and sticky fun. How to paint a town in tomato juice\nAt about 11am on August 27, 2014 (and on the last Wednesday of every August), La Tomatina explodes into Bunol with thousands of sticky visitors and flying tomatoes, and by the end of the frenzied hour, you can hardly tell the people and produce apart. It starts with the tradition where one of the punters has to climb a greasy pole and fetch a ham from the top – as soon as the ham is down, the pulpy carnage can begin. According to urban legend, it all started in the mid-1940s when a group of men wanted to partake in a local parade. Somewhat miffed, they protested by stealing tomatoes from a local stall and using them as weapons. A year later, the same thing happened, yet it wasn’t until the late 50s that the event became official. These days, Bunol’s 9,000 residents are overwhelmed by roughly 30,000 people surging in to the city. Pro tip: Book your accommodation well in advance or expect to stay in Valencia, as Bunol doesn’t have the capacity for such an influx. In fact, the festival used to attract as many as 50,000 people, but since 2013 it has been a ticketed event, capping the numbers to just 20,000 lucky tomato throwers. Tens of thousands of revellers surge through the tiny streets of Bunol, squashing, volleying and dodging approximately 117,934kg (that’s almost 2,000kg a minute!) of overripe tomatoes, according to the Huffington Post. Fire trucks come in afterwards to clean up the pooling mess on the streets, while it’s up to the soggy tomato throwers to clean off best they can either at the Bunol River, or back at their accommodation. Shopkeepers cover their storefronts in an attempt to protect their businesses from the ubiquitous tomato goo, the whole city celebrates for the week with music, parades, dancing and fireworks, and Bunol imports several trucks (or about 100 tonnes) of ripe tomatoes from Extremadura. While it may look like red chaos, there are a handful of rather important rules to keep in mind – as well as some expert advice. 1. You can’t rip shirts\n2. You have to squish the tomatoes prior to throwing them\n3. You can only throw tomatoes\n4. You must stop at the sound of the second cannon\n5. You are strongly – strongly – advised to wear goggles and gloves\n6. Wear closed shoes that you don’t care too much about – thongs will only slip off, and your clothes don’t stand much of a chance of recovering from the battle\n7. Bring waterproof covers for your cameras and phones, and keep keys in plastic bags under your clothes. The less you can bring with you the better, and just make sure you have comprehensive travel insurance in case those pesky tomatoes do find their way into somewhere they shouldn’t be.

As a commemoration of Saint Joseph, hundreds of thousands–perhaps even millions–gather to enjoy fireworks, music, and burn huge paper sculptures. This practice is believed to help people start a fresh new year by burning bad thoughts and memories. Every neighborhood of Valencia has an organized group of people (the Casal faller) who host fundraising dinner parties featuring paella throughout the year, and use the money to construct a massive sculpture (falla) that will eventually be burnt in the festival. The falla is constructed according to an agreed-upon theme, which is typically a satirical shot at anything or anyone who draws the attention of the falleros. Recent editions have included George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Lady Gaga and even Shrek. These are all entered into a contest, and must be completed by March 15th to avoid facing disqualification. From there, they are placed in their respective (albeit temporary) homes during a ceremony called La Planta (the rising), where they remain until being burned. Some of the larger fallas…\nMore grand fallas…\n(image credit: Times of Malta)\n(image credit: Times of Malta)\nThe Main Event(s)\nThe event itself is a 5-day extravaganza, featuring a multitude of historical, religions and comedic processions. Each day begins sharply at 8am with La Despertà or, wake up call, which features brass bands marching down the street playing loud music. Close behind them are the fallers throwing large firecrackers (indeed once you’ve been here, you will no longer be surprised to hear explosions even in the middle of the night, or kids seemingly as small as babies throwing pyrotechnics). Later in the day, at exactly 2pm, comes La Mascletà, an explosive barrage of coordinated firecracker and fireworks displays (the term “las fallas” actually means “the fires” in Valencian, so this shouldn’t come as a surprise). During this, pyrotechnicians are competing for the honor of providing the final Mascletà of the festival on the night of March 19th, also known as La Nit del Foc (“The Night of Fire”). Besides these two regularly scheduled events, the days of Las Fallas are full of a variety of offerings—bullfights, parades, paella contests and even beauty pageants—and stalls everywhere selling fried goodies like pores, xurros, buyols and roasted chestnuts. Each night of the festival features a fireworks display, with each day progressively becoming grander until the main event on the 19th. A typical Mascelta crowd for Las Fallas in Valencia\nOn the final night of Falles, around midnight on March 19, the falles are burnt as huge bonfires. This is known as la cremà (the burning), the climax of the whole event, and the reason why the constructions are called falles (“torches”). Traditionally, the falla in the Plaça de l’Ajuntament is burned last. By this point, the whole city is like a dance party, except that instead of music there is the explosive sound of people throwing fireworks around randomly. This, of course, leads to the occasional building being burned, though firefighers have adopted some clever tricks to in recent years to minimize this risk. History of Las Fallas\nLike most of Spain’s events, the history of Las Fallas is widely disputed, although popular belief suggests that it started in the Middle Ages, when artisans disposed of broken artifacts and the wooden lanterns that lit the streets to celebrate the spring equinox. This also coincided with the church’s festival of Saint Joseph, who was the patron saint of carpenters. From there, smaller characters started being created from the wood, which evolved into the grand statues that are seen today when polystyrene and soft cork made it possible to produce falles over 30 meters tall. The event has become so huge that a significant part of the local economy is devoted to it, and an entire suburban area has taken on the name of City of Falles due to the excessive amount of artisans, sculptors, painters and others who spend months producing the fallas here.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:5a194c82-e65e-4c79-899b-25b33dd188c0>']}, {'passage': 'The festivals and celebrations in Spain are full of life. Although Spain is widely known by Flamenco and bullfights, this country has several festivals and celebrations and most towns have their own in addition to the national ones.

Eat Your Way Around the World! I wouldn’t classify myself as a ‘foodie,’ because in all honesty, I’m not all that adventurous, nor do I really care what you eat, be it foie gras or spaghetti-o’s, but, if you like food, and like to travel, and like to combine them, then come over and sit by me for a while. The interesting thing about food festivals is that there is one for virtually everything: beer, blueberries, buffalo wings…you eat it, you name it. So, maybe you’re thinking what does this have to do with you, but I think it does, and since my blog is less of a democracy and more enlightened despotism, I’ll tell you why I think this. And it’s for two main reasons. 1 – The obvious, being your tummy will thank you. 2 – The not-so-obvious, by following your passion, you might be able to go to an off the beat place and meet people who have a similar love like you, increasing the possibility of new friends, and starting a new tradition. Everyone has food they love, don’t be ashamed, embrace it, sure I love filet mignon and lobster tails, but things I really love: ketchup, maple syrup, beer, cheese, BBQ and pizza. Maybe you love strawberries, or oysters, or wine, or corn, there are festivals for all. One of the best things about festivals is the personality. Sure there are many on the tame end of things, close down a street, line it with booths, wander around eating, maybe listen to a band, see some fireworks have a beer, very nice, very relaxing and wander back to the old bed and breakfast. Festival success to be sure. If maybe a little more adventure is something you like on your plate, try The World Pea Shooting Championship, in Witcham Village, England (about 35 minutes north of Cambridge), or how about The Battle of the Oranges, in Ivrea, Italy, outside Turin, in the Italian Alps, or even the Charleville Camel, Donkey & Yabbie Festival, smack in the middle of Queensland, Australia.

La Tomatina lasts for exactly one hour from the cannon shot, once the Ham has been won from the 'Soap Pole'. It ends with another cannon shot. The Spanish rarely continue after the cannon. Niether should you. The Organisers tell you to squash tomatoes prior to hurling them, They can really hurt if they hit you, whole, in the face. T-shirts must never be knotted and thrown, a wet t-shirt with a knot in can do serious damage. Ladies, do wear a bather under your t-shirt or top, you will more than likely lose your top during the battle...\nNever take valuables or passports into the fray - there is a serious amount of pickpocketing at La Tomatina each year - make sure, if you are on a coach, that they will look after your belongings while you battle. (if you are on a thisisvalencia.com coach - its all part of the service)Or leave your things for a few euros with one of the villagers offering the service on the way into the village. Oh, and bring a change of clothes, and if you are on our thisisvalencia.com tour, bring your swimmers - we swim and chill in a lovely spot after lunch. RULES AND SUGGESTIONS FROM THE ORGANISERS OF LA TOMATINA\nThese are virtually verbatim from their copy, we've changed a bit of spelling and grammar, but 'tip for enjoyment' number four is classic,\nso we left it unchanged. (anything in italics are our notes and additions)\nRULES & TIPS FOR ENJOYMENT FROM BUÑOL CITY HALL\nThe City Hall of Buñol has prepared a list of rules which will ensure that the Tomatina remains a celebration. These simple rules of civic responsibility and cohabitation are important for the festival to develop as usual, without any problem:\n· You must not bring bottles or other type of objects which could cause an accident. · You must not break(knot) or throw T-shirts. · The tomatos must be squashed before throwing them, to avoid hurting people. · You must be careful of any lorry. · When you hear the second shot, you must stop throwing tomatos. TIPS FOR ENJOYMENT\nDo not wear flip-flops, wear old sports shoes\nDo not wear clothes that you want to wear again in the future, it ishighly likely they will be ruined. - don't forget we give you a free tee-shirt, and we'll have extras for sale on the day\nGoggles are very practical, because the tomatos cause itchiness in the eyes. (Later, your skin will be very smooth due to the tomatoes.) - - don't forget we give you a free pair of goggles on the day! Enjoy it the most. It is great to be able to do something as nonsense as throwing tomatoes to anyone moving for an hour. You can relieve all your tightness. We should celebrate it more often. If you want to take pictures, you need an underwater waterproof camera. - We always carry a stock of very reasonably priced waterproof disposable cameras on the day - order in advance narer the day\nDo not bring a video camera. - unless it is waterproof. Never, and we mean never, climb on a gate, window, wall, etc. to be able to watch the battle, you will became the target of 40,000 people. Don't miss the ‘soap-post’ a pole rubbed in soap with a ham leg hanging at the top. If you can reach the top, the ham leg is yours."", 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:82453f3c-1e5f-47ce-998c-79d24aec5097>']}]","{

                ""text"": ""HISTORYThere are plenty of theories on how the legend of La Tomatina came about. The beauty of it all is no one really knows! The old man selling cups of local brew on the street corner will tell you it all began when Don Juan, a Spanish villain and notorious womanizer, was pelted with tomatoes in response to his dreadful singing voice and appalling guitar ability. The little kids trying to make some extra pocket money by looking after your backpack for the night, will swear it was started by a group local rascals raiding a fruit-stand in the town centre and hurling them at each other in a fleeting, moment of madness. And the local women eagerly selling their souvenir T-shirts will say that over 50 years ago a parade, honouring the town\u2019s patron saint Luis Bertr\u00e0n, ended in carnage when a local produce cart was crushed spilling thousands of ripe tomatoes onto the streets. In true Spanish-fiesta spirit they were promptly picked up and launched at anyone in sight. Whatever legend of La Tomatina you may hear, or choose to believe, nothing comes close to those few breathtaking hours when over 20,000 people ram the streets armed with 250,000 pounds of glorious tomatoes. Forget the term food fight, this is an all-in war! THE FESTIVALOnce a year the sleepy mountain village of Bu\u00f1ol comes alive with thousands of people and truckloads of tomatoes for one of the most amazing spectacles you will ever see! The morning action gets underway when a ham is placed on top of a tall, greased pole in front of the local town hall. The Tomato chaos can only get underway once someone is able to climb the slippery pole and grab the ham. It's hilarious as heaps of people try to scale this pole, climbing over each other, in order to be the illustrious one to claim the ham. Once the ham is snatched the chanting rises to a fever pitch as the trucks roll in and dump masses upon masses of ripe & ready tomatoes in the centre of town, Plaza del Pueblo, and the surrounding streets. The signal for the beginning of the throwing is the firing of five bulbous (tomato-packed rockets) out of a canon and into the air. The crowd erupts into a deafening roar and this launches everyone into a flinging and slinging frenzy. Lock and load because it's on! Forget that Sangria headache from the night before, you are now in the world's largest food fight! This is a salsa riot, this is insane! FANATICS @ LA TOMATINAFanatics first attended La Tomatina when swanning around southern Spain a decade ago and have been going back ever since.

Discovering the role that 4th and 5th-grade friendships have to play in children’s STEM interest
Most parents understand that their child’s friendships hold great influence on their perceptions, hobbies, and interests – but today, our Data Scientist, David Meier, provides us with some interesting evidence that demonstrates how your children’s friends feel about STEM may greatly impact your own child’s STEM interest!
Interesting results emerged when we analyzed data from our Camp Invention Research Project: Institute for Learning Innovation study regarding what STEM areas girls and boys enjoy learning about. Using a five-point rating scale with five being the highest, we asked 485 fourth and fifth-grade Camp Invention participants how much they liked finding out about or learning about various STEM topics. These topics were selected to measure interest in three main STEM areas: Life Science, Earth Science, and Technology and Engineering.
Utilizing T-Tests, we found that the 209 girls liked finding out about Life Science more than the 276 boys (average rating of 3.69 to 3.37) and that the boys liked finding out about Technology and Engineering more than the girls (average rating of 4.18 to 3.98).
While this finding may not be overly surprising to some people, what we found particularly interesting is that no statistically significant difference was found between the reported liking of finding out about Earth Science between the girls and the boys (average rating of 4.15 and 4.00).
We also asked the participants to rate their agreement to the question, “My friends think science and engineering are cool.”
Utilizing regression models, we found there to be a statistically significant and positive relationship between a participant’s friends thinking science and engineering are cool and their own enjoyment in finding out about all three of the STEM areas!
Interestingly, while no difference in the average rating for liking learning about Earth Science was found between the girls and the boys, the relationship between girls’ friends thinking science and engineering is cool and their rating of liking finding out about Earth Science was stronger than for the boys.
Indeed, for the girls, we found that for every one-unit increase in the rating of their friends’ thinking science and engineering is cool we could predict a corresponding increase of .21 units in their own rating of liking finding out about Earth Science (the predicted increase for the boys was .19 units).
While the statistical tests we utilized don’t prove causation, their statistically significant and predictive quality provides us evidence that there definitely is a positive relationship between friends’ attitudes towards science and engineering and a child’s own enjoyment in finding out about Life Science, Earth Science, and Technology and Engineering.
Parents, have you found this to be displayed in your own children’s friendships?

Current science education reforms emphasize the ways in which students’ scientific practices, such as experimenting, collecting data, and interpreting results, develop over time. Bricker and Bell suggest that practices develop not only over time, but also across multiple settings and opportunities. Their study shows how, over several years, one youth’s identification with science was shaped by many everyday moments, social configurations, and collaborators. Maltese, A., Melki, C., & Weibke, H. (2014). The nature of experiences responsible for the generation and maintenance of interest in STEM. Science Education, 98(6), 937–962. doi:10.1002/sce.21132
Researchers Maltese, Melki, and Wiebke investigated when lasting interest in STEM is sparked and how it is maintained by comparing the remembrances of adults who did and did not persist in STEM. Both groups said that they became interested in STEM early, usually by Grade 6. Those who persisted in STEM were more likely than those who did not to say that they had always been interested in STEM. Parents and teachers were early influences for those who stayed in STEM fields. Van Schijndel, T. J. P., Franse, R. K., & Raijmakers, M. E. J. (2010). The Exploratory Behavior Scale: Assessing young visitors’ hands-on behavior in science museums. Science Education, 94, 794–809. The authors of this paper were interested in knowing how parents can support exploratory behaviors of their preschool-aged children at museum exhibits. They developed a quantitative instrument based on psychological literature on exploration and play in order to describe and quantify young children's increasing levels of exploration of their environment. They then tested the measurement tool with parents and their preschool-aged children to investigate what types of adult coaching would achieve high-level exploratory behavior at various exhibits.

The field of informal science education has embraced “making” and design activities as a powerful approach to engaging learners. This chapter by Blikstein finds that in order to create disruptive spaces where students can learn STEM, design and build inventive projects, educators . This paper provides theoretical background and concrete cases that illuminate program design and implementation issues related to making. Alexander, J. M., Johnson, K. E., & Kelley, K. (2012). Longitudinal analysis of the relations between opportunities to learn about science and the development of interests related to science. Science Education, 96(5), 763–786. doi:10.1002/sce.21018
This study considers the relationship between preschoolers’ early exposure to informal science experiences and their interest in science, with particular attention paid to gender differences. A longitudinal study of children ages 4 to 7 found that early science interest was a strong predictor of later parent-provided opportunities to engage in science learning. Briseño-Garzón, A. (2013).

Briseño-Garzón analyzed interviews with 20 families after they visited Universum Museo de las Ciencias. She concluded that the benefits of visiting a science museum are “much more than science,” including spending quality time together as a family, interacting with others, learning about local culture and history, learning from each other, and, of course, learning science.

How do I know if it is working for my youth? As we talked about last month, the Internet is chock-full of sites claiming that their activities will turn your young people into scientists and engineers. We know however that all STEM activities are not created equal and it can be challenging to find the right fit for your club or program. Execution, or how you facilitate the STEM activities, is also really important. We will talk about that in future posts! Look for activities that focus on real world things that your young people will be interested in and will spark their curiosity. It is also helpful if the activity has multiple creative solutions and not just one right answer. Here on campus we run a program called Teen Science Café where high school students work with one of our Rutgers scientists or engineers to learn about current research on a STEM topic of their interest. The teens invited an engineer, Dr. Benaroya, to explore the idea of moving to another planet? Dr. Benaroya completely engaged the teens in engineering and design thinking with just a sheet of paper, a pencil, and their collaborative brains. The teens spent over an hour engineering creative space elevators to the moon. This problem was real-world and definitely sparked their interest! There were as many designs as there were groups of teens working collaboratively on the solution. At the end of the day, the activity should provide several opportunities for the youth to experience what scientists and engineers really do:
- Asking scientific questions
- Designing investigations or solving problems
- Using math
- Constructing explanations
- Analyzing information
- Using models to explain phenomena
- Engaging in argument from evidence
- Communicating information
Make it cool to want to do these things… especially for your young girls in your club or program. Making your activities gender friendly for both boys and girls is very important. I encourage you to check out the Click2science STEM Activity Quality Checklist to see how your activity measures up. As club or program leaders we often can sense when things are going right and when they are not. It might be helpful to think about these questions as you design your STEM activity:
- What will success for your activity look like? - Where were you at the outset of this activity? What do the kids already know about this topic? (establish a baseline so you can measure progress)
- How will you know that you have been successful? What evidence will you rely upon and hence need to collect to make a judgment on its success? Thoughtful consideration of these ideas can make a club meeting or afterschool program more meaningful to your young people and engage them in true STEM learning. Next month we will talk about how to engage young people in meaningful STEM conversations. By: Janice McDonnell, Science Agent, Rutgers Cooperative Extension

A range of analysis techniques which can examine quantitative data in more depth than can usually be obtained from a basic cross-analysis of the data by, for example, age, sex and social grade. The essence of this range of approaches is that the information is analysed in a way that permits patterns to emerge from within the data itself - ie based on the responses of the informants - rather than being imposed in advance, perhaps incorrectly or simplistically, by the researcher. The study of two or more effects (“dependent variables”) at one time. – A measure of how many people or things in a group were studied by the researcher; followed by an equal sign and a numeral. This refers to analysis of a sample (in this context, a protein) by more than one independent method of analysis. For example, a classical 2-D gel provides two independent, orthogonal parameters, pI and apparent size. MALDI of the intact protein from the gel provides a third dimension, mass, which is an intrinsic property of the protein and is similar, but more useful, than the relative size derived from the SDS dimension. MALDI of the CNBr fragments of the protein directly from the gel provides a true fourth dimension of analysis. analysis of the relationships between three or more variables (as opposed to bivariate analysis, which involves two variables, or univariate analysis which involves one). A statistical analysis technique in which multiple variables are analyzed separately to determine the contribution made by each variable to an observed result. Contrast with univariate analysis. a statistical term refering to analyses that involve a number of different variables. For example, an analysis that looked at whether peer factors and individual factors both influence alcohol use would be called ""multivariate"". A range of techniques that permit the analysis of several variables simultaneously. Most often refers to statistical tests that examine more than two variables at the same time. a generic term for any statistical technique used to analyze data from more than one variable
Any of several methods for examining multiple variables at the same time. Usage varies. (a) Stricter usage reserves the term for designs with two or more independent variables and two or more dependent variables. (b) More loosely, multivariate analysis applies to designs with more than one independent variable or more than one dependent variable or both. Whichever usage you prefer, either allows researchers to examine the relation between two variables while simultaneously controlling for the influence of other variables. Examples include path analysis, factor analysis, multiple regression analysis, MANOVA, LISREL, canonical correlations, and discriminant analysis. A set of statistical techniques for analyzing the individual and joint effects of a number of factors on the outcomes of the process or disease being studied. Multivariate analysis is a statistical technique that entails the analysis of the relationships between more than two variables. Carrying out multivariate analysis in this research means we could isolate the effect of design on business performance from other factors. See the Detailed research methodology for more information. Product and industrial design This design service covers design of any consumer /household products, furniture and industrial design such as automotive, engineering and medical products. R&D tax credits for SMEs Research and development (R&D) tax credits are a form of company tax relief which can either reduce a companyâ€(tm)s tax bill or, for some small or medium-sized companies, provide a cash sum. The aim of the tax credits is to encourage greater R&D spending in order to promote investment in innovation. See the HM Customs and Revenue website for more details. the simultaneous study of two or more measures, often involving a relationship with a dependent (outcome) measure. Analysis utilising more than one variable in combination, for example maintaining the wind and pressure fields in balance (Section 8.2.3). The analysis of more than two variables simultaneously, for the purpose of determining the relationship among them. a statistical analysis that involves more than one dependent variable. analysis involving multiple independent or dependent variables. The analysis of relationships between several variables â€“ e.g. factor analysis. is performed when datasets are composed of vector observations. These can consist of observations of different variables at one location or gridpoint values for a particular time sequence. Different multivariate data analysis techniques are used in climate research (see CCA, EOF, SVD, PCA, etc.).

A general knowledge test appropriate for adults was created using materials from a previous study see supplementary materials. The test consisted of 20 multiple choice questions with medium difficulty. Describe any covariates—these are any additional variables that may explain or predict the outcomes. This tells the reader how similarly each response was rated by multiple raters. Report all of the procedures applied for administering the study, processing the data, and for planned data analyses. Data collection methods refers to the general mode of the instruments: surveys, interviews, observations, focus groups, neuroimaging, cognitive tests, and so on. Summarize exactly how you collected the necessary data. Describe all procedures you applied in administering surveys, tests, physical recordings, or imaging devices, with enough detail so that someone else can replicate your techniques. If your procedures are very complicated and require long descriptions e.
To report research design, note your overall framework for data collection and analysis. Also note whether a between-subjects or a within-subjects design was used. Describe whether any masking was used to hide the condition assignment e. Using masking in a multi-group study ensures internal validity by reducing bias. Explain how this masking was applied and whether its effectiveness was assessed. Participants were randomly assigned to a control or experimental condition. To begin, all participants were given the AAI and a demographics questionnaire to complete, followed by an unrelated filler task. In the control condition , participants completed a short general knowledge test immediately after the filler task. In the experimental condition, participants were asked to visualize themselves taking the test for 3 minutes before they actually did. For more details on the exact instructions and tasks given, see supplementary materials. In the between-subjects experimental design, the independent variable was whether the visualization intervention was applied and the dependent variable was the difference in test scores between conditions. Data diagnostics Outline all steps taken to scrutinize or process the data after collection. To ensure high validity, you should provide enough detail for your reader to understand how and why you processed or transformed your raw data in these specific ways. The methods section is also where you describe your statistical analysis procedures, but not their outcomes. Their outcomes are reported in the results section. These procedures should be stated for all primary, secondary, and exploratory hypotheses. This annotated example reports methods for a descriptive correlational survey on the relationship between religiosity and trust in science in the US. Hover over each part for explanation of what is included. Example of an APA methods section Methods. The sample included adults aged between 18 and Ethics approval was obtained from the university board before recruitment began. We selected for a geographically diverse sample within the Midwest of the US through an initial screening survey. The primary outcome measures were the levels of religiosity and trust in science. Religiosity refers to involvement and belief in religious traditions, while trust in science represents confidence in scientists and scientific research outcomes. The secondary outcome measures were gender and parental education levels of participants and whether these characteristics predicted religiosity levels. Religiosity was measured using the Centrality of Religiosity scale Huber, The Likert scale is made up of 15 questions with five subscales of ideology, experience, intellect, public practice, and private practice. The internal consistency of the instrument is. Trust in Science. Four Likert scale items were assessed on a scale from 1 completely distrust to 5 completely trust. Potential participants were invited to participate in the survey online using Qualtrics www. The survey consisted of multiple choice questions regarding demographic characteristics, the Centrality of Religiosity scale, an unrelated filler anagram task, and finally the General Trust in Science index. The filler task was included to avoid priming or demand characteristics, and an attention check was embedded within the religiosity scale. For full instructions and details of tasks, see supplementary materials. For this correlational study , we assessed our primary hypothesis of a relationship between religiosity and trust in science using Pearson moment correlation coefficient. The statistical significance of the correlation coefficient was assessed using a t test. To test our secondary hypothesis of parental education levels and gender as predictors of religiosity, multiple linear regression analysis was used. In your APA methods section , you should report detailed information on the participants, materials, and procedures used.

Different methods are used to tackle these combinations during analysis process. Let’s understand the possible combinations in detail:
Continuous & Continuous: While doing bi-variate analysis between two continuous variables, we should look at scatter plot. It is a nifty way to find out the relationship between two variables. The pattern of scatter plot indicates the relationship between variables. The relationship can be linear or non-linear. Scatter plot shows the relationship between two variable but does not indicates the strength of relationship amongst them. To find the strength of the relationship, we use Correlation. Correlation varies between -1 and +1. - -1: perfect negative linear correlation
- +1:perfect positive linear correlation and
- 0: No correlation
Correlation can be derived using following formula:
Correlation = Covariance(X,Y) / SQRT( Var(X)* Var(Y))
Various tools have function or functionality to identify correlation between variables. In Excel, function CORREL() is used to return the correlation between two variables and SAS uses procedure PROC CORR to identify the correlation. These function returns Pearson Correlation value to identify the relationship between two variables:
In above example, we have good positive relationship(0.65) between two variables X and Y.
Categorical & Categorical: To find the relationship between two categorical variables, we can use following methods:
- Two-way table: We can start analyzing the relationship by creating a two-way table of count and count%. The rows represents the category of one variable and the columns represent the categories of the other variable. We show count or count% of observations available in each combination of row and column categories. - Stacked Column Chart: This method is more of a visual form of Two-way table. - Chi-Square Test: This test is used to derive the statistical significance of relationship between the variables. Also, it tests whether the evidence in the sample is strong enough to generalize that the relationship for a larger population as well. Chi-square is based on the difference between the expected and observed frequencies in one or more categories in the two-way table. It returns probability for the computed chi-square distribution with the degree of freedom. Probability of 0: It indicates that both categorical variable are dependent
Probability of 1: It shows that both variables are independent. Probability less than 0.05: It indicates that the relationship between the variables is significant at 95% confidence. The chi-square test statistic for a test of independence of two categorical variables is found by:
where O represents the observed frequency. E is the expected frequency under the null hypothesis and computed by:
From previous two-way table, the expected count for product category 1 to be of small size is 0.22. It is derived by taking the row total for Size (9) times the column total for Product category (2) then dividing by the sample size (81). This is procedure is conducted for each cell. Statistical Measures used to analyze the power of relationship are:
- Cramer’s V for Nominal Categorical Variable
- Mantel-Haenszed Chi-Square for ordinal categorical variable. Different data science language and tools have specific methods to perform chi-square test. In SAS, we can use Chisq as an option with Proc freq to perform this test. Categorical & Continuous: While exploring relation between categorical and continuous variables, we can draw box plots for each level of categorical variables. If levels are small in number, it will not show the statistical significance. To look at the statistical significance we can perform Z-test, T-test or ANOVA. - Z-Test/ T-Test:- Either test assess whether mean of two groups are statistically different from each other or not.If the probability of Z is small then the difference of two averages is more significant. The T-test is very similar to Z-test but it is used when number of observation for both categories is less than 30. - ANOVA:- It assesses whether the average of more than two groups is statistically different. Example: Suppose, we want to test the effect of five different exercises. For this, we recruit 20 men and assign one type of exercise to 4 men (5 groups). Their weights are recorded after a few weeks. We need to find out whether the effect of these exercises on them is significantly different or not.

References to specific technologies were replaced with just “technology”. Unsuccessful adaptations, or items that were now too similar, were again removed, resulting in 51 items being used for a pilot study. These covered expected aspects of usefulness, enjoyment, ease, confidence, interest, support, and importance. The items included positive and reversed items in order to combat acquiescence bias (Oppenheim, 1998). A small pilot survey (n = 24) was conducted to validate the instrument. It used students from the participant pool expected for the main study, and got a good spread of participants from the target groups (different ages, disciplines, etc). The questionnaire was trialled, and participants interviewed to determine if any questions were unclear, and if they felt anything was missing from the survey. The pilot data was initially checked for errors (e.g. due to duplicate questions). A correlation matrix was checked for items that were highly correlated (> 0.8) with other items (Field, 2005). Where this was found, it was always due to items asking about similar concepts; in all cases, the more clearly-worded item was kept and the other item removed (Oppenheim, 1998). From this, 37 items remained. A principal components analysis (PCA) was run. In order to do this, Horn’s parallel analysis was used to determine how many factors to extract (Horn, 1965). Parallel analysis is considered to be the most accurate method of factor extraction since it outperforms the K1 rule and scree plots (Ledesma & Valero-Mora, 2007; Matsunaga, 2010; O’Connor, 2000; Zwick & Velicer, 1986). Two factors were identified from the parallel analysis. The PCA showed two items loaded onto both factors with a difference of less than 0.4 between the primary and secondary loadings, so these were discarded (Matsunaga, 2010). The first factor contained items about attitudes about technology utility, and the second factor contained items about comfort and confidence when using technology. Internal consistency of the whole attitudes section was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, and was found to be 0.935. The coefficient is sufficiently high, above the minimum recommendation of 0.7 (Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994). It is common for tests with higher numbers of items to result in higher levels of alpha (Tavakol & Dennick, 2011), so the relatively high number of items in this test may explain why alpha is so high. After piloting and validation, 35 items were accepted for use in the final instrument for the main study, which will now be discussed. Technology attitude questionnaire
The new instrument is called the Technology Attitude Questionnaire (TAQ), and adapts its 35 attitude items from Al-Emran et al. (2016), Bonanno, and Kommers, P.a.M. (2008), , Edmunds et al. (2012), Jay and Willis (1992), Garland and Noyes (2005), Knezek, Christensen, and Miyashita (1998), Lee and Clarke (2015), Liaw, Huang, and Chen (2007), Nguyen, Hseih, and Allen (2006), Pierce, Stacey, and Barkatsas (2007), Saadé and Kira (2007), Sagin Simsek (2008), Teo (2008), and Teo, Lee, and Chai (2008). In addition to this attitudes section, questions about how students use technology were also included. The TAQ was administered online using Survey Monkey. A copy of the final TAQ is included in the supplementary materials. The TAQ is divided into three sections. The first section gives students a list of 24 types of technology, both hardware (e.g., laptops, mobile telephones, televisions, e-readers) and software (e.g., social networking, office suites, online forums, videos), and explores which of these they have used for course activities, non-course activities, or both. The second section asks how often they use each of the technologies (daily, weekly, monthly, less often than monthly, never, adapted from Kennedy et al. (2010)), and how long they have been using them (less than a year, 1–2 years, 3–5 years, 6–10 years, more than 10 years, never). These first two sections satisfy the behavioural component of attitude, as they describe how the student uses technology (Di Martino & Zan, 2010). The third section explores students’ attitudes to technology and attempts to find underlying factors.

Statistics is a mathematical science pertaining to the collection, analysis, interpretation or explanation, and presentation of data. It is applicable to a wide variety of academic disciplines, from the natural and social sciences to the humanities, and to government and business. Statistical methods can be used to summarize or describe a collection of data; this is called descriptive statistics. In addition, patterns in the data may be modeled in a way that accounts for randomness and uncertainty in the observations, and then used to draw inferences about the process or population being studied; this is called inferential statistics. Both descriptive and inferential statistics comprise applied statistics. There is also a discipline called mathematical statistics, which is concerned with the theoretical basis of the subject. The word statistics is also the plural of statistic (singular), which refers to the result of applying a statistical algorithm to a set of data, as in economic statistics, crime statistics, etc. Statistics arose, no later than the 18th century, from the need of states to collect data on their people and economies, in order to administer them. Its meaning broadened in the early 19th century to include the collection and analysis of data in general. Today statistics is widely employed in government, business, and the natural and social sciences. Because of its origins in government and its data-centric world view, statistics is considered to be not a subfield of mathematics but rather a distinct field that uses mathematics. Its mathematical foundations were laid in the 17th and 18th centuries with the development of probability theory. The method of least squares, a central technique of the discipline, was invented in the early 19th century by several authors. Since then new techniques of probability and statistics have been in continual development. Modern computers have expedited large-scale statistical computation, and have also made possible new methods that would be impractical to perform manually. In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or societal problem, one begins with a process or population to be studied. This might be a population of people in a country, of crystal grains in a rock, or of goods manufactured by a particular factory during a given period. It may instead be a process observed at various times; data collected about this kind of ""population"" constitute what is called a time series. For practical reasons, rather than compiling data about an entire population, one usually studies a chosen subset of the population, called a sample. Data are collected about the sample in an observational or experimental setting. The data are then subjected to statistical analysis, which serves two related purposes: description and inference. - Descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the data, either numerically or graphically, to describe the sample. Basic examples of numerical descriptors include the mean and standard deviation. Graphical summarizations include various kinds of charts and graphs. - Inferential statistics is used to model patterns in the data, accounting for randomness and drawing inferences about the larger population. These inferences may take the form of answers to yes/no questions ( hypothesis testing), estimates of numerical characteristics ( estimation), descriptions of association (correlation), or modeling of relationships (regression). Other modeling techniques include ANOVA, time series, and data mining. |“… it is only the manipulation of uncertainty that interests us. We are not concerned with the matter that is uncertain. Thus we do not study the mechanism of rain; only whether it will rain.”
Dennis Lindley, ""The Philosophy of Statistics"", The Statistician (2000). The concept of correlation is particularly noteworthy. Statistical analysis of a data set may reveal that two variables (that is, two properties of the population under consideration) tend to vary together, as if they are connected. For example, a study of annual income and age of death among people might find that poor people tend to have shorter lives than affluent people. The two variables are said to be correlated. However, one cannot immediately infer the existence of a causal relationship between the two variables (see Correlation does not imply causation). The correlated phenomena could be caused by a third, previously unconsidered phenomenon, called a lurking variable.","[{'passage': 'Stem Friends: Friendships and STEM interest\nDiscovering the role that 4th and 5th-grade friendships have to play in children’s STEM interest\nMost parents understand that their child’s friendships hold great influence on their perceptions, hobbies, and interests – but today, our Data Scientist, David Meier, provides us with some interesting evidence that demonstrates how your children’s friends feel about STEM may greatly impact your own child’s STEM interest! Interesting results emerged when we analyzed data from our Camp Invention Research Project: Institute for Learning Innovation study regarding what STEM areas girls and boys enjoy learning about. Using a five-point rating scale with five being the highest, we asked 485 fourth and fifth-grade Camp Invention participants how much they liked finding out about or learning about various STEM topics. These topics were selected to measure interest in three main STEM areas: Life Science, Earth Science, and Technology and Engineering. Utilizing T-Tests, we found that the 209 girls liked finding out about Life Science more than the 276 boys (average rating of 3.69 to 3.37) and that the boys liked finding out about Technology and Engineering more than the girls (average rating of 4.18 to 3.98). While this finding may not be overly surprising to some people, what we found particularly interesting is that no statistically significant difference was found between the reported liking of finding out about Earth Science between the girls and the boys (average rating of 4.15 and 4.00). We also asked the participants to rate their agreement to the question, “My friends think science and engineering are cool.”\nUtilizing regression models, we found there to be a statistically significant and positive relationship between a participant’s friends thinking science and engineering are cool and their own enjoyment in finding out about all three of the STEM areas! Interestingly, while no difference in the average rating for liking learning about Earth Science was found between the girls and the boys, the relationship between girls’ friends thinking science and engineering is cool and their rating of liking finding out about Earth Science was stronger than for the boys. Indeed, for the girls, we found that for every one-unit increase in the rating of their friends’ thinking science and engineering is cool we could predict a corresponding increase of .21 units in their own rating of liking finding out about Earth Science (the predicted increase for the boys was .19 units). While the statistical tests we utilized don’t prove causation, their statistically significant and predictive quality provides us evidence that there definitely is a positive relationship between friends’ attitudes towards science and engineering and a child’s own enjoyment in finding out about Life Science, Earth Science, and Technology and Engineering. Parents, have you found this to be displayed in your own children’s friendships? For more information on these findings, feel free to contact Data Scientist, David Meier.

Parents and teachers were early influences for those who stayed in STEM fields. Van Schijndel, T. J. P., Franse, R. K., & Raijmakers, M. E. J. (2010).

They developed a quantitative instrument based on psychological literature on exploration and play in order to describe and quantify young children's increasing levels of exploration of their environment. They then tested the measurement tool with parents and their preschool-aged children to investigate what types of adult coaching would achieve high-level exploratory behavior at various exhibits.

As we talked about last month, the Internet is chock-full of sites claiming that their activities will turn your young people into scientists and engineers. We know however that all STEM activities are not created equal and it can be challenging to find the right fit for your club or program. Execution, or how you facilitate the STEM activities, is also really important. We will talk about that in future posts! Look for activities that focus on real world things that your young people will be interested in and will spark their curiosity. It is also helpful if the activity has multiple creative solutions and not just one right answer. Here on campus we run a program called Teen Science Café where high school students work with one of our Rutgers scientists or engineers to learn about current research on a STEM topic of their interest. The teens invited an engineer, Dr. Benaroya, to explore the idea of moving to another planet? Dr. Benaroya completely engaged the teens in engineering and design thinking with just a sheet of paper, a pencil, and their collaborative brains. The teens spent over an hour engineering creative space elevators to the moon. This problem was real-world and definitely sparked their interest! There were as many designs as there were groups of teens working collaboratively on the solution. At the end of the day, the activity should provide several opportunities for the youth to experience what scientists and engineers really do:\n- Asking scientific questions\n- Designing investigations or solving problems\n- Using math\n- Constructing explanations\n- Analyzing information\n- Using models to explain phenomena\n- Engaging in argument from evidence\n- Communicating information\nMake it cool to want to do these things… especially for your young girls in your club or program. Making your activities gender friendly for both boys and girls is very important. I encourage you to check out the Click2science STEM Activity Quality Checklist to see how your activity measures up. As club or program leaders we often can sense when things are going right and when they are not. It might be helpful to think about these questions as you design your STEM activity:\n- What will success for your activity look like? - Where were you at the outset of this activity? What do the kids already know about this topic? (establish a baseline so you can measure progress)\n- How will you know that you have been successful? What evidence will you rely upon and hence need to collect to make a judgment on its success? Thoughtful consideration of these ideas can make a club meeting or afterschool program more meaningful to your young people and engage them in true STEM learning. Next month we will talk about how to engage young people in meaningful STEM conversations.

The essence of this range of approaches is that the information is analysed in a way that permits patterns to emerge from within the data itself - ie based on the responses of the informants - rather than being imposed in advance, perhaps incorrectly or simplistically, by the researcher. The study of two or more effects (“dependent variables”) at one time. – A measure of how many people or things in a group were studied by the researcher; followed by an equal sign and a numeral. This refers to analysis of a sample (in this context, a protein) by more than one independent method of analysis. For example, a classical 2-D gel provides two independent, orthogonal parameters, pI and apparent size. MALDI of the intact protein from the gel provides a third dimension, mass, which is an intrinsic property of the protein and is similar, but more useful, than the relative size derived from the SDS dimension. MALDI of the CNBr fragments of the protein directly from the gel provides a true fourth dimension of analysis. analysis of the relationships between three or more variables (as opposed to bivariate analysis, which involves two variables, or univariate analysis which involves one). A statistical analysis technique in which multiple variables are analyzed separately to determine the contribution made by each variable to an observed result. Contrast with univariate analysis. a statistical term refering to analyses that involve a number of different variables. For example, an analysis that looked at whether peer factors and individual factors both influence alcohol use would be called ""multivariate"". A range of techniques that permit the analysis of several variables simultaneously. Most often refers to statistical tests that examine more than two variables at the same time. a generic term for any statistical technique used to analyze data from more than one variable\nAny of several methods for examining multiple variables at the same time. Usage varies. (a) Stricter usage reserves the term for designs with two or more independent variables and two or more dependent variables. (b) More loosely, multivariate analysis applies to designs with more than one independent variable or more than one dependent variable or both. Whichever usage you prefer, either allows researchers to examine the relation between two variables while simultaneously controlling for the influence of other variables. Examples include path analysis, factor analysis, multiple regression analysis, MANOVA, LISREL, canonical correlations, and discriminant analysis. A set of statistical techniques for analyzing the individual and joint effects of a number of factors on the outcomes of the process or disease being studied. Multivariate analysis is a statistical technique that entails the analysis of the relationships between more than two variables. Carrying out multivariate analysis in this research means we could isolate the effect of design on business performance from other factors. See the Detailed research methodology for more information.

R&D tax credits for SMEs Research and development (R&D) tax credits are a form of company tax relief which can either reduce a companyâ€(tm)s tax bill or, for some small or medium-sized companies, provide a cash sum. The aim of the tax credits is to encourage greater R&D spending in order to promote investment in innovation. See the HM Customs and Revenue website for more details. the simultaneous study of two or more measures, often involving a relationship with a dependent (outcome) measure. Analysis utilising more than one variable in combination, for example maintaining the wind and pressure fields in balance (Section 8.2.3). The analysis of more than two variables simultaneously, for the purpose of determining the relationship among them. a statistical analysis that involves more than one dependent variable. analysis involving multiple independent or dependent variables. The analysis of relationships between several variables â€“ e.g. factor analysis. is performed when datasets are composed of vector observations.

The sample included adults aged between 18 and Ethics approval was obtained from the university board before recruitment began. We selected for a geographically diverse sample within the Midwest of the US through an initial screening survey. The primary outcome measures were the levels of religiosity and trust in science. Religiosity refers to involvement and belief in religious traditions, while trust in science represents confidence in scientists and scientific research outcomes. The secondary outcome measures were gender and parental education levels of participants and whether these characteristics predicted religiosity levels. Religiosity was measured using the Centrality of Religiosity scale Huber, The Likert scale is made up of 15 questions with five subscales of ideology, experience, intellect, public practice, and private practice. The internal consistency of the instrument is. Trust in Science. Four Likert scale items were assessed on a scale from 1 completely distrust to 5 completely trust. Potential participants were invited to participate in the survey online using Qualtrics www. The survey consisted of multiple choice questions regarding demographic characteristics, the Centrality of Religiosity scale, an unrelated filler anagram task, and finally the General Trust in Science index. The filler task was included to avoid priming or demand characteristics, and an attention check was embedded within the religiosity scale. For full instructions and details of tasks, see supplementary materials. For this correlational study , we assessed our primary hypothesis of a relationship between religiosity and trust in science using Pearson moment correlation coefficient.

Let’s understand the possible combinations in detail:\nContinuous & Continuous: While doing bi-variate analysis between two continuous variables, we should look at scatter plot. It is a nifty way to find out the relationship between two variables. The pattern of scatter plot indicates the relationship between variables. The relationship can be linear or non-linear. Scatter plot shows the relationship between two variable but does not indicates the strength of relationship amongst them. To find the strength of the relationship, we use Correlation. Correlation varies between -1 and +1. - -1: perfect negative linear correlation\n- +1:perfect positive linear correlation and\n- 0: No correlation\nCorrelation can be derived using following formula:\nCorrelation = Covariance(X,Y) / SQRT( Var(X)* Var(Y))\nVarious tools have function or functionality to identify correlation between variables. In Excel, function CORREL() is used to return the correlation between two variables and SAS uses procedure PROC CORR to identify the correlation. These function returns Pearson Correlation value to identify the relationship between two variables:\nIn above example, we have good positive relationship(0.65) between two variables X and Y.\nCategorical & Categorical: To find the relationship between two categorical variables, we can use following methods:\n- Two-way table: We can start analyzing the relationship by creating a two-way table of count and count%. The rows represents the category of one variable and the columns represent the categories of the other variable. We show count or count% of observations available in each combination of row and column categories. - Stacked Column Chart: This method is more of a visual form of Two-way table. - Chi-Square Test: This test is used to derive the statistical significance of relationship between the variables. Also, it tests whether the evidence in the sample is strong enough to generalize that the relationship for a larger population as well. Chi-square is based on the difference between the expected and observed frequencies in one or more categories in the two-way table. It returns probability for the computed chi-square distribution with the degree of freedom. Probability of 0: It indicates that both categorical variable are dependent\nProbability of 1: It shows that both variables are independent. Probability less than 0.05: It indicates that the relationship between the variables is significant at 95% confidence. The chi-square test statistic for a test of independence of two categorical variables is found by:\nwhere O represents the observed frequency. E is the expected frequency under the null hypothesis and computed by:\nFrom previous two-way table, the expected count for product category 1 to be of small size is 0.22. It is derived by taking the row total for Size (9) times the column total for Product category (2) then dividing by the sample size (81). This is procedure is conducted for each cell. Statistical Measures used to analyze the power of relationship are:\n- Cramer’s V for Nominal Categorical Variable\n- Mantel-Haenszed Chi-Square for ordinal categorical variable. Different data science language and tools have specific methods to perform chi-square test. In SAS, we can use Chisq as an option with Proc freq to perform this test. Categorical & Continuous: While exploring relation between categorical and continuous variables, we can draw box plots for each level of categorical variables. If levels are small in number, it will not show the statistical significance. To look at the statistical significance we can perform Z-test, T-test or ANOVA. - Z-Test/ T-Test:- Either test assess whether mean of two groups are statistically different from each other or not.If the probability of Z is small then the difference of two averages is more significant. The T-test is very similar to Z-test but it is used when number of observation for both categories is less than 30. - ANOVA:- It assesses whether the average of more than two groups is statistically different. Example: Suppose, we want to test the effect of five different exercises. For this, we recruit 20 men and assign one type of exercise to 4 men (5 groups). Their weights are recorded after a few weeks. We need to find out whether the effect of these exercises on them is significantly different or not.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:f9216a37-f874-4aad-920b-19877fcc9a41>']}, {'passage': 'References to specific technologies were replaced with just “technology”. Unsuccessful adaptations, or items that were now too similar, were again removed, resulting in 51 items being used for a pilot study. These covered expected aspects of usefulness, enjoyment, ease, confidence, interest, support, and importance. The items included positive and reversed items in order to combat acquiescence bias (Oppenheim, 1998). A small pilot survey (n = 24) was conducted to validate the instrument. It used students from the participant pool expected for the main study, and got a good spread of participants from the target groups (different ages, disciplines, etc). The questionnaire was trialled, and participants interviewed to determine if any questions were unclear, and if they felt anything was missing from the survey. The pilot data was initially checked for errors (e.g. due to duplicate questions). A correlation matrix was checked for items that were highly correlated (> 0.8) with other items (Field, 2005). Where this was found, it was always due to items asking about similar concepts; in all cases, the more clearly-worded item was kept and the other item removed (Oppenheim, 1998). From this, 37 items remained. A principal components analysis (PCA) was run. In order to do this, Horn’s parallel analysis was used to determine how many factors to extract (Horn, 1965). Parallel analysis is considered to be the most accurate method of factor extraction since it outperforms the K1 rule and scree plots (Ledesma & Valero-Mora, 2007; Matsunaga, 2010; O’Connor, 2000; Zwick & Velicer, 1986). Two factors were identified from the parallel analysis. The PCA showed two items loaded onto both factors with a difference of less than 0.4 between the primary and secondary loadings, so these were discarded (Matsunaga, 2010). The first factor contained items about attitudes about technology utility, and the second factor contained items about comfort and confidence when using technology. Internal consistency of the whole attitudes section was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, and was found to be 0.935. The coefficient is sufficiently high, above the minimum recommendation of 0.7 (Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994). It is common for tests with higher numbers of items to result in higher levels of alpha (Tavakol & Dennick, 2011), so the relatively high number of items in this test may explain why alpha is so high. After piloting and validation, 35 items were accepted for use in the final instrument for the main study, which will now be discussed. Technology attitude questionnaire\nThe new instrument is called the Technology Attitude Questionnaire (TAQ), and adapts its 35 attitude items from Al-Emran et al. (2016), Bonanno, and Kommers, P.a.M. (2008), , Edmunds et al. (2012), Jay and Willis (1992), Garland and Noyes (2005), Knezek, Christensen, and Miyashita (1998), Lee and Clarke (2015), Liaw, Huang, and Chen (2007), Nguyen, Hseih, and Allen (2006), Pierce, Stacey, and Barkatsas (2007), Saadé and Kira (2007), Sagin Simsek (2008), Teo (2008), and Teo, Lee, and Chai (2008). In addition to this attitudes section, questions about how students use technology were also included. The TAQ was administered online using Survey Monkey. A copy of the final TAQ is included in the supplementary materials. The TAQ is divided into three sections. The first section gives students a list of 24 types of technology, both hardware (e.g., laptops, mobile telephones, televisions, e-readers) and software (e.g., social networking, office suites, online forums, videos), and explores which of these they have used for course activities, non-course activities, or both. The second section asks how often they use each of the technologies (daily, weekly, monthly, less often than monthly, never, adapted from Kennedy et al. (2010)), and how long they have been using them (less than a year, 1–2 years, 3–5 years, 6–10 years, more than 10 years, never). These first two sections satisfy the behavioural component of attitude, as they describe how the student uses technology (Di Martino & Zan, 2010). The third section explores students’ attitudes to technology and attempts to find underlying factors.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:2767e4e1-1b58-45d8-8cfe-ec79430e9853>']}, {'passage': '2008/9 Schools Wikipedia Selection. Related subjects: Mathematics\nStatistics is a mathematical science pertaining to the collection, analysis, interpretation or explanation, and presentation of data. It is applicable to a wide variety of academic disciplines, from the natural and social sciences to the humanities, and to government and business. Statistical methods can be used to summarize or describe a collection of data; this is called descriptive statistics. In addition, patterns in the data may be modeled in a way that accounts for randomness and uncertainty in the observations, and then used to draw inferences about the process or population being studied; this is called inferential statistics. Both descriptive and inferential statistics comprise applied statistics. There is also a discipline called mathematical statistics, which is concerned with the theoretical basis of the subject. The word statistics is also the plural of statistic (singular), which refers to the result of applying a statistical algorithm to a set of data, as in economic statistics, crime statistics, etc. Statistics arose, no later than the 18th century, from the need of states to collect data on their people and economies, in order to administer them. Its meaning broadened in the early 19th century to include the collection and analysis of data in general. Today statistics is widely employed in government, business, and the natural and social sciences. Because of its origins in government and its data-centric world view, statistics is considered to be not a subfield of mathematics but rather a distinct field that uses mathematics. Its mathematical foundations were laid in the 17th and 18th centuries with the development of probability theory. The method of least squares, a central technique of the discipline, was invented in the early 19th century by several authors. Since then new techniques of probability and statistics have been in continual development. Modern computers have expedited large-scale statistical computation, and have also made possible new methods that would be impractical to perform manually. In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or societal problem, one begins with a process or population to be studied. This might be a population of people in a country, of crystal grains in a rock, or of goods manufactured by a particular factory during a given period. It may instead be a process observed at various times; data collected about this kind of ""population"" constitute what is called a time series. For practical reasons, rather than compiling data about an entire population, one usually studies a chosen subset of the population, called a sample. Data are collected about the sample in an observational or experimental setting. The data are then subjected to statistical analysis, which serves two related purposes: description and inference. - Descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the data, either numerically or graphically, to describe the sample. Basic examples of numerical descriptors include the mean and standard deviation. Graphical summarizations include various kinds of charts and graphs. - Inferential statistics is used to model patterns in the data, accounting for randomness and drawing inferences about the larger population. These inferences may take the form of answers to yes/no questions ( hypothesis testing), estimates of numerical characteristics ( estimation), descriptions of association (correlation), or modeling of relationships (regression). Other modeling techniques include ANOVA, time series, and data mining. |“… it is only the manipulation of uncertainty that interests us. We are not concerned with the matter that is uncertain. Thus we do not study the mechanism of rain; only whether it will rain.”\nDennis Lindley, ""The Philosophy of Statistics"", The Statistician (2000). The concept of correlation is particularly noteworthy. Statistical analysis of a data set may reveal that two variables (that is, two properties of the population under consideration) tend to vary together, as if they are connected. For example, a study of annual income and age of death among people might find that poor people tend to have shorter lives than affluent people. The two variables are said to be correlated. However, one cannot immediately infer the existence of a causal relationship between the two variables (see Correlation does not imply causation). The correlated phenomena could be caused by a third, previously unconsidered phenomenon, called a lurking variable.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:742233a3-c3bd-4a60-9745-638ecdf01d75>']}]","{

Interesting results emerged when we analyzed data from our Camp Invention Research Project: Institute for Learning Innovation study regarding what STEM areas girls and boys enjoy learning about. Using a five-point rating scale with five being the highest, we asked 485 fourth and fifth-grade Camp Invention participants how much they liked finding out about or learning about various STEM topics. These topics were selected to measure interest in three main STEM areas: Life Science, Earth Science, and Technology and Engineering. Utilizing T-Tests, we found that the 209 girls liked finding out about Life Science more than the 276 boys (average rating of 3.69 to 3.37) and that the boys liked finding out about Technology and Engineering more than the girls (average rating of 4.18 to 3.98). While this finding may not be overly surprising to some people, what we found particularly interesting is that no statistically significant difference was found between the reported liking of finding out about Earth Science between the girls and the boys (average rating of 4.15 and 4.00). We also asked the participants to rate their agreement to the question, \u201cMy friends think science and engineering are cool.\u201d\nUtilizing regression models, we found there to be a statistically significant and positive relationship between a participant\u2019s friends thinking science and engineering are cool and their own enjoyment in finding out about all three of the STEM areas! Interestingly, while no difference in the average rating for liking learning about Earth Science was found between the girls and the boys, the relationship between girls\u2019 friends thinking science and engineering is cool and their rating of liking finding out about Earth Science was stronger than for the boys. Indeed, for the girls, we found that for every one-unit increase in the rating of their friends\u2019 thinking science and engineering is cool we could predict a corresponding increase of .21 units in their own rating of liking finding out about Earth Science (the predicted increase for the boys was .19 units). While the statistical tests we utilized don\u2019t prove causation, their statistically significant and predictive quality provides us evidence that there definitely is a positive relationship between friends\u2019 attitudes towards science and engineering and a child\u2019s own enjoyment in finding out about Life Science, Earth Science, and Technology and Engineering. Parents, have you found this to be displayed in your own children\u2019s friendships? For more information on these findings, feel free to contact Data Scientist, David Meier. Posted Mar 30, 2022"",

A 7-point verbal-rating Likert scale was chosen since they are more reliable than 5-point scales, and offer more opportunity to discriminate between values (Schwarz, Kn\u00e4uper, Hippler, Noelle-Neumann, & Clark, 1991). The Likert responses were adapted from Beshai, Branco, and Dobson (2013): 1. \u201cEntirely disagree\u201d, 2. \u201cMostly disagree\u201d, 3. \u201cSomewhat disagree\u201d, 4. \u201cNeither agree nor disagree\u201d, 5. \u201cSomewhat agree\u201d, 6. \u201cMostly agree\u201d, and 7. \u201cEntirely agree\u201d. A \u201cpass\u201d option was also included to allow participants to abstain from each question should they wish. The demographics collected were age group, course discipline by faculty, and whether the participants were full or part time. For analysis, both the individual age groups were used (18\u201321, 22\u201325, 26\u201330, 31\u201340, 41\u201350, 51\u201360, 61\u201370, 71+), as well as collating the participants into \u201cmature\u201d (consisting of the groups aged 26 and over) and \u201cnon-mature\u201d (consisting of the groups under 26) groups. Other demographics such as gender and ethnicity were not collected as they were not to be analysed in this study. Participants for the main study\nThe main study was based at a Russell Group university in Northern England. A request to participate in an online survey was sent to students subscribed to the University\u2019s student volunteers mailing list. Students who completed the survey were eligible to be entered into a prize draw for an Amazon voucher. One hundred ninety four participants began the survey, with 161 participants completing it (83.0% completion rate). All participants gave informed consent. 30% (n = 49) of the sample were mature students, while 70% (n = 112) were non-mature; a more detailed breakdown of the participant ages is given in Table 1. Participants were from a variety of courses and disciplines, shown in Table 2, and both part time (n = 18, 11.2%) and full time students (n = 143, 88.8%) were included. The overall goal was to identify the main attitude dimensions from the TAQ and determine if they were different across the different age groups. The data was analysed using the IBM SPSS Statistics package (IBM Corp, 2013). In order to determine the factor structure of the TAQ, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used, a data-driven method to identify underlying relationships between variables. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy was 0.888 and is therefore considered \u201cgood\u201d (Parsian & Dunning, 2009), and Bartlett\u2019s test of sphericity was significant (\u03c72 (136) = 1712.280, p < 0.001) showing that the data is suitable for factor analysis (Williams, Onsman, & Brown, 2010). Horn\u2019s parallel analysis was used to determine how many factors to extract (Horn, 1965). Three factors were identified by the parallel analysis, but the third factor was considered to be a method factor, as it contained all of the reversed items relating to factor one (Zhang, Noor, & Savalei, 2016). The items loading onto the third factor were therefore removed, giving two final factors. Additionally, items were removed if they had factor loadings below 0.4 and items with cross-loadings over 0.4. In total, 14 items were removed. A two-factor structure with 17 items was confirmed through EFA. For the non-Likert data, the normality of each distribution was assessed using Shapiro-Wilk tests and visual inspection of distributions and Q-Q plots where appropriate (Ghasemi & Zahediasl, 2012). Where the distributions were found to be normal, t-tests were used to assess for differences between the mature and non-mature groups, and analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used to explore the differences between the age groups. Homogeneity of variance was assessed, and Welch\u2019s ANOVA used where the groups\u2019 variances were found to be different. Hedges\u2019 g and eta squared (\u03b72) are used as the respective effect sizes for the t-tests and ANOVAs (Fritz, Morris, & Richler, 2012; Kotrlik & Atherton, 2011; Tomczak & Tomczak, 2014)."",

Middle Schoolers Out to Save the World, two Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education programs with the common goal of improving students\u2019 attitudes about scientific careers. The authors represent two project teams, each with funding from the National Science Foundation\u2019s ITEST program. Using different approaches and technology, both projects challenged students to use electricity monitoring system data to create action plans for conserving energy in their homes and communities. The impact of each project on students\u2019 career interests was assessed via a multi-method evaluation that included the Career Interest Questionnaire (CIQ), a measure that was validated within the context of ITEST projects and has since become one of the instruments used most commonly across the ITEST community. This article explores the extent to which the CIQ can be used to document the effects of technology-enhanced STEM educational experiences on students\u2019 career attitudes and intentions in different environments. The results indicate that the CIQ, and the Intent subscale in particular, served as significant predictors of students\u2019 self-reported STEM career aspirations across project context. Results from each project also demonstrated content gains by students and demonstrated the impact of project participation and gender on student outcomes. The authors conclude that the CIQ is a useful tool for providing empirical evidence to document the impact of technology-enhanced science education programs, particularly with regard to Intent to purse a STEM career. The need for additional cross-project comparison studies is also discussed."",

The goal of replacing electronics with optics for processing data in computers is coming closer through cutting edge European research into the mysterious properties of “fast and slow” light. The long term aim is to boost processing speeds and data storage densities by several orders of magnitude and take the information technology industry into a new era, combining greatly improved performance with dramatically lower energy consumption.
The phenomenon of “fast and slow” light arises from the dispersion of electromagnetic waves when they interact with, and travel through, a physical medium such as a crystal. This can have the effect of slowing down the light pulses, or on occasions appearing to cause local acceleration. These speed variations have the potential for developing purely optical devices using just electromagnetic radiation, rather than electrical signals, to store and process information. In the more immediate future, these properties will be used to enhance existing hybrid communication systems combining electronic and photonic (light-based) devices. But first more fundamental research is needed, and the current state of play along with a roadmap for future projects was discussed at a recent workshop organised by the European Science Foundation (ESF).
The project achieved its main objectives of reviewing the state of the art, highlighting possible applications, and gathering a dispersed European community of scientists, according to the workshop’s convenor Marco Santagiustina. “There were two remarkable highlights: slow and fast light research has immense potential in applications like microwave and millimeter wave photonics, and secondly such applications can be targeted by making progress in a selected set of technologies,” said Santagiustina.
Light signals are already used for communication over fibre optic cables, but cannot yet be stored directly, or used for computation. This would require slowing down the light signals so that they can be buffered within a small area, and can be achieved by exploiting “fast and slow” light effects. Before the arrival of true photonic computing, there is the more immediate prospect of building optical interconnects for example in communication networks, which would reduce latency, the time taken for signals to travel from source to destination. Latency imposed by the communications network has become a significant problem in an age of globalisation where computers in different continents are cooperating in tasks that need to be executed very quickly in fractions of a second.
Another more immediate application of “fast and slow” light is likely to come from the ability in processing ultrawide band microwave signals, for radio communications, both for mobile telephony and wireless LANs. “Fast and slow” light can be harnessed to transmit radio frequencies directly over fibre, making it easier, cheaper, and more efficient to connect up base stations or wireless access points. “Radio over fiber is an existing application field destined to grow in the near future,” said Santagiustina. “This field will also represent a significant step forward for the photonic/electronic convergence. In that area the time-delay/phase-shift provided by slow and fast light devices can yield unprecedented functions.”
Some of these functions have not yet been conceived, but the fundamental point is that converging photonics with electronics reduces delays and increases the bandwidth available, cutting costs and boosting communications capacity.",Comparison,"A question that compares the information in the document to other studies, perspectives, or contexts",Expert,A specialized user with deep understanding of the subject matter,How do the storage capabilities of optical computing systems based on 'fast and slow' light compare to current electronic storage methods?,"Currently, light signals cannot yet be stored directly or used for computation, despite being used for communication over fiber optic cables. To achieve storage, light signals would need to be slowed down so they can be buffered within a small area, which could be accomplished by exploiting 'fast and slow' light effects. The long-term goal is to boost processing speeds and data storage densities by several orders of magnitude while dramatically lowering energy consumption compared to current electronic systems.","Optical computing systems that utilize the principles of ""fast and slow"" light have the potential to significantly enhance data storage capabilities compared to current electronic storage methods. Here's how:

1. **Data Density**: By exploiting the properties of light and its interaction with materials, optical computing systems can achieve much higher data densities. This means more data can be stored in a smaller physical space, which is a major advantage over traditional electronic storage devices like hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs).

2. **Speed**: Light travels faster than electrons, which means data can be read and written at much higher speeds in optical systems. This can lead to faster data access times, which is crucial for high-performance computing applications.

3. **Energy Efficiency**: Optical data storage and processing have the potential to be more energy-efficient than electronic systems. This is because photons (particles of light) can transmit information without the heat generation and energy loss associated with electrical current in electronic systems.

4. **Non-volatility**: Optical storage systems, such as holographic data storage, are inherently non-volatile. This means that data remains stored even when the power is turned off, similar to how data is stored on CDs and DVDs. This contrasts with some electronic storage systems that require constant power to maintain data integrity.

5. **Scalability**: Optical systems can be designed to scale more effectively for larger storage capacities. As the demand for storage continues to grow exponentially, optical solutions can potentially meet these demands more efficiently than electronic systems.

6. **Durability**: Optical storage media, like CDs and DVDs, are known for their durability and resistance to environmental factors that can degrade electronic storage media, such as magnetic fields and temperature fluctuations.

7. **Parallel Processing**: Optical systems can take advantage of the inherent parallelism of light, allowing multiple data streams to be processed simultaneously. This is a significant advantage over electronic systems that typically process data sequentially or with limited parallelism.

However, it's important to note that while optical computing holds great promise, there are still significant technological challenges to overcome before these systems can be widely adopted. These include developing efficient methods for writing and reading data at the nanoscale, creating stable and reliable optical storage media, and integrating optical components with existing electronic infrastructure.

In summary, optical computing systems based on ""fast and slow"" light have the potential to revolutionize data storage by offering higher density, faster speeds, greater energy efficiency, non-volatility, scalability, durability, and parallel processing capabilities compared to current electronic storage methods. However, practical implementation of these systems remains a work in progress.","You are a helpful assistant.

Optical computing is an inherently multidisciplinary subject whose study routinely involves a spectrum of expertise that threads optical physics, materials science, optical engineering, electrical engineering, computer architecture, computer programming, and computer theory. Applying ideas from theoretical computer science, such as analysis of algorithms and computational complexity, enables us to place optical computing in a framework where we can try to answer a number of important questions. For example,which problems are optical computers suitable for solving? Also, how does the resource usage on optical computers compare with more standard (e.g. digital electronic) architectures? The physical principles behind some efficiencies in optical computing are outlined here. 1. Fan-in efficiency
Kirchoff’s Law is well understood in analog electronics as a natural and constant time means of summing the current at the intersection of an arbitrary number of wires. In optics, the same thing is possible by directing several light beams towards a point detector with a linear response to incident light. Such an optical arrangement sums n non-negative integers in O(1) addition steps. On a model of a sequential digital electronic computer this would require n − 1 addition operations and even many typical (bounded fan-in)parallel models, with n or more processors, take O(log n) time steps. Tasks that rely on scalar summation operations (such as matrix multiplication) would benefit greatly from an optical implementation of the scalar sum operation. Similarly, O(1) multiplication and O(1) convolution operations can be realised optically. Very recently, an optics-based digital signal processing platform has been marketed that claims digital processing speeds of tera (10^12) operations per second. 2. Efficiency in interconnection complexity
As optical pathways can cross in free space without measurable effect on the information in either channel, high interconnection densities are possible with optics. Architectures with highly parallel many-to-many interconnections between parallel surfaces have already been proposed for common tasks such as sorting. Currently, intrachip, inter-chip, and inter-board connections are being investigated for manufacturing feasibility. 3. Energy efficiency
Electrical wires suffer from induced noise and heat, which increases dramatically whenever wires are made thinner or placed closer together, or whenever the data throughput is increased. As a direct consequence of their resistance free pathways and noise-reduced environments, optical systems have the potential to generate less waste heat and so consume less energy per computation step than electronic systems. This has beend emonstrated experimentally with general purpose digital optical processors.

Researchers at the Technische Universität Darmstadt in Germany have managed to stop light for up to one minute inside a crystal and store digitally-encoded information inside it. The technique shatters previous records and could prove very useful in developing faster and highly-efficient quantum and optical computers. The switch to photonics
Today's technologies use semiconductor-based processors and storage devices to compute and store data electronically. However, with data being increasingly transmitted in the optical regime (e.g. through fiber optics), switching to all-optical components is appearing more and more like an appealing prospect. Photons are much harder to interact with and manipulate than electrons, but if this hurdle can be cleared, switching from electronics to a photonics ecosystem would bring about many key advantages. Electronic components dissipate a large portion of energy as heat, whereas in photonics components losses are very limited. Optical storage and computation would also be resistant to radiation, have a much higher transmission bandwidth, and allow for the manipulation of a single photon at a time, which would translate into better performance at a tiny fraction of the energy cost. ""Although classical data storage already offers very high read/write rates, optical data storage has the potential to be much faster,"" Georg Heinze, who was part of the research team, told Gizmag. ""If everything operates in the optical regime there is no need to convert optical pulses in electronic signals and vice versa."" Bringing light to a halt
To store data in a photonics device, the researchers use a technique known as electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). EIT consists of firing a laser ""control beam"" at a crystal which contains ions of the element praseodymium. The laser triggers a quantum reaction in the crystal that has two contemporary effects. First, it makes this normally opaque crystal transparent over a narrow spectrum; and secondly, it changes the refractive index of the crystal dramatically, slowing the incoming light pulse down to a complete halt. At this point, the researchers fire a second laser beam (containing the information to be stored) at the crystal. At the precise moment in which the laser beam carrying the information is crossing the temporarily transparent crystal, the control beam is turned off, trapping light and information inside the now opaque crystal. The photons are converted into atomic spin excitations (or ""spin waves""), which can be stored in the crystal until the control beam is fired again and the spin waves are turned back into light, which finally escapes the crystal. Scientists have used this technique in previous experiments, but they could only use it to store data for a few millionths of a second. This is because the spin wave is very delicate, subject to energy fluctuations that can corrupt the information it encodes. The TU Darmstadt team figured out how they could prolong this storage time significantly. Their approach was to develop an algorithm that senses the noise and applies magnetic fields and high-frequency pulses to the crystal to maintain the spin wave in its original state, so that the information is kept safe for as long as possible – up to a minute. ""In this first proof-of-principle experiment we focused on long storage times rather than on transfer rates,"" says Heinze. ""However, we showed that by image storage it is possible to increase the storage capacity of the memory, and this is very important feature for spatially multiplexed quantum memories."" The researchers are now building on this result to try and store light for even longer periods of time (up to a week) in a more energy-efficient way while achieving higher data transfer rates. In a word of caution, however, Heinze points out that it will probably be several years before this technology is ready for commercial use, and possibly decades before all-photonics devices become the norm in consumer devices. The team's research appears on the journal Physical Review Letters.

Scientists from the University of Oxford have developed a tiny nanoscale device that can be programmed using either photons or electrons. This electro-optical device is a bridge between traditional electronic computing and the emerging field of optical computing, and it could lead to faster and more energy-efficient processors and memory in the future. “Computing at the speed of light has been an enticing but elusive prospect, but with this development, it’s now in tangible proximity,” Phys.org reports. Scientists have been trying to use light to transfer information extremely fast since the 1950s. However, there are practical limitations of how light can be used in this manner, especially when trying to integrate it along with electronic computing hardware. The problem is that electrical chips operate most efficiently when they are small in size, but optical chips benefit from being larger. This is because the wavelength of light is larger than that of electrons. The new device uses light which has been compressed into a small size, in a process called surface plasmon polariton. This allows optical chips to be integrated along with electrical chips because now the sizes are more comparable. The ability for devices to work in both electrical and optical domains, without the need for conversion, allows the creation of dual functionalities that can use both photons and electrons for processing. “This is a very promising path forward in computation and especially in fields where high processing efficiency is needed,” Nikolaos Farmakidis, graduate student and co-first author, said in a statement. There are many potential uses of this technology, but the current focus is on applications that require a large amount of processing power, such as artificial intelligence. The new device can improve on current technology like complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication of MOSFETs, which are the transistors that form the basis of many modern digital circuits. Co-author Nathan Youngblood explains the potential applications for the new nanoscale device: “This naturally includes artificial intelligence applications where on many occasions, the needs for high-performance, low-power computing far exceeds our current capabilities. It is believed that interfacing light-based photonic computing with its electrical counterpart is the key to the next chapter in CMOS technologies.”
The findings are published in the journal Science Advances.

Mobile communication for voice applications (e.g., cellular phone) is widely established throughout the world and witnesses a very rapid growth in all its dimensions including the increase in the number of subscribers of various cellular networks. An extension of this technology is the ability to send and receive data across various cellular networks using small devices such as smartphones. There can be numerous applications based on this technology; for example, video call or conferencing is one of the important applications that people prefer to use in place of existing voice (only) communications on mobile phones. Mobile computing–based applications are becoming very important and rapidly evolving with various technological advancements as it allows users to transmit data from remote locations to other remote or fixed locations. 1.9 Quantum Computing
Manufacturers of computing systems say that there is a limit for cram-ming more and more transistors into smaller and smaller spaces of inte-grated circuits (ICs) and thereby doubling the processing power about every 18 months. This problem will have to be overcome by a new quantum
computing–based solution, wherein the dependence is on quantum
7 Computing Paradigms
1.10 Optical Computing
Optical computing system uses the photons in visible light or infrared beams, rather than electric current, to perform digital computations. An elec-tric current flows at only about 10% of the speed of light. This limits the rate at which data can be exchanged over long distances and is one of the factors that led to the evolution of optical fiber. By applying some of the advantages of visible and/or IR networks at the device and component scale, a computer can be developed that can perform operations 10 or more times faster than a conventional electronic computer. Nanocomputing refers to computing systems that are constructed from nanoscale components. The silicon transistors in traditional computers may be replaced by transistors based on carbon nanotubes. The successful realization of nanocomputers relates to the scale and inte-gration of these nanotubes or components. The issues of scale relate to the dimensions of the components; they are, at most, a few nanometers in at least two dimensions. The issues of integration of the components are twofold: first, the manufacture of complex arbitrary patterns may be economically infeasible, and second, nanocomputers may include massive quantities of devices. Researchers are working on all these issues to bring nanocomputing a reality. 1.12 Network Computing
Almost all the computing paradigms that were discussed earlier are of this nature. Even in the future, if any one invents a totally new computing para-digm, it would be based on a networked architecture, without which it is impossible to realize the benefits for any end user. We are into a post-PC era, in which a greater number and a variety of com-puters and computing paradigms with different sizes and functions might be used everywhere and with every human being; so, the purpose of this chap-ter is to illustrate briefly the ideas of all these computing domains, as most of these are ubiquitous and pervasive in its access and working environment. • Mobile computing: Mobile computing consists of small processing elements (i.e., handheld devices) and the communication between various resources is by using wireless media (see Section 1.8). • Nanocomputing: Makes use of nanoscale components (see Section 1.11). 1. Why is it necessary to understand the various computing paradigms? 2. Compare grid computing with electric power grid

The objectives of this chapter are to
• Understand the basic ideas and motivation for cloud computing • To define cloud computing
• Understand the 5-4-3 principles of cloud computing and cloud ecosystem
• Understand the working of a cloud application
• Have a brief understanding on the benefits and drawbacks in cloud computing
2.1 Motivation for Cloud Computing
Let us review the scenario of computing prior to the announcement and availability of cloud computing: The users who are in need of computing are expected to invest money on computing resources such as hardware, software, networking, and storage; this investment naturally costs a bulk currency to the users as they have to buy these computing resources, keep these in their premises, and maintain and make it operational—all these tasks would add cost.

When co-author Zhaoming Zhu, Gauthier's postdoctoral research associate, encoded information onto one of these beams, the data could be imprinted on these newly created phonons and retained for 12 billionths of a second, long enough to be transferred back to light again by shining a third laser through the fiber. ""When thinking about how to store light in optical fibers,"" Zhu says, ""we realized that we can convert optical information to acoustic vibration, something that hasn't been done before."" The researchers are seeking ways to create longer storage times and reduce the peak power of the laser beam needed for retaining and reading out the information, a process that will take years before a commercial version of the technology is available. ""There is still a great need for developing new strategies for optimizing the flow of information over the Internet,"" says Robert Boyd, a professor of optics and physics at the Institute of Optics and a research co-author. ""If two data packets arrive at a switch at the same time, you need to store one until the other packet clears the switch, maybe 100 nanoseconds later. Our technique is aimed at … building buffers for high-speed telecommunications."" During the first phase of the project—which is part of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Defense Sciences Office slow-light program—Zhu says he learned that pulses could be stored and read out at a later time. The second phase was the actual experiment in which data pulses were stored (as acoustic waves in an optical fiber) and retrieved after a certain period of time. ""We really want to demonstrate that methods for storing optical information are much broader than people thought,"" Gauthier says. ""In the current telecommunication systems, you turn the optical signal into an electronic signal and store it in RAM. The optical data pulses are then regenerated by using the electrical signals to turn on and off an auxiliary laser source. But this process generates heat. The faster this is done, the more heat is generated."" For this to work in the real world, the scientists say the communication fibers must be made of a material that provides an acoustic time frame long enough to allow the information to move from optical to sound, then return to optical. One option, Gauthier says, is to work with a new type of glass made from a chalcogenide, which has good semiconductor properties and contains one or more elements from the periodic table's chalcogenide group, also known as the ""oxygen family,"" which includes oxygen, sulfur, selenium and tellurium. Another option that researchers are exploring is to run the laser beams through a hollow optical fiber filled with gas (such as xenon), which would allow them to use a less powerful laser to induce longer lasting sound waves in the gas. This could potentially create a sound wave 50 times longer and allow the lasers used to be 100 times less powerful—and less energy intensive—thereby delivering more data more quickly at a lower cost. New Video VoIP Software, Webcams End That Pixelated Feeling
Skype and Logitech team up to deliver video voice over Internet protocol calls that look more like TV than home videos
Thanks to the rapid-fire growth of broadband network connectivity, video voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) services now give callers around the world the ability to gab away for no more than the cost of their monthly Internet service provider fee. Until now, though, the video capabilities have been little more than a novelty that tempts callers with grainy images of their friends and family that lack the ability to capture their movement with any fluidity. But that could change as early as next month when Luxembourg–based Skype, a division of online auctioneer eBay, is set to unveil the latest version of its software, which is tuned to work with a new lineup of ""high-quality video"" Web cameras from Fremont, Calif.–based Logitech. The companies gave a preview Tuesday of what's to come at a New York City press conference, where they demonstrated their software and hardware working together to produce video VoIP that looks more like watching TV than grainy home movies. This is no small feat, as the laundry list of requirements indicates. What do you need to take advantage of this latest offering?

The growing demands of high definition digital video content, fixed content data, and compliance and security application will soon outstrip the capabilities of current storage technologies to keep up the demand. Clearly a new storage paradigm is needed to meet the growing storage demands. So what is it going to be?With its omnipresent computer, all connected via the internet, the information age has led to an explosion of information available to users. The decreasing cost of storing data and the increasing storage capability of the same small device footprint have been key enablers of this revolution. While current storage needs are being met, storage technology must continue to improve in order to keep pace with the rapidly increasing demand. So how is it going to be?Both magnetic and conventional optical data storage technologies, where individual bits are stored as distinct magnetic or optical changes on the surface of a recording medium are approaching physical limits beyond which individual bits may be too small or too difficult to store. So what next step is going to be?Storing information throughout the volume of a medium, not just on its surface is an intriguing solution to our entire problem regarding storage. So this is it, Holographic Data Storage. Holographic Data Storage is a volumetric approach which, although conceived decades ago, has made recent progress towards practicality with the appearance of lower-cost enabling technologies, significant results from longstanding research efforts and progress in holographic recording materials.This is a quest to find the answer to these entire questions, the technology and the story behind the next revolution in data storage. Advantages of HVD
1. Resistance to damage - If some parts of the medium are damaged, all information can still be obtained from other parts. 2. Efficient retrieval - All information can be retrieved from any part of the medium. 3. These discs have the capacity to hold up to 3.9 terabyte (TB) of information, which is approximately 6,000 times the capacity of a CDROM, 830 times the capacity of a DVD, 160 times the capacity of single-layer Blu-ray-Discs, and about 48 times the capacity of standard computer hard drives. 4. The HVD also has a transfer rate of 1 gigabit/s. 5. While reading a page the entire page of data can be retrieved quickly and at one time .

Memory and storage are two terms that are regularly used to mean the same thing in computer technology. The reason for this is that some devices designed as memory also act as storage devices. There is however a distinction between the two terms. This article discusses the differences. Storage is where programs and other data can be stored permanently. It can also refer to temporary storage which is offered by devices normally meant for memory. Storage holds data and programs in such a way that it can be accessed by the processor through the computer memory. Storage includes hard disk drives and removable devices such as optical disks and memory cards. |Includes cache, primary and secondary memory||Includes storage devices such as optical disks, hard disks and memory cards|
|Easy retrieval of data||Slower access than memory|
|Computer will not run without it||Computer can be used even without it|
|Upgradeable but expensive||Upgradeable and affordable|
|Uses semiconductor chips||Uses magnetic disk technology, optical technology and semiconductor technology|
Memory vs Storage
So what is the difference between memory and storage? Let’s find this out based on types, data access speeds, computer system dependence, cost and technology used. - Memory can refer to any device that stores data and instructions either temporarily or permanently for execution. It includes cache, primary and secondary memory. Storage on the other hand includes storage devices which store data and programs in a semi-permanent or permanent state. The stored data and programs can be accessed by the memory for processing. - Memory is quite fast. The access of data and instructions by the processor needs to be extremely fast to enable efficiency of the computer system. Access to data and programs in storage is relatively slow. This can be seen when you try to watch a DVD video using a computer. The computer will take a few seconds before it identifies the storage media (DVD), reads its contents and runs the appropriate program to enable video watching. - The computer system needs installed memory to run. The memory is the location where all data and instructions needed to execute a program are stored. The storage on the other hand is optional. - Memory can be upgraded by installing higher capacity chips. They are relatively expensive given that they use high speed technology. Upgrading storage is cheaper since storage devices use slower technology. - Memory mainly uses semiconductor chip technology. It’s quite fast but expensive. Storage on the other hand mainly uses magnetic and optical technology. However, emerging trends in storage are making used of solid state drives and semiconductor technology.

In an article published in the trade journal Optics Express, IBM has announced that it is developing technology that may replace current electronic chips in future computers. Rather than using electrical connections, which are prone to overheating and EMI problems, the company is planning to produce processors that use light to carry out calculations. Using micro-miniaturised Mach-Zehnder electro-optic modulators
, IBM hopes to produce chips which are capable of running up to one hundred times faster than is currently possible with traditional CPUs, and some three times faster than the gains promised by recent research into 3D processors
The best news is yet to come: the new chips will do all this and consume somewhere in the region of a tenth
the power of current CPUs. Less power means less heat, which in turn means you can cram more horsepower into a smaller area without worrying about things melting down. You'll have a bit of a wait on your hands for the new light-based superchip, however: the head honcho of the project, Will Green, is predicting commercial availability “in the timeframe of 10 to 15 years. ” Initial batches of the chip have been earmarked by, surprise surprise, the high-tech branch of the Department of Defense - DARPA
- who is partially funding the research project. To allow Will to blow his own trumpet for a moment: “Just like fibre optic networks have enabled the rapid expansion of the Internet by enabling users to exchange huge amounts of data from anywhere in the world, IBM's technology is bringing similar capabilities to the computer chip. While the research is clearly aimed at customers who need big-budget supercomputers, it'll be interesting to see how and when it trickles down to the retail level. Which technology are you betting on – 3D processors or light-based computing? Let us know your thoughts in the forums","[{'passage': 'European light research opens door for optical storage and computing\nThe goal of replacing electronics with optics for processing data in computers is coming closer through cutting edge European research into the mysterious properties of “fast and slow” light. The long term aim is to boost processing speeds and data storage densities by several orders of magnitude and take the information technology industry into a new era, combining greatly improved performance with dramatically lower energy consumption. The phenomenon of “fast and slow” light arises from the dispersion of electromagnetic waves when they interact with, and travel through, a physical medium such as a crystal. This can have the effect of slowing down the light pulses, or on occasions appearing to cause local acceleration. These speed variations have the potential for developing purely optical devices using just electromagnetic radiation, rather than electrical signals, to store and process information. In the more immediate future, these properties will be used to enhance existing hybrid communication systems combining electronic and photonic (light-based) devices. But first more fundamental research is needed, and the current state of play along with a roadmap for future projects was discussed at a recent workshop organised by the European Science Foundation (ESF). The project achieved its main objectives of reviewing the state of the art, highlighting possible applications, and gathering a dispersed European community of scientists, according to the workshop’s convenor Marco Santagiustina. “There were two remarkable highlights: slow and fast light research has immense potential in applications like microwave and millimeter wave photonics, and secondly such applications can be targeted by making progress in a selected set of technologies,” said Santagiustina. Light signals are already used for communication over fibre optic cables, but cannot yet be stored directly, or used for computation. This would require slowing down the light signals so that they can be buffered within a small area, and can be achieved by exploiting “fast and slow” light effects. Before the arrival of true photonic computing, there is the more immediate prospect of building optical interconnects for example in communication networks, which would reduce latency, the time taken for signals to travel from source to destination. Latency imposed by the communications network has become a significant problem in an age of globalisation where computers in different continents are cooperating in tasks that need to be executed very quickly in fractions of a second. Another more immediate application of “fast and slow” light is likely to come from the ability in processing ultrawide band microwave signals, for radio communications, both for mobile telephony and wireless LANs. “Fast and slow” light can be harnessed to transmit radio frequencies directly over fibre, making it easier, cheaper, and more efficient to connect up base stations or wireless access points. “Radio over fiber is an existing application field destined to grow in the near future,” said Santagiustina. “This field will also represent a significant step forward for the photonic/electronic convergence. In that area the time-delay/phase-shift provided by slow and fast light devices can yield unprecedented functions.”\nSome of these functions have not yet been conceived, but the fundamental point is that converging photonics with electronics reduces delays and increases the bandwidth available, cutting costs and boosting communications capacity.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:ce1a9862-3acc-47fe-a46f-5d9cba25c524>']}, {'passage': 'Optical computing is an inherently multidisciplinary subject whose study routinely involves a spectrum of expertise that threads optical physics, materials science, optical engineering, electrical engineering, computer architecture, computer programming, and computer theory. Applying ideas from theoretical computer science, such as analysis of algorithms and computational complexity, enables us to place optical computing in a framework where we can try to answer a number of important questions. For example,which problems are optical computers suitable for solving? Also, how does the resource usage on optical computers compare with more standard (e.g. digital electronic) architectures? The physical principles behind some efficiencies in optical computing are outlined here. 1. Fan-in efficiency\nKirchoff’s Law is well understood in analog electronics as a natural and constant time means of summing the current at the intersection of an arbitrary number of wires. In optics, the same thing is possible by directing several light beams towards a point detector with a linear response to incident light. Such an optical arrangement sums n non-negative integers in O(1) addition steps. On a model of a sequential digital electronic computer this would require n − 1 addition operations and even many typical (bounded fan-in)parallel models, with n or more processors, take O(log n) time steps. Tasks that rely on scalar summation operations (such as matrix multiplication) would benefit greatly from an optical implementation of the scalar sum operation. Similarly, O(1) multiplication and O(1) convolution operations can be realised optically. Very recently, an optics-based digital signal processing platform has been marketed that claims digital processing speeds of tera (10^12) operations per second. 2. Efficiency in interconnection complexity\nAs optical pathways can cross in free space without measurable effect on the information in either channel, high interconnection densities are possible with optics. Architectures with highly parallel many-to-many interconnections between parallel surfaces have already been proposed for common tasks such as sorting. Currently, intrachip, inter-chip, and inter-board connections are being investigated for manufacturing feasibility. 3.

""Although classical data storage already offers very high read/write rates, optical data storage has the potential to be much faster,"" Georg Heinze, who was part of the research team, told Gizmag. ""If everything operates in the optical regime there is no need to convert optical pulses in electronic signals and vice versa."" Bringing light to a halt\nTo store data in a photonics device, the researchers use a technique known as electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). EIT consists of firing a laser ""control beam"" at a crystal which contains ions of the element praseodymium. The laser triggers a quantum reaction in the crystal that has two contemporary effects. First, it makes this normally opaque crystal transparent over a narrow spectrum; and secondly, it changes the refractive index of the crystal dramatically, slowing the incoming light pulse down to a complete halt. At this point, the researchers fire a second laser beam (containing the information to be stored) at the crystal. At the precise moment in which the laser beam carrying the information is crossing the temporarily transparent crystal, the control beam is turned off, trapping light and information inside the now opaque crystal. The photons are converted into atomic spin excitations (or ""spin waves""), which can be stored in the crystal until the control beam is fired again and the spin waves are turned back into light, which finally escapes the crystal. Scientists have used this technique in previous experiments, but they could only use it to store data for a few millionths of a second. This is because the spin wave is very delicate, subject to energy fluctuations that can corrupt the information it encodes. The TU Darmstadt team figured out how they could prolong this storage time significantly. Their approach was to develop an algorithm that senses the noise and applies magnetic fields and high-frequency pulses to the crystal to maintain the spin wave in its original state, so that the information is kept safe for as long as possible – up to a minute. ""In this first proof-of-principle experiment we focused on long storage times rather than on transfer rates,"" says Heinze. ""However, we showed that by image storage it is possible to increase the storage capacity of the memory, and this is very important feature for spatially multiplexed quantum memories."" The researchers are now building on this result to try and store light for even longer periods of time (up to a week) in a more energy-efficient way while achieving higher data transfer rates. In a word of caution, however, Heinze points out that it will probably be several years before this technology is ready for commercial use, and possibly decades before all-photonics devices become the norm in consumer devices.

Optical storage and computation would also be resistant to radiation, have a much higher transmission bandwidth, and allow for the manipulation of a single photon at a time, which would translate into better performance at a tiny fraction of the energy cost. ""Although classical data storage already offers very high read/write rates, optical data storage has the potential to be much faster,"" Georg Heinze, who was part of the research team, told Gizmag. ""If everything operates in the optical regime there is no need to convert optical pulses in electronic signals and vice versa."" Bringing light to a halt\nTo store data in a photonics device, the researchers use a technique known as electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). EIT consists of firing a laser ""control beam"" at a crystal which contains ions of the element praseodymium. The laser triggers a quantum reaction in the crystal that has two contemporary effects. First, it makes this normally opaque crystal transparent over a narrow spectrum; and secondly, it changes the refractive index of the crystal dramatically, slowing the incoming light pulse down to a complete halt. At this point, the researchers fire a second laser beam (containing the information to be stored) at the crystal. At the precise moment in which the laser beam carrying the information is crossing the temporarily transparent crystal, the control beam is turned off, trapping light and information inside the now opaque crystal. The photons are converted into atomic spin excitations (or ""spin waves""), which can be stored in the crystal until the control beam is fired again and the spin waves are turned back into light, which finally escapes the crystal. Scientists have used this technique in previous experiments, but they could only use it to store data for a few millionths of a second. This is because the spin wave is very delicate, subject to energy fluctuations that can corrupt the information it encodes. The TU Darmstadt team figured out how they could prolong this storage time significantly. Their approach was to develop an algorithm that senses the noise and applies magnetic fields and high-frequency pulses to the crystal to maintain the spin wave in its original state, so that the information is kept safe for as long as possible – up to a minute. ""In this first proof-of-principle experiment we focused on long storage times rather than on transfer rates,"" says Heinze. ""However, we showed that by image storage it is possible to increase the storage capacity of the memory, and this is very important feature for spatially multiplexed quantum memories."" The researchers are now building on this result to try and store light for even longer periods of time (up to a week) in a more energy-efficient way while achieving higher data transfer rates. In a word of caution, however, Heinze points out that it will probably be several years before this technology is ready for commercial use, and possibly decades before all-photonics devices become the norm in consumer devices. The team\'s research appears on the journal Physical Review Letters.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:2f9ffff8-8798-400d-b8ac-adfdef0f39ef>']}, {'passage': 'Scientists from the University of Oxford have developed a tiny nanoscale device that can be programmed using either photons or electrons. This electro-optical device is a bridge between traditional electronic computing and the emerging field of optical computing, and it could lead to faster and more energy-efficient processors and memory in the future. “Computing at the speed of light has been an enticing but elusive prospect, but with this development, it’s now in tangible proximity,” Phys.org reports. Scientists have been trying to use light to transfer information extremely fast since the 1950s. However, there are practical limitations of how light can be used in this manner, especially when trying to integrate it along with electronic computing hardware. The problem is that electrical chips operate most efficiently when they are small in size, but optical chips benefit from being larger. This is because the wavelength of light is larger than that of electrons. The new device uses light which has been compressed into a small size, in a process called surface plasmon polariton. This allows optical chips to be integrated along with electrical chips because now the sizes are more comparable. The ability for devices to work in both electrical and optical domains, without the need for conversion, allows the creation of dual functionalities that can use both photons and electrons for processing. “This is a very promising path forward in computation and especially in fields where high processing efficiency is needed,” Nikolaos Farmakidis, graduate student and co-first author, said in a statement. There are many potential uses of this technology, but the current focus is on applications that require a large amount of processing power, such as artificial intelligence. The new device can improve on current technology like complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication of MOSFETs, which are the transistors that form the basis of many modern digital circuits. Co-author Nathan Youngblood explains the potential applications for the new nanoscale device: “This naturally includes artificial intelligence applications where on many occasions, the needs for high-performance, low-power computing far exceeds our current capabilities. It is believed that interfacing light-based photonic computing with its electrical counterpart is the key to the next chapter in CMOS technologies.”\nThe findings are published in the journal Science Advances.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:84cc7973-2b66-4130-8e98-d69e2e42381b>']}, {'passage': 'Mobile communication for voice applications (e.g., cellular phone) is widely established throughout the world and witnesses a very rapid growth in all its dimensions including the increase in the number of subscribers of various cellular networks. An extension of this technology is the ability to send and receive data across various cellular networks using small devices such as smartphones. There can be numerous applications based on this technology; for example, video call or conferencing is one of the important applications that people prefer to use in place of existing voice (only) communications on mobile phones. Mobile computing–based applications are becoming very important and rapidly evolving with various technological advancements as it allows users to transmit data from remote locations to other remote or fixed locations. 1.9 Quantum Computing\nManufacturers of computing systems say that there is a limit for cram-ming more and more transistors into smaller and smaller spaces of inte-grated circuits (ICs) and thereby doubling the processing power about every 18 months.

An elec-tric current flows at only about 10% of the speed of light. This limits the rate at which data can be exchanged over long distances and is one of the factors that led to the evolution of optical fiber. By applying some of the advantages of visible and/or IR networks at the device and component scale, a computer can be developed that can perform operations 10 or more times faster than a conventional electronic computer. Nanocomputing refers to computing systems that are constructed from nanoscale components. The silicon transistors in traditional computers may be replaced by transistors based on carbon nanotubes. The successful realization of nanocomputers relates to the scale and inte-gration of these nanotubes or components. The issues of scale relate to the dimensions of the components; they are, at most, a few nanometers in at least two dimensions. The issues of integration of the components are twofold: first, the manufacture of complex arbitrary patterns may be economically infeasible, and second, nanocomputers may include massive quantities of devices. Researchers are working on all these issues to bring nanocomputing a reality. 1.12 Network Computing\nAlmost all the computing paradigms that were discussed earlier are of this nature. Even in the future, if any one invents a totally new computing para-digm, it would be based on a networked architecture, without which it is impossible to realize the benefits for any end user. We are into a post-PC era, in which a greater number and a variety of com-puters and computing paradigms with different sizes and functions might be used everywhere and with every human being; so, the purpose of this chap-ter is to illustrate briefly the ideas of all these computing domains, as most of these are ubiquitous and pervasive in its access and working environment. • Mobile computing: Mobile computing consists of small processing elements (i.e., handheld devices) and the communication between various resources is by using wireless media (see Section 1.8). • Nanocomputing: Makes use of nanoscale components (see Section 1.11). 1.

""When thinking about how to store light in optical fibers,"" Zhu says, ""we realized that we can convert optical information to acoustic vibration, something that hasn\'t been done before."" The researchers are seeking ways to create longer storage times and reduce the peak power of the laser beam needed for retaining and reading out the information, a process that will take years before a commercial version of the technology is available. ""There is still a great need for developing new strategies for optimizing the flow of information over the Internet,"" says Robert Boyd, a professor of optics and physics at the Institute of Optics and a research co-author. ""If two data packets arrive at a switch at the same time, you need to store one until the other packet clears the switch, maybe 100 nanoseconds later. Our technique is aimed at … building buffers for high-speed telecommunications."" During the first phase of the project—which is part of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\'s (DARPA) Defense Sciences Office slow-light program—Zhu says he learned that pulses could be stored and read out at a later time. The second phase was the actual experiment in which data pulses were stored (as acoustic waves in an optical fiber) and retrieved after a certain period of time. ""We really want to demonstrate that methods for storing optical information are much broader than people thought,"" Gauthier says. ""In the current telecommunication systems, you turn the optical signal into an electronic signal and store it in RAM. The optical data pulses are then regenerated by using the electrical signals to turn on and off an auxiliary laser source. But this process generates heat. The faster this is done, the more heat is generated."" For this to work in the real world, the scientists say the communication fibers must be made of a material that provides an acoustic time frame long enough to allow the information to move from optical to sound, then return to optical. One option, Gauthier says, is to work with a new type of glass made from a chalcogenide, which has good semiconductor properties and contains one or more elements from the periodic table\'s chalcogenide group, also known as the ""oxygen family,"" which includes oxygen, sulfur, selenium and tellurium. Another option that researchers are exploring is to run the laser beams through a hollow optical fiber filled with gas (such as xenon), which would allow them to use a less powerful laser to induce longer lasting sound waves in the gas. This could potentially create a sound wave 50 times longer and allow the lasers used to be 100 times less powerful—and less energy intensive—thereby delivering more data more quickly at a lower cost.

But that could change as early as next month when Luxembourg–based Skype, a division of online auctioneer eBay, is set to unveil the latest version of its software, which is tuned to work with a new lineup of ""high-quality video"" Web cameras from Fremont, Calif.–based Logitech.

The reason for this is that some devices designed as memory also act as storage devices. There is however a distinction between the two terms. This article discusses the differences. Storage is where programs and other data can be stored permanently. It can also refer to temporary storage which is offered by devices normally meant for memory. Storage holds data and programs in such a way that it can be accessed by the processor through the computer memory. Storage includes hard disk drives and removable devices such as optical disks and memory cards. |Includes cache, primary and secondary memory||Includes storage devices such as optical disks, hard disks and memory cards|\n|Easy retrieval of data||Slower access than memory|\n|Computer will not run without it||Computer can be used even without it|\n|Upgradeable but expensive||Upgradeable and affordable|\n|Uses semiconductor chips||Uses magnetic disk technology, optical technology and semiconductor technology|\nMemory vs Storage\nSo what is the difference between memory and storage? Let’s find this out based on types, data access speeds, computer system dependence, cost and technology used. - Memory can refer to any device that stores data and instructions either temporarily or permanently for execution. It includes cache, primary and secondary memory. Storage on the other hand includes storage devices which store data and programs in a semi-permanent or permanent state. The stored data and programs can be accessed by the memory for processing. - Memory is quite fast. The access of data and instructions by the processor needs to be extremely fast to enable efficiency of the computer system. Access to data and programs in storage is relatively slow. This can be seen when you try to watch a DVD video using a computer. The computer will take a few seconds before it identifies the storage media (DVD), reads its contents and runs the appropriate program to enable video watching. - The computer system needs installed memory to run. The memory is the location where all data and instructions needed to execute a program are stored. The storage on the other hand is optional. - Memory can be upgraded by installing higher capacity chips. They are relatively expensive given that they use high speed technology. Upgrading storage is cheaper since storage devices use slower technology. - Memory mainly uses semiconductor chip technology. It’s quite fast but expensive.

                ""text"": ""European light research opens door for optical storage and computing\nThe goal of replacing electronics with optics for processing data in computers is coming closer through cutting edge European research into the mysterious properties of \u201cfast and slow\u201d light. The long term aim is to boost processing speeds and data storage densities by several orders of magnitude and take the information technology industry into a new era, combining greatly improved performance with dramatically lower energy consumption. The phenomenon of \u201cfast and slow\u201d light arises from the dispersion of electromagnetic waves when they interact with, and travel through, a physical medium such as a crystal. This can have the effect of slowing down the light pulses, or on occasions appearing to cause local acceleration. These speed variations have the potential for developing purely optical devices using just electromagnetic radiation, rather than electrical signals, to store and process information. In the more immediate future, these properties will be used to enhance existing hybrid communication systems combining electronic and photonic (light-based) devices. But first more fundamental research is needed, and the current state of play along with a roadmap for future projects was discussed at a recent workshop organised by the European Science Foundation (ESF). The project achieved its main objectives of reviewing the state of the art, highlighting possible applications, and gathering a dispersed European community of scientists, according to the workshop\u2019s convenor Marco Santagiustina. \u201cThere were two remarkable highlights: slow and fast light research has immense potential in applications like microwave and millimeter wave photonics, and secondly such applications can be targeted by making progress in a selected set of technologies,\u201d said Santagiustina. Light signals are already used for communication over fibre optic cables, but cannot yet be stored directly, or used for computation. This would require slowing down the light signals so that they can be buffered within a small area, and can be achieved by exploiting \u201cfast and slow\u201d light effects. Before the arrival of true photonic computing, there is the more immediate prospect of building optical interconnects for example in communication networks, which would reduce latency, the time taken for signals to travel from source to destination. Latency imposed by the communications network has become a significant problem in an age of globalisation where computers in different continents are cooperating in tasks that need to be executed very quickly in fractions of a second. Another more immediate application of \u201cfast and slow\u201d light is likely to come from the ability in processing ultrawide band microwave signals, for radio communications, both for mobile telephony and wireless LANs. \u201cFast and slow\u201d light can be harnessed to transmit radio frequencies directly over fibre, making it easier, cheaper, and more efficient to connect up base stations or wireless access points. \u201cRadio over fiber is an existing application field destined to grow in the near future,\u201d said Santagiustina. \u201cThis field will also represent a significant step forward for the photonic/electronic convergence. In that area the time-delay/phase-shift provided by slow and fast light devices can yield unprecedented functions.\u201d\nSome of these functions have not yet been conceived, but the fundamental point is that converging photonics with electronics reduces delays and increases the bandwidth available, cutting costs and boosting communications capacity."",

                ""text"": ""A microscopic device for storing light developed by researchers at Cornell University could help free up bottlenecks in optical communications and computing. This could potentially improve computer and communications speeds by an order of magnitude. The new device relies on an optically controlled \u201cgate\u201d that can be opened and closed to trap and release light. Temporarily storing light pulses could make it possible to control the order in which bits of information are sent, as well as the timing, both of which are essential for routing communications via fiber optics. Today, such routing is done, for the most part, electronically, a slow and inefficient process that requires converting light pulses into electrons and back again. In computers, optical memory could also make possible optical communication between devices on computer chips. Switching to optical routing has been a challenge because pulses of light, unlike electrons, are difficult to control. One way to slow down the pulses and control their movement would be to temporarily confine them to a small continuous loop. (See \u201cTiny Device Stores Light.\u201d) But the problem with this approach is getting the light in and out of such a trap, since any entry point will also serve as an exit that would allow light to escape. What\u2019s needed is a way to close the entryway once the light has entered, and to do so very quickly\u2013in less time than it takes for the light to circle around the loop and escape. Later, when the light pulse is needed, the entryway could be opened again. The Cornell researchers, led by Michal Lipson, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the university, use a very fast, 1.5-picosecond pulse of light to open and close the entryway. The Cornell device includes two parallel silicon tracks, each 560 nanometers wide. Between these two tracks, and nearly touching them, are two silicon rings spaced a fraction of the width of a hair apart. To trap the light in these rings, the researchers turned to some of their earlier work, in which they found that the rings can be tuned to detour different colors by shining a brief pulse of light on them. Light of a certain color passes along the silicon track, takes a detour through one of the rings, and then rejoins the silicon track and continues on its way. However, if the rings are retuned to the same frequency the moment after a light pulse enters a ring, the light pulse will circulate between the rings in a continuous loop rather than rejoin the silicon track and escape. Tuning the rings to different frequencies again, such as by shining another pulse on one of the rings, allows the light to escape this circuit and continue on to its destination. Work remains to be done before such a device will function in a commercial system. So far, the rings only capture part of a pulse of light. As a result, any information encoded in the shape of the overall pulse is lost. This can be solved by compressing the pulse and using a cascade of rings, says Mehmet Yanik, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT. The other issue is that the length of time a light pulse can be stored is relatively short, Lipson says. If the light stays in the ring for too long, it will be too weak to use. Lipson says it might be possible to make up for light losses by amplifying the light signal after it leaves the rings to restore any lost power. Other schemes for storing light have been demonstrated in the past, but these were impractical, requiring carefully controlled conditions, for example, or a large, complicated system. The new approach is an important step forward because it makes it possible to store light in ambient conditions and in a very small device, says Marin Soljacic, a professor of physics at MIT. Once you\u2019ve done that, he says, \u201cthen it becomes interesting to industry.\u201d"",

                ""text"": ""Optical computing is an inherently multidisciplinary subject whose study routinely involves a spectrum of expertise that threads optical physics, materials science, optical engineering, electrical engineering, computer architecture, computer programming, and computer theory. Applying ideas from theoretical computer science, such as analysis of algorithms and computational complexity, enables us to place optical computing in a framework where we can try to answer a number of important questions. For example,which problems are optical computers suitable for solving? Also, how does the resource usage on optical computers compare with more standard (e.g. digital electronic) architectures? The physical principles behind some efficiencies in optical computing are outlined here. 1. Fan-in efficiency\nKirchoff\u2019s Law is well understood in analog electronics as a natural and constant time means of summing the current at the intersection of an arbitrary number of wires. In optics, the same thing is possible by directing several light beams towards a point detector with a linear response to incident light. Such an optical arrangement sums n non-negative integers in O(1) addition steps. On a model of a sequential digital electronic computer this would require n \u2212 1 addition operations and even many typical (bounded fan-in)parallel models, with n or more processors, take O(log n) time steps. Tasks that rely on scalar summation operations (such as matrix multiplication) would benefit greatly from an optical implementation of the scalar sum operation. Similarly, O(1) multiplication and O(1) convolution operations can be realised optically. Very recently, an optics-based digital signal processing platform has been marketed that claims digital processing speeds of tera (10^12) operations per second. 2. Efficiency in interconnection complexity\nAs optical pathways can cross in free space without measurable effect on the information in either channel, high interconnection densities are possible with optics. Architectures with highly parallel many-to-many interconnections between parallel surfaces have already been proposed for common tasks such as sorting. Currently, intrachip, inter-chip, and inter-board connections are being investigated for manufacturing feasibility. 3. Energy efficiency\nElectrical wires suffer from induced noise and heat, which increases dramatically whenever wires are made thinner or placed closer together, or whenever the data throughput is increased. As a direct consequence of their resistance free pathways and noise-reduced environments, optical systems have the potential to generate less waste heat and so consume less energy per computation step than electronic systems. This has beend emonstrated experimentally with general purpose digital optical processors."",

In such a landscape, knowledge can’t help but fall prey to illusion, albeit an illusion that is deeply seductive, with its promise that speed can lead us to more illumination, that it is more important to react than to think deeply, that something must be attached to every bit of time.

Montaigne portrait – Dali 1947
Meditation is a rich and powerful method of study for anyone who knows how to examine his mind, and to employ it vigorously. I would rather shape my soul than furnish it. There is no exercise that is either feeble or more strenuous, according to the nature of the mind concerned, than that of conversing with one’s own thoughts. The greatest men make it their vocation, “those for whom to live is to think. – Montaigne
“Meditation,” here, is taken to mean “cerebration,” vigorous thinking — the same practice John Dewey addressed so eloquently a few centuries later in How We Think. This conflation, at first glance, seems rather antithetical to today’s notion of meditation — a practice often mistakenly interpreted by non-practitioners as non-thinking, an emptying of one’s mind, a cultivation of cognitive passivity. In reality, however, meditation requires an active, mindful presence, a bearing witness to one’s inner experience as it unfolds. In that regard, despite the semantic evolution of the word itself, Montaigne’s actual practice of meditation was very much aligned with the modern concept and thus centuries ahead of his time, as were a great deal of his views.
The great majority of men and women, in ordinary times, pass through life without ever contemplating or criticising, as a whole, either their own conditions or those of the world at large. They find themselves born into a certain place in society, and they accept what each day brings forth, without any effort of thought beyond what the immediate present requires…they seek the satisfaction of the needs of the moment, without much forethought, and without considering that by sufficient effort the whole condition of their lives could be changed…It is only a few rare and exceptional men who have that kind of love toward mankind at large that makes them unable to endure patiently the general mass of evil and suffering, regardless of any relation it may have to their own lives. These few, driven by sympathetic pain, will seek, first in thought and then in action, for some way…

…it will be well to consider…what is the value of philosophy and why it ought to be studied. It is the more necessary to consider this question, in view of the fact that many men, under the influence of science or of practical affairs, are inclined to doubt whether philosophy is anything better than innocent but useless trifling, hair-splitting distinctions, and controversies on matters concerning which knowledge is impossible.
The value of philosophy is, in fact, to be sought largely in its very uncertainty. The man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense, from the habitual beliefs of his age or his nation, and from convictions which have grown up in his mind without the co-operation or consent of his deliberate reason. To such a man the world tends to become definite, finite, obvious; common objects rouse no questions, and unfamiliar possibilities are contemptuously rejected. As soon as we begin to philosophize, on the contrary, we find, as we saw in our opening chapters, that even the most everyday things lead to problems to which only very incomplete answers can be given. Philosophy, though unable to tell us with certainty what is the true answer to the doubts which it raises, is able to suggest many possibilities which enlarge our thoughts and free them from the tyranny of custom. Thus, while diminishing our feeling of certainty as to what things are, it greatly increases our knowledge as to what they may be; it removes the somewhat arrogant dogmatism of those who have never travelled into the region of liberating doubt, and it keeps alive our sense of wonder by showing familiar things in an unfamiliar aspect.
“I’ve always tried to make a home for myself, but I have not felt at home in myself. I’ve worked hard at being the hero of my own life. But every time I checked the register of displaced persons, I was still on it. I didn’t know how to belong. Longing? Yes. Belonging? No.”

### Context: Why study Philosophy? 6 reasons of weight
At a time when everything must be valued according to the price that can be paid for it in the market, philosophy is increasingly cornered: it is forgotten and undervalued in the political reforms of education. Now, that does not mean that this training option has no value, on the contrary. Studying philosophy means learning skills that will hardly be developed in other disciplines. And is that There are plenty of reasons to study philosophy , shortly we learn about the nature of this source of knowledge. In the following lines we will see the most remarkable. - Related article: ""How are Psychology and Philosophy alike?"" Why study philosophy? This is a selection of those strengths that philosophy offers to those people who decide to learn from it. They are not ordered according to a certain criterion, but you can order them in your head, highlighting those that most appeal to you. If you're wondering why study philosophy , it will be very useful. 1. Offers a better scientific knowledge
Science is a type of knowledge-gathering method that has proven to be incredibly valuable for centuries. Now, in practice, knowledge of science does not always imply interpreting the data that your research methods offer us. And is that many times we believe that scientific information is given by nature and convey an obvious meaning to anyone who knows, but this is not so. The philosophy of science it allows us to know if certain interpretations of data are adequate or not, if the research methods used allow us to draw the conclusions we want, or even if the hypotheses from which we start are defective. Thus, the training in philosophy is an excellent complement for science-based careers, on the one hand, and also allow for carving out a career as consultant science philosophers that can guide teams of researchers to review the approaches of their studies. 2. It is suitable for curious minds
Philosophy is the formative career par excellence for curious people, interested in the big questions about life and about existence . For example: what do we live for? What can we know? What exists and what does not? How should we behave to be good? In practice, the amount of questions of this type that philosophers can come to think is infinite and, although they do not usually reach conclusions that completely satisfy their initial curiosity, the hunger to know more and more leads them to organize their ideas in an increasingly sophisticated way . - Maybe you're interested: ""123 wise phrases to reflect on life""
3. It allows to develop constructive criticisms
The world moves more and more by the logic imposed by the market, and that is why it is good to maintain a perspoective distance from this system and raise criticisms of those relations and trade dynamics from which it is so difficult to escape. Philosophy was born just for this: to question the most widespread beliefs, those that dominate our minds so much that we do not even consider them beliefs, but absolute truths. In this way, studying philosophy provides a rational counterpoint that makes it possible to have a different mentality, able to detect anomalies where other people can not, and that therefore makes social change possible. - Maybe it interests you: ""Are we rational or emotional beings?"" 4. It can be applied to one's life
Many of the questions posed by philosophy have personal implications. For example, the existential crisis is not the same if you already have an experience in this field , and the same happens with doubts about how to act correctly and what kind of behaviors should be avoided. In other words, philosophical activity does not take place outside personal life; They usually merge into one thing. 5. It helps us to reinterpret the world
Philosophy is not exactly a form of therapy, but it does allow you to reach stimulating reflections on their own experiences, the world, personal relationships and everything that surrounds us. So, it makes it easier for us to find alternative ways of interpretation, those that satisfy us more and allow us to be happy. In the end, given that we can never have a totally objective vision of reality, it is better to direct our subjectivity towards what brings us closer to happiness and well-being. 6. It allows detecting manipulation attempts
The analysis of discourses is one of the areas in which philosophy is most useful.

- Inductive reasoning is a method of logical thinking wherein broad generalizations and theories are derived from specific examples and observations. - Deductive reasoning, on the other hand, is opposite of inductive reasoning. It is the method wherein specific ideas and conclusions are derived from general statements and hypotheses. - Metaphysics is the branch or type of philosophy that focuses on finding answers to questions about nature, reality, and the physical universe. - Axiology is the type or branch of philosophy that studies fundamental values and principles. - Epistemology is the branch or type of philosophy that scrutinizes how we, people, are able to learn and understand what we know. Why Do We Study Philosophy? Philosophy in life is extremely important. Why? It is because philosophy is like a way of life. It is a way of thinking, understanding, and gaining wisdom about human life, the reality, and the world. All of us are taught about philosophy at school because it is important to study about philosophy as we grow and become adults and as we fully embrace the reality of life. Here are 10 reasons why we study philosophy:
1) To become a person of our own
With philosophy, we are able to think and become a person of our own. It enables us to not become just a “yes person”, who does not know how to think and decide for himself / herself. It gives us the ability to think critically, especially in real life situations. With this, philosophy also takes courage to be independent and decide for the self. 2) To get ready and succeed in various fields of expertise and careers
When we study philosophy, we develop many essential skills such as reading, writing, speaking, reasoning, thinking, learning, adapting, communicating, and organizing. Now, these skills are very important in the real world, especially at the workplace where we need to perform and excel. Without these skills, we will be forever stuck and dependent on our families, especially our parents. 3) To realize your own understanding of what success is
Success varies in different people and through philosophy, you will be able to realize and discover the meaning of success to you. Philosophy encourages you to think deeply, confront yourself, and know the answers, especially when it comes to questions about values, success, and fulfillment. 4) To be able to get great scores in standardized exams
Philosophy centers on critical, analytical, and logical thinking. Therefore, philosophy helps us figure out the correct answers in standardized tests like LSAT, GRE, MCAT, and GMAT. It is because these standardized exams are filled with philosophical questions and problems. 5) To grow and become a well informed citizen
Being an informed citizen does not only mean watching or reading the news everyday or surfing the web every hour. Being a well informed citizen means that beyond all the information overload that we are bombarded with everyday, we are able to think critically and behave according to what and why we know. 6) To have the potential to earn higher income
Philosophy stimulates the mind like no other field of study. This is the reason why so-called philosophers are very intelligent people full of wisdom. Now, when we study philosophy, we are able to develop our knowledge and wisdom to prepare for the real world of working and competition. We could have the potential to earn higher income through our learnings from philosophy. 7) To gain wisdom about ethical principles and their practice in real life
Through philosophy, we are able to learn about ethics, life, family, work, and social principles. With these ethical principles, we can be able to think and act ethically to various types of discussions, arguments, and situations. 8) To become a valuable and effective communicator
Philosophy teaches us the value of communication for personal and societal growth. When we study philosophy, our communication skills are also developed and enhanced. This further enables us to become excellent communicators who express our ideas, opinions, and theories effectively and intelligently. 9) To be able to determine our chosen path
Analytical thinking allows us to reflect on our deepest needs, desire, and passion. Philosophy helps us become analytical thinkers who are capable to know the best career path for ourselves so that we will not be wasting our time with the wrong choice or decision. 10) To get ready for a possible career in law
Some of us want to partake in the world of law by becoming lawyers or attorneys.

Why Study Philosophy?Page address: https://www.mnsu.edu/philosophy/whystudy.html
The great virtue of philosophy is that it teaches not what to think, but how to think. It is the study of meaning, of the principles underlying conduct, thought and knowledge. The skills it hones are the ability to think critically and creatively, to question orthodoxies, and to express ideas clearly. While only a small proportion of philosophy majors go on to become professional philosophers, they flourish in a surprisingly diverse range of career fields. Philosophy has always been excellent training for the law, but it is equally useful for computer scientists. Philosophy majors have the highest acceptance rate to US medical schools, compared with all other majors. And more and more businesses recognize the valuable skills that philosophy majors bring to the workplace. Studying philosophy helps one become a truly independent thinker. And that is the ultimate transferable job skill. Philosophy in the Job Market

What You Can't Do with a Degree in Philosophy
The list of things you can't do with a philosophy degree would be much shorter than the list of things you can do with one. A great many employers (see this and this) actively seek out students who have demonstrated abilities in such areas as communication, analytic thinking, and problem-solving areas that receive a great deal of attention in the philosophy classroom! Indeed, philosophy majors tend to be very competitive in areas such as law, business, and medicine:
- Philosophy majors rank third highest on the LSAT. - Philosophy majors ranked the highest among majors on both the verbal section and the analytic section of the GRE in the period from 2001 to 2004. Among humanities and social science majors, philosophy majors ranked highest on the quantitative section as well. - According to
The Economist, ""philosophy students do better in examinations for business and management schools than anybody except mathematicians"", better even than those who study economics, business or other vocational subjects. - A recent study by the American Medical Association found that philosophy majors enjoyed the third highest acceptance rate into American medical schools. Philosophy majors address the fundamental questions by developing foundational cognitive skills. They learn to question the things most people take for granted and they learn how to go about pursuing the answers to those questions. In the words of a 1998 editorial from the Times of London, ""The great virtue of philosophy is that it teaches not what to think, but how to think."" Because of this, a philosophical education is a valuable foundation for just about any career, and just about any sort of life. Many philosophy majors go into business (investment banking is a popular option). Many others go into law (including Justices Stephen Breyer and David Souter of the US Supreme Court). Some become novelists (Philip K. Dick, David Foster Wallace, Pearl S. Buck), artists (Robert Motherwell, Barnett Newman), film critics (Pauline Kael, Gene Siskel) or entertainers (Harrison Ford, David Duchovny, Steve Martin, Bruce Lee). Some become doctors, or study ethics and serve on advisory boards to hospitals. Some go into politics (Robert McNamara, William Bennett, Jerry Brown, Bill Clinton). Many teach: some in the public school system, others at the university level. And some,like Martin Luther King, fundamentally change the world we live in. The ancient Greek philosopher Socrates said, ""the unexamined life is not worth living."" Perhaps living an unexamined life is the only thing a person with a degree in philosophy cannot do.

If any of my readers have any experience applying to graduate schools, I’m looking for advice and feedback on my statement of purpose. Highlighted sections are areas that I think may need some work. One of the things that I believe most firmly is that the world would benefit from having more philosophy. I am a philosophy student, and philosophy is an integral part of my life. I write a philosophy blog, I read philosophy books, and I attend philosophy discussion groups. It’s most pervasive influence however is that it has become the lens through which I view life. For though philosophy is, in a sense, in the metaphorical lens manufacturing business, I think in many ways the main benefit of philosophy is that you get a feel for the nature of the lenses themselves. To a certain extent philosophy helps us get outside of ourselves; something which I believe is invaluable, not just in academic study but also in our personal lives. I want philosophy to be my life’s work, but by this I do not just mean that I want to study philosophy academically – I am also interested in cultivating the philosophical mindset in society and government. I think the factor that has played the biggest role in my philosophical development is my interdisciplinary education at Quest University Canada. The philosophical courses that I took were excellent, but I think I got far more out of them then I otherwise would because they were situated in a broader context. My understanding of freewill was shaped by Kant and Dostoyevsky, but also by studies in molecular biology. My understanding of human nature was informed by Heidegger and evolutionary psychology. To learn about politics I’ve studied Plato, and I’ve also studied governmental systems and modern media theory. I have found that all of my studies’ have been mutually supportive, and that the most valuable contribution of philosophy is the critical mindset that it fosters. My opinion of the value of this mindset was reinforced to m by my experience working as a peer tutor at Quest. I edited papers from a wide variety of fields, including economics, ecology, biology, and many others. What I continuously found was that clarity of thought was the essential differentiating factor between good and bad papers, and that often the best way to help the other student was to try to draw them into a critical analysis of their own thoughts. My specific field of interest for academic study is ethics and phenomenology. My undergraduate thesis, On Humility, was a phenomenological theory of knowledge in which I propose that the way to be knowledgeable is to have an epistemically humble demeanour. In working on this project I increasingly found that my epistemological project was also inseparably an ethical one. I want to continue this line of research. Drawing on the works of philosophers such as Heidegger and Levinas, I want to explore the idea that the constitution of our phenomenal world is ultimately ethical. I think that we fundamentally experience the world as a normative question, and that our essential nature lies in perceiving and answering the question. Public policy is thoroughly intertwined with my philosophical interests, because work on policy is first and foremost an ethical project. I am inclined to think that all research is ultimately ethical in nature, but public policy is one of the fewer fields that studies ethics explicitly. The project of public policy, informed by many other fields of research, is to determine both how we think the world should be and how to change it to match our vision. I am interested in public policy because I have an ethical project, and I believe that I would be well served in a public policy program because of my philosophy and interdisciplinary background. In the end everything comes down to ethics. We must all struggle with the question of what we should do with our lives. I think that one of the most fascinating aspects of the question is that the question itself can also be a subject of study. What is the question? Are there right answers? Can we answer the question for others? It is, in a sense, the ultimate question of human existence. I have researched many different programs, and I have concluded that the London School of Economics MSC in philosophy and public policy would be an excellent fit for me. The program will allow me to continue my research on ethics in an interdisciplinary environment, while also providing me with the practical skills and the theoretical background to excel in many potential careers.

The profession of philosophy, largely under the leadership of the American Philosophical Association, has taken steps which, together with a pattern of a significant number of faculty approaching retirement, have gradually moved the market toward equilibrium between supply and demand of PhDs. Although the job market remains stringent for candidates, it is also becoming more difficult for employers to hire their top choices. Institutions that aspire to offer an undergraduate major in philosophy will find themselves in a stronger position to recruit better teachers. The value of philosophy graduate programs must be understood differently. At least three points should be added to what has already been said about philosophy programs: that teaching is not the only activity for which advanced philosophy training can prepare a person; that, in part for reasons indicated above, advanced work in philosophy is important to various non-philosophers, both in the academic world and outside it; and that MA programs in philosophy can effectively serve certain people preparing for a non-academic profession, such as law or public service. We must also emphasize that for many universities, graduate programs in philosophy ""pay their own way” by generating more tuition revenue to the university than it costs to pay for departmental salaries, stipends, and overhead. It is true, however, that because of the writing-intensive nature of many courses in philosophy, the faculty-student ratio is even more important than in many other disciplines. There are at least two other reasons for the value of philosophy graduate programs. They are needed in order to prepare the next generation of the professoriate in both research and teaching. Moreover, in philosophy, the relation between teaching and research is especially close, and reducing or eliminating a graduate program is very likely (in some cases certain) to weaken undergraduate teaching. It would almost certainly hinder research that supports undergraduate teaching. Philosophy is unlike many fields in that the content even of beginning courses is greatly affected by the instructor’s research. Controversial issues like the relation between mind and body come into introductory courses, and what a teacher has to say about the issues depends heavily on a grasp of sophisticated argumentation that may underlie—indeed, may be necessary for giving—a clear and simple presentation, even though it may never enter the class discussion. This observation implies no negative attitude toward any other field; the point is to emphasize that philosophical research supports and is often necessary for good teaching in philosophy, even at the lower levels. 6. Measures of Programmatic Success
The following remarks suggest ways in which the success of a philosophy program can be measured. One such internal measure is provided by an institution’s outcomes assessment policies and procedures. (The American Philosophical Associations’s statement on outcomes assessment can be found at its website: www.apaonline.org.) In this section we address two different issues. We begin by expressing some skepticism about overly simplistic quantitative measures. We then turn to the issue of success from the student’s point of view, in particular, how a background in philosophy contributes to a student’s employment prospects. Enrollments and Grants: Cautionary Remarks
It would be a mistake to assess the value of a philosophy program by its enrollment figures. Few students entering college have had much exposure to philosophy. The same is true of such disciplines as economics, anthropology, and sociology, but students can quickly see the practical application of these disciplines to the study of human behavior. Philosophy can seem initially to be more esoteric, especially in light of its invisibility in most secondary school curriculums in the United States. With the exception of church-affiliated institutions, which often require multiple philosophy courses of all students, very few colleges or universities have any formal philosophy course requirement. Students thus quite often enroll in a philosophy course simply to fulfill an institutional requirement or to sample an intriguing elective. Moreover, philosophy can be a demanding discipline. In most colleges and universities the number of biology majors exceeds the number of physics majors. One should not infer from that phenomenon that physics is therefore less central than biology. For these reasons the importance of a philosophy program to an institution’s academic mission is not apt to be measured accurately by total course enrollments or total number of majors.

Thus we have completed the circuit and returned to the conceptions of the first portion of this book: such as the biological continuity of human impulses and instincts with natural energies; the dependence of the growth of mind upon participation in conjoint activities having a common purpose; the influence of the physical environment through the uses made of it in the social medium; the necessity of utilization of individual variations in desire and thinking for a progressively developing society; the essential unity of method and subject matter; the intrinsic continuity of ends and means; the recognition of mind as thinking which perceives and tests the meanings of behavior. These conceptions are consistent with the philosophy which sees intelligence to be the purposive reorganization, through action, of the material of experience; and they are inconsistent with each of the dualistic philosophies mentioned. 2. The Nature of Philosophy
Our further task is to extract and make explicit the idea of philosophy implicit in these considerations. We have already virtually described, though not defined, philosophy in terms of the problems with which it deals; and we have pointed out that these problems originate in the conflicts and difficulties of social life. The problems are such things as the relations of mind and matter; body and soul; humanity and physical nature; the individual and the social; theory - or knowing, and practice - or doing. The philosophical systems which formulate these problems record the main lineaments and difficulties of contemporary social practice. They bring to explicit consciousness what men have come to think, in virtue of the quality of their current experience, about nature, themselves, and the reality they conceive to include or to govern both. As we might expect, then, philosophy has generally been defined in ways which imply a certain totality, generality, and ultimateness of both subject matter and method. With respect to subject matter, philosophy is an attempt to comprehend - that is, to gather together the varied details of the world and of life into a single inclusive whole, which shall either be a unity, or, as in the dualistic systems, shall reduce the plural details to a small number of ultimate principles. On the side of the attitude of the philosopher and of those who accept his conclusions, there is the endeavor to attain as unified, consistent, and complete an outlook upon experience as is possible. This aspect is expressed in the word 'philosophy' - love of wisdom. Whenever philosophy has been taken seriously, it has always been assumed that it signified achieving a wisdom which would influence the conduct of life. Witness the fact that almost all ancient schools of philosophy were also organized ways of living, those who accepted their tenets being committed to certain distinctive modes of conduct; witness the intimate connection of philosophy with the theology of the Roman church in the middle ages, its frequent association with religious interests, and, at national crises, its association with political struggles. This direct and intimate connection of philosophy with an outlook upon life obviously differentiates philosophy from science. Particular facts and laws of science evidently influence conduct. They suggest things to do and not do, and provide means of execution. When science denotes not simply a report of the particular facts discovered about the world but a general attitude toward it - as distinct from special things to do - it merges into philosophy. For an underlying disposition represents an attitude not to this and that thing nor even to the aggregate of known things, but to the considerations which govern conduct. Hence philosophy cannot be defined simply from the side of subject matter. For this reason, the definition of such conceptions as generality, totality, and ultimateness is most readily reached from the side of the disposition toward the world which they connote. In any literal and quantitative sense, these terms do not apply to the subject matter of knowledge, for completeness and finality are out of the question. The very nature of experience as an ongoing, changing process forbids. In a less rigid sense, they apply to science rather than to philosophy. For obviously it is to mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, anthropology, history, etc. that we must go, not to philosophy, to find out the facts of the world. It is for the sciences to say what generalizations are tenable about the world and what they specifically are. But when we ask what sort of permanent disposition of action toward the world the scientific disclosures exact of us we are raising a philosophic question.

Personal philosophy statements can be fantastic in helping you focus on your goals and determining the steps necessary to achieve them. Developing a personal philosophy is an invaluable exercise that allows you to understand yourself better – both professionally and personally. You can create a roadmap to guide your actions and decisions by reflecting on your beliefs, values, and priorities. This article guides us into what personal philosophy entails and how to craft a great one. Meaning of “Personal Philosophy”
All the world’s greatest humanitarians, gurus, faiths, and charities have one. But what exactly is one’s philosophy, and how can it serve one? One’s philosophy encompasses all that a person values, believes in, and is motivated to live by. Its goal is to serve as a guidepost for your daily decisions and help you live according to your principles. Ultimately, your goals drive whatever endeavor you undertake or inspire you to pursue any specific action. How to Craft Great Personal Philosophy Statements
Personal worldviews change with a person’s development, education, and experience. As you go through life, you will always get a more nuanced view of the world and a simpler philosophy to guide your actions. So, without further ado, let’s get into some pointers to get you rolling. 1. Enhance Your Sense of Individuality
The first step in becoming who you want to be is accepting who you now are. Take a personality test or ask your friends about your strengths and weaknesses and what motivates you. Maintaining focus might be aided by writing down your ideas in a journal. Some people find that having a personal philosophy helps them remember who they are and what they’re capable of. You could be on a voyage of self-discovery, learning things about yourself that you didn’t know previously. Your philosophy statement can be improved by focusing on its intended purpose. 2. Determine Your Ideal Self and Stick to It
People have different goals in life; some aim for grandeur, while others want to be left alone in peace. I’m curious as to your ultimate goal(s). Possibly, you know roughly what it is you want to do, but you need help figuring out how to get there. This is why it’s helpful to have your philosophy to use as a starting point. Answering the following questions will help you figure out what you want from this trip. When you think about your daily routine, what makes you most eager to get out of bed? - If you had to sum up your beliefs in one sentence, what would they be? - In what ways do you think it’s necessary to uphold specific values? - Which moral traits do you admire in other people? Your answers to these questions can serve as a roadmap for your life’s purpose. As such, the answers may shed light on how you envision your future self-relationship. 3. Create Your Statement of Philosophy
Look at your notes from these exercises. See if you can see any recurring themes in terms of the values and characteristics that emerged. This could be seen as a fundamental moral tenet of your character. It could be overt, such as altering your self-talk or your expectations for the future, or it could be more subtle. Using the information you’ve obtained, try writing your personal philosophy statement while keeping the factors we’ve just discussed in mind. Your guiding philosophy should be concise and to the point. Don’t worry if this isn’t how it comes out at first. Changes can always be made. Developing a philosophy of life is a lifelong endeavor, and your beliefs and values will evolve as you do. There is always something to take away from any situation, no matter how dire it may seem. To grow, you need to broaden your horizons and be more accepting of the change. Ultimately, you are the total of your experiences. So, keep your development active by taking advantage of opportunities to live and learn. 4. Extending One’s Worldview and Life-Learnings
Your quest to formulate a guiding philosophy has resulted in your actively seeking out those experiences that get you closer to realizing your goals. Consider engaging in some of these pursuits to help shape your unique philosophy. 5. Take in Some Literary Works
Both fictional and nonfictional books can teach you about the world, yourself, and your passions.

Now, that does not mean that this training option has no value, on the contrary. Studying philosophy means learning skills that will hardly be developed in other disciplines. And is that There are plenty of reasons to study philosophy , shortly we learn about the nature of this source of knowledge. In the following lines we will see the most remarkable. - Related article: ""How are Psychology and Philosophy alike?"" Why study philosophy? This is a selection of those strengths that philosophy offers to those people who decide to learn from it. They are not ordered according to a certain criterion, but you can order them in your head, highlighting those that most appeal to you. If you\'re wondering why study philosophy , it will be very useful. 1. Offers a better scientific knowledge\nScience is a type of knowledge-gathering method that has proven to be incredibly valuable for centuries. Now, in practice, knowledge of science does not always imply interpreting the data that your research methods offer us. And is that many times we believe that scientific information is given by nature and convey an obvious meaning to anyone who knows, but this is not so. The philosophy of science it allows us to know if certain interpretations of data are adequate or not, if the research methods used allow us to draw the conclusions we want, or even if the hypotheses from which we start are defective. Thus, the training in philosophy is an excellent complement for science-based careers, on the one hand, and also allow for carving out a career as consultant science philosophers that can guide teams of researchers to review the approaches of their studies. 2. It is suitable for curious minds\nPhilosophy is the formative career par excellence for curious people, interested in the big questions about life and about existence . For example: what do we live for? What can we know? What exists and what does not? How should we behave to be good? In practice, the amount of questions of this type that philosophers can come to think is infinite and, although they do not usually reach conclusions that completely satisfy their initial curiosity, the hunger to know more and more leads them to organize their ideas in an increasingly sophisticated way . - Maybe you\'re interested: ""123 wise phrases to reflect on life""\n3. It allows to develop constructive criticisms\nThe world moves more and more by the logic imposed by the market, and that is why it is good to maintain a perspoective distance from this system and raise criticisms of those relations and trade dynamics from which it is so difficult to escape. Philosophy was born just for this: to question the most widespread beliefs, those that dominate our minds so much that we do not even consider them beliefs, but absolute truths. In this way, studying philosophy provides a rational counterpoint that makes it possible to have a different mentality, able to detect anomalies where other people can not, and that therefore makes social change possible. - Maybe it interests you: ""Are we rational or emotional beings?"" 4. It can be applied to one\'s life\nMany of the questions posed by philosophy have personal implications. For example, the existential crisis is not the same if you already have an experience in this field , and the same happens with doubts about how to act correctly and what kind of behaviors should be avoided. In other words, philosophical activity does not take place outside personal life; They usually merge into one thing. 5. It helps us to reinterpret the world\nPhilosophy is not exactly a form of therapy, but it does allow you to reach stimulating reflections on their own experiences, the world, personal relationships and everything that surrounds us. So, it makes it easier for us to find alternative ways of interpretation, those that satisfy us more and allow us to be happy. In the end, given that we can never have a totally objective vision of reality, it is better to direct our subjectivity towards what brings us closer to happiness and well-being. 6. It allows detecting manipulation attempts\nThe analysis of discourses is one of the areas in which philosophy is most useful.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:81d92461-8427-44b0-89b9-d5f483d5f171>']}, {'passage': '- Inductive reasoning is a method of logical thinking wherein broad generalizations and theories are derived from specific examples and observations. - Deductive reasoning, on the other hand, is opposite of inductive reasoning.

Why Do We Study Philosophy? Philosophy in life is extremely important. Why? It is because philosophy is like a way of life. It is a way of thinking, understanding, and gaining wisdom about human life, the reality, and the world. All of us are taught about philosophy at school because it is important to study about philosophy as we grow and become adults and as we fully embrace the reality of life. Here are 10 reasons why we study philosophy:\n1) To become a person of our own\nWith philosophy, we are able to think and become a person of our own. It enables us to not become just a “yes person”, who does not know how to think and decide for himself / herself. It gives us the ability to think critically, especially in real life situations. With this, philosophy also takes courage to be independent and decide for the self. 2) To get ready and succeed in various fields of expertise and careers\nWhen we study philosophy, we develop many essential skills such as reading, writing, speaking, reasoning, thinking, learning, adapting, communicating, and organizing. Now, these skills are very important in the real world, especially at the workplace where we need to perform and excel. Without these skills, we will be forever stuck and dependent on our families, especially our parents. 3) To realize your own understanding of what success is\nSuccess varies in different people and through philosophy, you will be able to realize and discover the meaning of success to you. Philosophy encourages you to think deeply, confront yourself, and know the answers, especially when it comes to questions about values, success, and fulfillment. 4) To be able to get great scores in standardized exams\nPhilosophy centers on critical, analytical, and logical thinking. Therefore, philosophy helps us figure out the correct answers in standardized tests like LSAT, GRE, MCAT, and GMAT. It is because these standardized exams are filled with philosophical questions and problems. 5) To grow and become a well informed citizen\nBeing an informed citizen does not only mean watching or reading the news everyday or surfing the web every hour. Being a well informed citizen means that beyond all the information overload that we are bombarded with everyday, we are able to think critically and behave according to what and why we know. 6) To have the potential to earn higher income\nPhilosophy stimulates the mind like no other field of study. This is the reason why so-called philosophers are very intelligent people full of wisdom. Now, when we study philosophy, we are able to develop our knowledge and wisdom to prepare for the real world of working and competition. We could have the potential to earn higher income through our learnings from philosophy. 7) To gain wisdom about ethical principles and their practice in real life\nThrough philosophy, we are able to learn about ethics, life, family, work, and social principles. With these ethical principles, we can be able to think and act ethically to various types of discussions, arguments, and situations. 8) To become a valuable and effective communicator\nPhilosophy teaches us the value of communication for personal and societal growth. When we study philosophy, our communication skills are also developed and enhanced. This further enables us to become excellent communicators who express our ideas, opinions, and theories effectively and intelligently. 9) To be able to determine our chosen path\nAnalytical thinking allows us to reflect on our deepest needs, desire, and passion. Philosophy helps us become analytical thinkers who are capable to know the best career path for ourselves so that we will not be wasting our time with the wrong choice or decision. 10) To get ready for a possible career in law\nSome of us want to partake in the world of law by becoming lawyers or attorneys.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:5d930711-9b1f-42e7-afd1-08291e098a07>']}, {'passage': 'Why Study Philosophy?Page address: https://www.mnsu.edu/philosophy/whystudy.html\nThe great virtue of philosophy is that it teaches not what to think, but how to think. It is the study of meaning, of the principles underlying conduct, thought and knowledge. The skills it hones are the ability to think critically and creatively, to question orthodoxies, and to express ideas clearly. While only a small proportion of philosophy majors go on to become professional philosophers, they flourish in a surprisingly diverse range of career fields. Philosophy has always been excellent training for the law, but it is equally useful for computer scientists. Philosophy majors have the highest acceptance rate to US medical schools, compared with all other majors. And more and more businesses recognize the valuable skills that philosophy majors bring to the workplace. Studying philosophy helps one become a truly independent thinker. And that is the ultimate transferable job skill.

Philosophy majors address the fundamental questions by developing foundational cognitive skills. They learn to question the things most people take for granted and they learn how to go about pursuing the answers to those questions. In the words of a 1998 editorial from the Times of London, ""The great virtue of philosophy is that it teaches not what to think, but how to think."" Because of this, a philosophical education is a valuable foundation for just about any career, and just about any sort of life. Many philosophy majors go into business (investment banking is a popular option). Many others go into law (including Justices Stephen Breyer and David Souter of the US Supreme Court). Some become novelists (Philip K. Dick, David Foster Wallace, Pearl S. Buck), artists (Robert Motherwell, Barnett Newman), film critics (Pauline Kael, Gene Siskel) or entertainers (Harrison Ford, David Duchovny, Steve Martin, Bruce Lee). Some become doctors, or study ethics and serve on advisory boards to hospitals. Some go into politics (Robert McNamara, William Bennett, Jerry Brown, Bill Clinton). Many teach: some in the public school system, others at the university level. And some,like Martin Luther King, fundamentally change the world we live in. The ancient Greek philosopher Socrates said, ""the unexamined life is not worth living."" Perhaps living an unexamined life is the only thing a person with a degree in philosophy cannot do.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:e16035d4-733b-4c73-bedf-1554a5b3cdb0>']}, {'passage': 'If any of my readers have any experience applying to graduate schools, I’m looking for advice and feedback on my statement of purpose. Highlighted sections are areas that I think may need some work. One of the things that I believe most firmly is that the world would benefit from having more philosophy. I am a philosophy student, and philosophy is an integral part of my life. I write a philosophy blog, I read philosophy books, and I attend philosophy discussion groups. It’s most pervasive influence however is that it has become the lens through which I view life. For though philosophy is, in a sense, in the metaphorical lens manufacturing business, I think in many ways the main benefit of philosophy is that you get a feel for the nature of the lenses themselves. To a certain extent philosophy helps us get outside of ourselves; something which I believe is invaluable, not just in academic study but also in our personal lives. I want philosophy to be my life’s work, but by this I do not just mean that I want to study philosophy academically – I am also interested in cultivating the philosophical mindset in society and government. I think the factor that has played the biggest role in my philosophical development is my interdisciplinary education at Quest University Canada. The philosophical courses that I took were excellent, but I think I got far more out of them then I otherwise would because they were situated in a broader context. My understanding of freewill was shaped by Kant and Dostoyevsky, but also by studies in molecular biology. My understanding of human nature was informed by Heidegger and evolutionary psychology. To learn about politics I’ve studied Plato, and I’ve also studied governmental systems and modern media theory. I have found that all of my studies’ have been mutually supportive, and that the most valuable contribution of philosophy is the critical mindset that it fosters. My opinion of the value of this mindset was reinforced to m by my experience working as a peer tutor at Quest. I edited papers from a wide variety of fields, including economics, ecology, biology, and many others. What I continuously found was that clarity of thought was the essential differentiating factor between good and bad papers, and that often the best way to help the other student was to try to draw them into a critical analysis of their own thoughts. My specific field of interest for academic study is ethics and phenomenology. My undergraduate thesis, On Humility, was a phenomenological theory of knowledge in which I propose that the way to be knowledgeable is to have an epistemically humble demeanour. In working on this project I increasingly found that my epistemological project was also inseparably an ethical one. I want to continue this line of research. Drawing on the works of philosophers such as Heidegger and Levinas, I want to explore the idea that the constitution of our phenomenal world is ultimately ethical. I think that we fundamentally experience the world as a normative question, and that our essential nature lies in perceiving and answering the question. Public policy is thoroughly intertwined with my philosophical interests, because work on policy is first and foremost an ethical project. I am inclined to think that all research is ultimately ethical in nature, but public policy is one of the fewer fields that studies ethics explicitly. The project of public policy, informed by many other fields of research, is to determine both how we think the world should be and how to change it to match our vision. I am interested in public policy because I have an ethical project, and I believe that I would be well served in a public policy program because of my philosophy and interdisciplinary background. In the end everything comes down to ethics. We must all struggle with the question of what we should do with our lives. I think that one of the most fascinating aspects of the question is that the question itself can also be a subject of study. What is the question? Are there right answers? Can we answer the question for others? It is, in a sense, the ultimate question of human existence. I have researched many different programs, and I have concluded that the London School of Economics MSC in philosophy and public policy would be an excellent fit for me. The program will allow me to continue my research on ethics in an interdisciplinary environment, while also providing me with the practical skills and the theoretical background to excel in many potential careers.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:10fc25c4-382f-4798-a7a5-7c19eac61f05>']}, {'passage': ""or: Descartes says that Q.

Although the job market remains stringent for candidates, it is also becoming more difficult for employers to hire their top choices. Institutions that aspire to offer an undergraduate major in philosophy will find themselves in a stronger position to recruit better teachers. The value of philosophy graduate programs must be understood differently. At least three points should be added to what has already been said about philosophy programs: that teaching is not the only activity for which advanced philosophy training can prepare a person; that, in part for reasons indicated above, advanced work in philosophy is important to various non-philosophers, both in the academic world and outside it; and that MA programs in philosophy can effectively serve certain people preparing for a non-academic profession, such as law or public service. We must also emphasize that for many universities, graduate programs in philosophy ""pay their own way” by generating more tuition revenue to the university than it costs to pay for departmental salaries, stipends, and overhead. It is true, however, that because of the writing-intensive nature of many courses in philosophy, the faculty-student ratio is even more important than in many other disciplines. There are at least two other reasons for the value of philosophy graduate programs. They are needed in order to prepare the next generation of the professoriate in both research and teaching. Moreover, in philosophy, the relation between teaching and research is especially close, and reducing or eliminating a graduate program is very likely (in some cases certain) to weaken undergraduate teaching. It would almost certainly hinder research that supports undergraduate teaching. Philosophy is unlike many fields in that the content even of beginning courses is greatly affected by the instructor’s research. Controversial issues like the relation between mind and body come into introductory courses, and what a teacher has to say about the issues depends heavily on a grasp of sophisticated argumentation that may underlie—indeed, may be necessary for giving—a clear and simple presentation, even though it may never enter the class discussion. This observation implies no negative attitude toward any other field; the point is to emphasize that philosophical research supports and is often necessary for good teaching in philosophy, even at the lower levels. 6. Measures of Programmatic Success\nThe following remarks suggest ways in which the success of a philosophy program can be measured. One such internal measure is provided by an institution’s outcomes assessment policies and procedures. (The American Philosophical Associations’s statement on outcomes assessment can be found at its website: www.apaonline.org.) In this section we address two different issues. We begin by expressing some skepticism about overly simplistic quantitative measures. We then turn to the issue of success from the student’s point of view, in particular, how a background in philosophy contributes to a student’s employment prospects. Enrollments and Grants: Cautionary Remarks\nIt would be a mistake to assess the value of a philosophy program by its enrollment figures. Few students entering college have had much exposure to philosophy. The same is true of such disciplines as economics, anthropology, and sociology, but students can quickly see the practical application of these disciplines to the study of human behavior. Philosophy can seem initially to be more esoteric, especially in light of its invisibility in most secondary school curriculums in the United States. With the exception of church-affiliated institutions, which often require multiple philosophy courses of all students, very few colleges or universities have any formal philosophy course requirement. Students thus quite often enroll in a philosophy course simply to fulfill an institutional requirement or to sample an intriguing elective. Moreover, philosophy can be a demanding discipline. In most colleges and universities the number of biology majors exceeds the number of physics majors. One should not infer from that phenomenon that physics is therefore less central than biology. For these reasons the importance of a philosophy program to an institution’s academic mission is not apt to be measured accurately by total course enrollments or total number of majors.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:ea680cee-f35b-4066-8bde-6c41186c4d9b>']}, {'passage': ""Thus we have completed the circuit and returned to the conceptions of the first portion of this book: such as the biological continuity of human impulses and instincts with natural energies; the dependence of the growth of mind upon participation in conjoint activities having a common purpose; the influence of the physical environment through the uses made of it in the social medium; the necessity of utilization of individual variations in desire and thinking for a progressively developing society; the essential unity of method and subject matter; the intrinsic continuity of ends and means; the recognition of mind as thinking which perceives and tests the meanings of behavior. These conceptions are consistent with the philosophy which sees intelligence to be the purposive reorganization, through action, of the material of experience; and they are inconsistent with each of the dualistic philosophies mentioned. 2. The Nature of Philosophy\nOur further task is to extract and make explicit the idea of philosophy implicit in these considerations. We have already virtually described, though not defined, philosophy in terms of the problems with which it deals; and we have pointed out that these problems originate in the conflicts and difficulties of social life. The problems are such things as the relations of mind and matter; body and soul; humanity and physical nature; the individual and the social; theory - or knowing, and practice - or doing. The philosophical systems which formulate these problems record the main lineaments and difficulties of contemporary social practice. They bring to explicit consciousness what men have come to think, in virtue of the quality of their current experience, about nature, themselves, and the reality they conceive to include or to govern both. As we might expect, then, philosophy has generally been defined in ways which imply a certain totality, generality, and ultimateness of both subject matter and method. With respect to subject matter, philosophy is an attempt to comprehend - that is, to gather together the varied details of the world and of life into a single inclusive whole, which shall either be a unity, or, as in the dualistic systems, shall reduce the plural details to a small number of ultimate principles. On the side of the attitude of the philosopher and of those who accept his conclusions, there is the endeavor to attain as unified, consistent, and complete an outlook upon experience as is possible. This aspect is expressed in the word 'philosophy' - love of wisdom. Whenever philosophy has been taken seriously, it has always been assumed that it signified achieving a wisdom which would influence the conduct of life. Witness the fact that almost all ancient schools of philosophy were also organized ways of living, those who accepted their tenets being committed to certain distinctive modes of conduct; witness the intimate connection of philosophy with the theology of the Roman church in the middle ages, its frequent association with religious interests, and, at national crises, its association with political struggles. This direct and intimate connection of philosophy with an outlook upon life obviously differentiates philosophy from science. Particular facts and laws of science evidently influence conduct. They suggest things to do and not do, and provide means of execution. When science denotes not simply a report of the particular facts discovered about the world but a general attitude toward it - as distinct from special things to do - it merges into philosophy. For an underlying disposition represents an attitude not to this and that thing nor even to the aggregate of known things, but to the considerations which govern conduct. Hence philosophy cannot be defined simply from the side of subject matter. For this reason, the definition of such conceptions as generality, totality, and ultimateness is most readily reached from the side of the disposition toward the world which they connote. In any literal and quantitative sense, these terms do not apply to the subject matter of knowledge, for completeness and finality are out of the question. The very nature of experience as an ongoing, changing process forbids. In a less rigid sense, they apply to science rather than to philosophy. For obviously it is to mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, anthropology, history, etc. that we must go, not to philosophy, to find out the facts of the world. It is for the sciences to say what generalizations are tenable about the world and what they specifically are. But when we ask what sort of permanent disposition of action toward the world the scientific disclosures exact of us we are raising a philosophic question."", 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:83a754ea-6d83-4f74-af5b-10156a6bed1b>']}, {'passage': 'Personal philosophy statements can be fantastic in helping you focus on your goals and determining the steps necessary to achieve them. Developing a personal philosophy is an invaluable exercise that allows you to understand yourself better – both professionally and personally. You can create a roadmap to guide your actions and decisions by reflecting on your beliefs, values, and priorities. This article guides us into what personal philosophy entails and how to craft a great one. Meaning of “Personal Philosophy”\nAll the world’s greatest humanitarians, gurus, faiths, and charities have one. But what exactly is one’s philosophy, and how can it serve one? One’s philosophy encompasses all that a person values, believes in, and is motivated to live by. Its goal is to serve as a guidepost for your daily decisions and help you live according to your principles. Ultimately, your goals drive whatever endeavor you undertake or inspire you to pursue any specific action. How to Craft Great Personal Philosophy Statements\nPersonal worldviews change with a person’s development, education, and experience. As you go through life, you will always get a more nuanced view of the world and a simpler philosophy to guide your actions. So, without further ado, let’s get into some pointers to get you rolling. 1. Enhance Your Sense of Individuality\nThe first step in becoming who you want to be is accepting who you now are. Take a personality test or ask your friends about your strengths and weaknesses and what motivates you. Maintaining focus might be aided by writing down your ideas in a journal. Some people find that having a personal philosophy helps them remember who they are and what they’re capable of. You could be on a voyage of self-discovery, learning things about yourself that you didn’t know previously. Your philosophy statement can be improved by focusing on its intended purpose. 2. Determine Your Ideal Self and Stick to It\nPeople have different goals in life; some aim for grandeur, while others want to be left alone in peace. I’m curious as to your ultimate goal(s). Possibly, you know roughly what it is you want to do, but you need help figuring out how to get there. This is why it’s helpful to have your philosophy to use as a starting point. Answering the following questions will help you figure out what you want from this trip. When you think about your daily routine, what makes you most eager to get out of bed? - If you had to sum up your beliefs in one sentence, what would they be? - In what ways do you think it’s necessary to uphold specific values? - Which moral traits do you admire in other people? Your answers to these questions can serve as a roadmap for your life’s purpose. As such, the answers may shed light on how you envision your future self-relationship. 3. Create Your Statement of Philosophy\nLook at your notes from these exercises. See if you can see any recurring themes in terms of the values and characteristics that emerged. This could be seen as a fundamental moral tenet of your character. It could be overt, such as altering your self-talk or your expectations for the future, or it could be more subtle. Using the information you’ve obtained, try writing your personal philosophy statement while keeping the factors we’ve just discussed in mind. Your guiding philosophy should be concise and to the point. Don’t worry if this isn’t how it comes out at first. Changes can always be made. Developing a philosophy of life is a lifelong endeavor, and your beliefs and values will evolve as you do. There is always something to take away from any situation, no matter how dire it may seem. To grow, you need to broaden your horizons and be more accepting of the change. Ultimately, you are the total of your experiences. So, keep your development active by taking advantage of opportunities to live and learn. 4. Extending One’s Worldview and Life-Learnings\nYour quest to formulate a guiding philosophy has resulted in your actively seeking out those experiences that get you closer to realizing your goals. Consider engaging in some of these pursuits to help shape your unique philosophy. 5. Take in Some Literary Works\nBoth fictional and nonfictional books can teach you about the world, yourself, and your passions.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:e6c44055-a58b-47b8-a5a0-860c2ce13122>']}, {'passage': ""Philosophy makes me think philosophy courses give you more than just knowledge of the world they give you a deep understanding of how the my philosophy senior thesis was not only the best part of my lehigh experience, but it has helped me tremendously throughout law school and my life.

                ""text"": ""What is philosophy? Essay\nWhat is philosophy? As complex as the modern world has become, it seems unlikely that most of what surrounds us is actually the result of the ancient practice of philosophy. Everything from the structure of democratic governments to due process of law, from a physician\u2019s Hippocratic Oath to computer software, has its roots in philosophy. Philosophy is an academic discipline that exercises reason and logic in an attempt to understand reality and answer fundamental questions about knowledge, life, morality and human nature. The ancient Greeks, who were among the first to practice philosophy, coined the term, which means \u201clove of wisdom. \u201d\nThose who study philosophy are called philosophers. Through the ages, philosophers have sought to answer such questions as, what is the meaning and purpose of life? How do we know what we know? Does God exist? What does it mean to possess consciousness? And, what is the value of morals? Nowadays usually such questions posed in a moment of quiet restlessness, at midnight, when there is no longer anything to ask. This is all that we ask for in order to make an opinion for ourselves, like a sort of \u201cumbrella,\u201d which protects us from chaos. Before answering a question, the person thoroughly analyzes it to ensure it is clearly and properly defined. This helps narrow the path to the most precise answer. philosophy is the art of forming, inventing, and fabricating concepts. But the answer not only had to take note of the question, it had to determine its moment, its occasion and circumstances, its landscapes and personae, its conditions and unknowns. Simply, the time has come for us to ask what philosophy is. The object of philosophy is to create concepts that are always new. The philosopher is expert in concepts and in the lack of them. He knows which of them are not viable, which are arbitrary or inconsistent, which ones do not hold up for an instant. On the other hand, he also knows which are well formed and attest to a creation, however disturbing or dangerous it may be. The philosopher is the concept\u2019s friend; he is potentiality of the concept. That is, philosophy is not a simple art of forming, inventing, or fabricating concepts, because concepts are not necessarily forms, discoveries, or products. \u201d Plato said that Ideas must be contemplated, but first of all he had to create the concept of Idea. To determine the value of philosophy, we must first free our minds from the prejudices of what are wrongly called \u2018practical\u2019 men. The goods of the mind are at least as important as the goods of the body. The mind which has become accustomed to the freedom and impartiality of philosophic contemplation will preserve something of the same freedom and impartiality in the world of action and emotion. It will view its purposes and desires as parts of the whole, with the absence of insistence that results from seeing them as infinitesimal fragments in a world of which all the rest is unaffected by any one man\u2019s deeds. For example comparing the philosopher, the scientist, and the artist we can tell that they seem to return from the land of the dead. What the philosopher brings back from the chaos are variations that are still infinite but that have become inseparable on the absolute surfaces or in the absolute volumes that lay out o distinct ideas. Creation and self-positing mutually imply each other because what is truly created, from the living being to the work of art, thereby enjoys a self-positing of itself, or an autopoetic characteristic by which it is recognized. Whether philosophy is anything better than innocent but useless trifling, hair-splitting distinctions, and controversies on matters concerning which knowledge is impossible. We can at least see what philosophy is not: it is not contemplation, reflection, or communication. It is not contemplation, for contemplations are things themselves as seen in the creation of their specific concepts. It is not reflection, because no one needs philosophy to reflect on anything. It is thought that philosophy is being given a great deal by being turned into the art of reflection, but actually it loses everything. The value of philosophy is, in fact, to be sought largely in its very uncertainty."",

                ""text"": ""Another all time favorite fundamental philosophical question is \u201cWhat is just?\u201d Justice is blind, and only humans define justice by past experience through religion, emotions, struggles, and reasons. Justification is always changing and the people who justify what is right or wrong are imperfect homo sapiens who justice have never done wrong to them. In my opinion, those who know justice well are mostly in favor of freedom and equality for all, even if they have to sacrifice their life for it. For example, a group of rebels join together for a cause, and this cause is to kill the king that threatens their society with unequal rights and unusual punishments. This group disregards their consequences for killing the king, to liberate themselves. For this reason they were killed, but they have brought just into society and forever they will be remembered as those who die for a great cause. This still does not define justice enough to make its meaning universal through the world. In conclusion, philosophy is nothing more than thoughts and ideas that evolved through space and time with more and more human advancements. Philosophy is the fundamental questions that which cannot be answered from reality, but within the human mind. This idea presents philosophy as a solution to the universe\u2019s problems, for through philosophy we have advance thus far and we will continue to advance till we can advance no further. Once we reach our goals, then maybe there will be an end to human existence within the universe, and if there is no end and humans are trapped in an endless suffering in nature\u2019s circle of life, then philosophy has no reason for its existence."",

                ""text"": ""I\u2019ve been reading a lot of comments on articles about philosophy and science that seem to be seeking the worth of philosophy in whether or not it currently contributes anything substantive to the natural sciences. While I expect this from those who are aiming to show that philosophy is obsolete, I\u2019m puzzled by the many defenders of philosophy who also follow this path, thereby reifying the idea that science is the be-all and end-all of intellectual inquiry \u2013 essentially saying that if a discipline is a science, it\u2019s good, and if it\u2019s not, it\u2019s bad. But philosophy\u2019s contribution to science isn\u2019t that it helps us find answers to specific physical questions. Its contribution isn\u2019t that it performs scientific inquiry, its contribution is that scientific inquiry exists at all. Philosophy isn\u2019t worthwhile because it can do what science does, it\u2019s worthwhile because it gave us science. That doesn\u2019t mean, as many claim, that it\u2019s job is over. It continues to look for new ways of thinking about causality, about subjectivity, and about bridging interdisciplinary gaps. Philosophy also gave us theology, psychology, aesthetics, logic, music theory, and more, and all of these disciplines are hugely important because they can discover things that philosophy cannot. But these discoveries don\u2019t supplant philosophy, they actually make philosophy better. Instead of thinking of the value of academic disciplines as a continuum that starts out at \u201cfruitless\u201d and culminates in \u201cscience\u201d, I prefer to think in terms of an orchard. An orchard starts with good, fertile soil, full of possibilities. Some of these possibilities will be realized, and some will fail to find a legitimate seed, or even if they don\u2019t, they won\u2019t receive enough sunlight, good air, and water. But many will grow into trees which will someday bear nutritious and delicious fruit. And the fruit will be what matters, because it is what is useful, and we will value the trees because they bear the fruit, and the sun and the air and the water because those are elements we can see and feel and understand easily. But that doesn\u2019t mean we can forget the soil, because it\u2019s also important. We cannot just grow trees and say that the soil has done its job and so we no longer need it. We cannot do away with the soil and expect the trees to still bear fruit. Luckily, the soil can be nourished, either by external care or by its own offspring, reincorporating fallen fruit that failed to be productive, or by trying something new (crop rotation is the metaphor here). Philosophy can gather false-starts in science and psychology and other disciplines, and evaluate where they went wrong, taking their assumptions and reorganizing them in case there\u2019s something to salvage, some remaining possibility, or if there\u2019s potentially some trouble ahead for other fruit which seems \u2013 so far \u2013 to be safe and sound. The point is that no one begrudges the soil for not producing fruit without the tree. The tree, the fruit, the sun, the water, the soil, the air, the seeds \u2013 they all work in a relationship. We don\u2019t need to pick one at the expense of the other. Why then do we feel the need to pit science and philosophy against each other? Yes, philosophy by itself teams with sometimes fruitless unrealized possibility (and I so love this possibility), but science that neglects philosophy will eventually reach its limits. It\u2019s only when we confuse the goals of the two that one or both will undoubtedly fail, but it\u2019s not a necessary confusion. I don\u2019t need philosophy to beat science at its own game, and no, I don\u2019t know what philosophy will contribute next. I\u2019m ok with that. I think it\u2019s enough to try and keep the soil nourished and full of possibility, supporting other disciplines in their theoretical approaches and assumptions, and hopefully \u2013 if we can find just the right seeds \u2013 giving rise to new ones too."",

The FMCSA is looking for comments on the training, qualification and safety issues that should be considered for this second pilot program. It is specifically looking for available safety data on 18- to 20-year-old drivers who operate commercial vehicles in intrastate commerce, where drivers this age are currently allowed to operate. This is an effort years in the making. The FMCSA said it was petitioned to consider this change as far back as October 2, 2000 when the Truckload Carriers Association asked the agency to consider such a pilot. The FMCSA held a public comment period the next year and received 1,600 comments, with 90% of them opposed to the idea on the basis younger drivers lack the maturity for the job, the agency explained in its Federal Register posting. ""None explained how interstate drivers under 21 would diminish safety when most States have concluded that intrastate drivers under 21 do not do so,"" FMCSA said of the 2001 comments. ""Very few truck drivers and motor carriers commented, but most of them also opposed the pilot program."" The petition was denied in 2003.

Age: You must be at least 18 years old to obtain a Class A CDL, but you cannot engage in interstate commerce until you are at least 21 years old. 2. Driver's License: You must have a valid driver's license and a good driving record. 3. Medical Certification: You must provide a valid medical certificate that meets the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) medical standards. 4. Knowledge Tests: You must pass the general knowledge test and any applicable endorsement tests, such as air brakes and combination vehicles. 5. Commercial Learner's Permit (CLP): You must obtain a Commercial Learner's Permit (CLP) by passing the knowledge tests. 6. Training: You must complete behind-the-wheel training with a qualified instructor or employer, and practice driving with your CLP under the supervision of a licensed CDL holder. 7. Skills Test: You must pass a three-part skills test that includes pre-trip inspection, basic control skills, and an on-road driving test. 8. Fees: You must pay the required fees to obtain your Class A CDL license. It is important to note that additional requirements may apply depending on the type of commercial vehicle you plan to operate, such as endorsements for hazardous materials or passenger transport. It is important to note that some employers may have additional age requirements for their drivers, so it is important to check with potential employers to determine their specific hiring criteria. In Oregon, the following endorsements are available for Class A CDL holders:
1. T - Double/Triple Trailers: To pull double or triple trailers. 2. P - Passenger: To transport passengers in a commercial vehicle. 3. N - Tank Vehicle: To transport liquids or gases in bulk containers. 4. H - Hazardous Materials: To transport hazardous materials as defined by federal regulations. 5. X - Combination of Tank Vehicle and Hazardous Materials: To transport both hazardous materials and liquids or gases in bulk containers. If you plan to operate a commercial vehicle that requires any of these endorsements, you will need to pass additional knowledge tests and meet other requirements, such as background checks and fingerprinting. 1. Pre-Trip Vehicle Inspection: You will be asked to perform a thorough inspection of your vehicle to ensure that it is safe to operate. This includes checking the brakes, steering, lights, tires, and other components. 2. Basic Vehicle Control: You will be asked to demonstrate your ability to control your vehicle in a variety of situations, such as backing up, turning, and maneuvering through a course. 3. On-Road Driving: You will be asked to drive your vehicle on public roads while demonstrating your ability to follow traffic laws, merge safely onto highways, change lanes, and make turns. Each part of the test is designed to evaluate your knowledge and skills related to operating a commercial vehicle safely and effectively. It is important to practice and prepare for the test by studying the Oregon Commercial Driver Manual and getting hands-on experience with a qualified instructor or mentor. 1. Air Brake Restriction: If you have not passed the air brake knowledge test and skills test, you will have an ""L"" restriction on your license, which means you are not authorized to drive a commercial vehicle with air brakes. 2. Intrastate Only Restriction: If you do not meet the federal medical requirements or do not self-certify to operate in interstate commerce, you will have an ""O"" restriction on your license, which means you are only authorized to operate commercial vehicles within Oregon. 3. Automatic Transmission Restriction: If you take your skills test in a vehicle with an automatic transmission, you will have an ""E"" restriction on your license, which means you are not authorized to drive a commercial vehicle with a manual transmission. 4. Other restrictions: Depending on your driving history or other factors, you may have additional restrictions on your license, such as a restriction that limits you to driving during daylight hours or prohibits you from driving certain types of vehicles. It is important to understand and comply with any restrictions or limitations on your CDL license to avoid penalties or other consequences. However, it's important to note that the skills test and the pre-trip inspection test must be taken in English. This is because the CDL skills test requires clear communication between the examiner and the driver, and the pre-trip inspection test involves identifying and describing various components of a commercial vehicle using standard English terminology.

Commercial driving license CDL refers to a driver’s license that is used to operate commercial vehicles without any trouble. It is necessary to have a commercial driving license for those who want to drive commercial vehicles or vehicles used for transportation. The CDL is used to operate heavy and large vehicles, vehicles to transport hazardous material, and other commercial vehicles. Commercial vehicles include trucks, buses, and trailers. Driving a commercial vehicle is a huge responsibility so a truck driver or a trailer driver must have a Commercial Truck License for smooth business operations. Types of Commercial Licenses
Commercial driving licenses include Class A, Class B, and Class C licenses. To get any of the mentioned licenses, you need to pass a test to showcase your driving knowledge, road sense, and specific driving skills. For few drivers, it is highly recommended to have a training from training school to avoid road conditions and accidents
Class A Commercial Driving License
Class A driving license is to operate any commercial vehicle with another vehicle like a trailer that weighs more than 26000 pounds. Drivers having a Class A driving license can drive tractor-trailers, 18-wheelers, semi or big rigs, a combination of trucks and trailers, livestock carriers, flatbeds, vehicles related to Class B and Class C, and tanker vehicles. Class B Commercial Driving License
Class B driving license is to operate any single commercial vehicle (not attached to a trailer) that weighs more than 26000 pounds. Drivers having Class B driving licenses can drive straight trucks, delivery trucks like furniture trucks, box trucks, large buses, tourist buses, school buses, dump trucks with small trailers. They can also drive Class C vehicles. Class C Commercial Driving License
Class B driving license is to operate any single commercial vehicle (not attached to a trailer) that weighs less than 26000 pounds. Drivers having Class C driving licenses can drive double trailers, triple trailers, passenger vans, buses, tanks, and other similar vehicles. How to Get a Commercial Driving License? Check for the minimum age requirement before you apply for the commercial driving license. The minimum age requirement varies from state to state. Some states allow applying for a commercial driving license between the ages of 18 to 21. However, some states require a minimum age of 21 years. A single state commercial driving license allows a driver to operate the commercial vehicle within the boundaries of the state of the residence of the drive. There are strict rules and guidelines to obtain a commercial driving license and each state has its regulations and requirements. To get a commercial driving license, you must pass a written knowledge test and a driving skills test, which is designed and conducted by the state itself. - Fulfill the minimum age requirement according to your residential state. - Think about the license type that you want to have. If you need a Class A or Class B driving license, you must complete driving training from an approved training provider or a training school. - Check for the application process and required documents you need to submit with your application. - Complete your application form. Attach all required documents and submit to the concerned office for further proceedings. - Submit your identity and social security number verifications as per the requirements by your state. - Show proof of your residence and proof of the state. - Plan your medical examination from an authorized doctor, laboratory, hospital, or clinic. Submit your complete medical examination report. Make sure to get a certificate that proves that the laboratory or hospital is certified to conduct a medical examination. - Pass the vision test to prove that you can see properly. - Pass a knowledge exam that will prove that you know the basics of driving and know the road signs and other important information. - Now wait for a few days and then schedule your driving test on the road. - Passing a pre-trip inspection is necessary. - Bring your commercial vehicle to pass the road skill test and driving test. - Once you have passed and cleared all exams and tests, pay the necessary fee to get your Commercial Driving License. - If you already have a driving license from one state and want to apply for a driving license of a second state, you must submit the driving record of at least 10 years along with your application.

These requirements apply to both interstate and intrastate operations whose drivers are subject to the commercial driver’s license requirements found in Part 383 of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. The drug and alcohol testing requirements are very extensive, as you will see on the following pages. For that reason, we would suggest that small carriers join a drug and alcohol testing program and/or consortium. Such programs/consortiums will usually provide all necessary materials and help to ensure compliance. |Table 3.1: REQUIRED TESTS FOR DRUGS & ALCOHOL|

Truck Driver Shortage Prompts Pilot Program to Test Teen Commercial Drivers on Public Roads
The trucking industry has become known for its aggressive lobbying tactics, and for supporting regulatory rollbacks and new rules that allow commercial trucking operators to increase profits at the expense of public safety. This includes recent amendments to drop testing of commercial drivers with conditions like sleep apnea (which makes them more likely to crash), and efforts to pass laws that increase vehicle weight limits, terminate certain Hours-of-Service requirements regarding mandatory driver rest breaks, and reduce the federal age limit for commercial drivers from 21 to 18. With a recent announcement from federal regulators, younger truckers may soon be a common site on our roads. This month, officials from the DOT’s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) announced that they are preparing to launch a pilot program that would test out teen commercial drivers on public roads. Here are few important details about what it involves:
- Under the FMCSA’s pilot program, drivers between 18 and 20 will be able to drive commercial trucks and vehicles across state lines. Currently, only drivers 21 and older can operate trucks for interstate commerce. - Only drivers who have military experience and training in certain occupational specialists will be allowed to participate in the program. - The pilot program will include policies that require young drivers to complete a 240-hour apprentice driving program where they may only drive with veteran CDL holders and may not exceed 65 mph. - The program is intended to roll out later this year. The announcement has received a great deal of attention, in part because proposed laws to reduce the federal commercial driver age limit have long been supported by the trucking industry since the start of a chronic shortage. In fact, reducing the age limit has been one of the industry’s top solutions for addressing the trucker shortage problem, which is expected to reach nearly 65,000 drivers this year. That’s equal to roughly one commercial tractor-trailer per every 12 cargo loads, the lowest ratio in 15 years. While it may seem like a reasonable solution to the commercial trucking operators and companies that want to keep up with a rising demand for transportation of consumer goods, the proposed age limit reduction has faced harsh scrutiny from public safety advocates who argue that it puts the public at risk while allowing major corporations to profit from cheap labor. Additionally, they cite statistics like those from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which show that teen drivers are approximately 3 times more likely to fatally crash than drivers who are 20 or older. In response to these arguments, proponents and the trucking industry have pointed to the safety apprentice driving policy requiring young drivers to first train with more experienced drivers. They also commonly argue that 18-year-olds are currently allowed to operate commercial vehicles, though within state borders, in many states across the country. Trucking Regulations & Public Safety
As a personal injury and workers’ compensation law firm that fights for victims across Chicago and the state of Illinois, our legal team at Leonard Law Group knows how crucially important trucking regulations are to protecting the public and ensuring commercial operators take the necessary steps to reduce risks of serious truck accidents. Over the years, we’ve represented many victims of truck accidents, including drivers of passenger vehicles hit by truckers and truck drivers themselves, and are well aware of the devastating and often life-altering damage these massive machines can cause. Because commercial trucks pose such overwhelming dangers on our roads, we know it is important for advocates, lawmakers, and the public to keep apprised of trucking industry efforts fueled by money and potential profits rather than any concern for public safety. Just because the status quo may allow teens to get behind the wheel of trucks in some states doesn’t mean it should be preserved and strengthened across the board. That’s what many safety advocates will continue to focus on as they track the new pilot program and prepare to fight efforts for implementing the regulatory change nationwide. Fighting for Truck Accident Victims
Although trucking regulations have been prone to change, there are still numerous laws that apply to trucking operators and drivers and make them responsible for taking appropriate safety measures.

Commercial Driver FAQs in Wisconsin
Earning your commercial driver's license (CDL) is quite a bit more involved than earning your regular driver's license. That's why DMV.ORG has compiled a list of some of the most frequently asked questions regarding commercial drivers in Wisconsin. I want to drive a truck and go over the road but I'm not 21 years old yet. Do I have to wait until I turn 21 years old to get my license? Not at all! You may apply for your CDL if you are 18 years old and as soon as you have completed your training and are ready to take the tests required for a commercial driver license. However, before you will be eligible to go over the road and drive outside of Wisconsin, you must be 21 years old. If you receive your CDL before then, you may drive intrastate (inside Wisconsin) until you do turn 21 years old. I'm in truck driving school. What equipment will I be able to drive once I have my commercial driver license? What you are allowed to drive depends on two things: the license class and which, if any, endorsements you have. Here's a breakdown:
- Class A: Allows you to drive any combination of vehicles with a combined GVWR of 26,001 lbs. or more, if the GVWR of the vehicle or vehicles being towed is in excess of 10,000 lbs. - Class B: Allows you to drive a single vehicle with a GVWR of 26,001 lbs. or more or any such vehicle with a trailer with a GVWR of no more than 10,000 lbs. - Class C: Allows you to drive any single vehicle, or combination of vehicles, that does not meet the definition of Class A or Class B, but is either designed to transport 16 passengers or more, including the driver, or is placarded for hazardous materials. If the equipment you want to drive is not listed in any of the above categories, then you will need to obtain an endorsement to add to your CDL. Here's a list of endorsement types, equipment, and cargo, along with the letter designation for the endorsement:
- Bulk liquid tankers (N)
- Doubles/Triples (T)
- Passenger buses (P)
- School buses (S)
- Hazmat cargo, regardless of vehicle size (H)
If you want to be licensed to drive equipment with air brakes, then you need a separate endorsement for that. You must take an additional knowledge test and the vehicle you supply for your road test must have air brakes in order to get your authorization. I just saw an ad for school bus drivers and I'd like to apply. I like kids, so I think I'd be good at this. Besides a basic CDL, what else do I need? As you know, you must have a Class A CDL, plus the separate ""S"" endorsement in order to be allowed to drive a school bus. The Commercial Driver Manual is the section of the commercial driver manual for school bus drivers. I've had a CDL for years and have driven over the road. I now have an opportunity to drive intrastate for one of the dairies. I can't remember if a tank with baffles requires an endorsement. Can you tell me? Yes, regardless of the internal safety equipment, driving a tanker will require a ""T"" endorsement on your CDL. I have a valid CDL from Minnesota, but my family just moved here to Wisconsin. Do I need to get a Wisconsin license, too? Actually, you will need to surrender your Minnesota CDL and apply for a Wisconsin CDL. According to Federal law, you may hold only one driver's license of any type, at any one time. You'll have 30 days in which to surrender your Minnesota license and apply for the transfer to a Wisconsin license. Do I need a CDL to drive a dump truck? Yes, if the vehicle is in the class of commercial vehicle, then you must obtain a CDL before you may drive it on public roads. The same is true for other construction equipment including cement mixers and other large vehicles. How about driving a water truck on a construction site? Does that require a CDL? It might surprise you to learn that if you drive any heavy equipment such as a water truck, rock truck, grader, or front loader, you do not need a CDL. This is because none of this type of equipment is ever driven over public roads. If the vehicle must be towed to the construction site, then it will not require a CDL in order to legally operate it.

If you want to enter the world of truck driving, then you should apply for a CDL or commercial driver’s license training. However, before you apply, make sure that you are ready to handle the job. Truck driving is not just for anyone; it is only for those who can endure the type of work situation that this job involves, such as long hours and extreme conditions behind the wheel. Instruction is to ensure that you are equipped with the proper skills in order to handle the job like an expert. In the end, it all goes back to really wanting the job and being ready to put in the time and effort required to become successful. There different types of CDL requirements depending on the type of class of license that you are applying for. This is especially for those who are seeking additional endorsements to their licenses. New standards requirements have been set in place in order to meet the growing demand for safety and efficiency in the driving capabilities of those involved in commercial activities. This means that what may have worked ten or twenty years ago may not be applicable for those who wish to work as commercial drivers today. You will also need to be updated about newer regulations from the DOT if you want a thorough discussion of these rules. Typically, those who want to work as a semi-truck driver will need to get a Class A driver’s license. The first thing that you have to possess in order to qualify for a Class A commercial driver’s license is to be at the required age. This varies from one state to another as there are states who allow 16 to 17 year olds to apply for an intrastate commercial driver’s license whereas there are others who require applicants to have a minimum age of 18. You must check your local DMV office or website in order to learn more about their age requirements. Next, you will have to apply for an instruction permit. In order to do so, you will have to submit several requirements: a current and active driver’s license, a CDL application form (Form 735-155) which is available at your local DMV office, IDs that show your legal name, proof of your US citizenship or legal status in the US, birth certificate, and your Social Security number. After or before you submit these requirements at the local DMV office, you will be required to undergo a DOT physical exam. The exam is conducted in order to determine your physical fitness for the demanding job of being a commercial driver. After this, you will be asked to pass a written test which shall be based on the DMV CDL manual. You can get a copy of this manual in your local DMV office. Study the manual well before you take the written exam. Once you pass the written exam, you will then be given an instruction permit which will allow you to drive a commercial vehicle as long as you are accompanied by a licensed individual. The permit will only be valid for a set period of time so make sure that you learn as much as you can during the period. The DMV will also require you to undergo a medical and visual exam right before or after you take the actual test depending on the rules in your state. This is to make sure that you do not have a medical condition which can affect your driving capacity. Before your permit expires, you should be able to take the actual or practical exam for a CDL. You will have to visit the DMV office in order to know how you will be able to take this. If you pass this driving test, you will then be given your commercial driver’s license after paying the required fees. Those who desire a Class B driver’s license will often be pursued by those wanting to drive a bus, dump truck, or other commercial vehicle. Where to find CDL Training
Today, you can find CDL schools in a variety of facilities and institutions. This is due to the fact that there is a large demand for truck drivers in the industry. Truck driving classes are being offered by community colleges, technical and vocational schools, as well as by private trucking companies who are looking for a steady supply of driver’s for their business. If you want to be sure that you are getting the best training possible, you can try searching for those which are accredited by national organizations or by the trucking industry. The training involves both theoretical teaching and practical sessions where you will be required to drive an actual truck. But before you enroll for these classes, you will be required to acquire an instruction permit first from your local DMV or BMV office so you can drive the truck. You also need to be specific about the type of commercial vehicle that you will be practicing on.

If you haven’t heard of the Drive Safe Act, you may be either shocked or pleased to learn that a bill has been filed that would authorize 18-21 year olds to drive 18-wheelers professionally on the interstate, whereas now they must be 21. In most states, drivers can get their automobile drivers’ license at the age of 16, but the federal law states you must be 21 to drive a truck professionally. If the Drive Safe Act becomes a law, that will change. The Proposed Drive Safe Act
On February 26, 2019, The Drive Safe Act bill was introduced that, if passed, states drivers from 18-21 years old will be allowed to drive trucks professionally across state lines. Right now, drivers under the age of 21 can be a professional truck driver, but must remain in their home state until they reach the age of 21. This bill was introduced to reduce the interstate commercial truck driving age to 18 nationally in an effort to address a truck driver shortage. Currently in the United States, there is a 51,000 truck driver shortage and appears to be on a continuing rise, unless something is done. “DRIVE” Safe Act stands for Developing Responsible Individuals for a Vibrant Economy. Because of the concern for interstate safety knowing that 18 year olds may be soon operating 18-wheelers, there are requirements that must be met. First of all, the drivers must log 240 hours of on-duty drive time in the presence of an experienced truck driver as part of their job training. Furthermore, the trucks being driven by the trainees must come equipped with approved safety technologies such as automatic “active breaking” systems and dashboard cameras. Once these requirements are satisfied, that driver(s) will then be eligible to drive the trucks, moving freight, across state lines without limitation. All in Favor Say Aye
There are varying opinions on the Drive Safe Act, but those who are in favor of it have their reasons. Supporters strongly believe it will improve the national truck driving shortage and thus, enhance the job economy by giving younger people more job opportunities in this field. Supporters, in response to highway safety concerns, claim with the outlined extensive training program and safety equipped trucks, that safety is not a concern. Their argument is that safety/training are the focus and not the age of the driver. All Opposed Say Nay
This bill has a lot of people shaking their heads wondering how severely this will affect public safety if passed by legislation. Despite what the followers state, those against this Bill claim that age is a factor and studies show that young drivers are more likely to be involved in fatal crashes than their older counterparts. Furthermore, those against this bill state that instead of solving the trucking shortage, they are simply endangering others on the interstate and only putting a Band-Aid on the problem. Their belief is that by putting younger people behind the wheels of 18-wheelers, it will only drive the wages downward due to the increased truck driver expansion pool of young people. Right now, by maintaining a smaller pool of people, the wages remain high and could even rise to a higher level. That is not a Band-Aid, but a solution in the eyes of those protesting this Bill. Nothing to date has been resolved with the Drive Safe Act, so the issue remains until legislation votes.

For few drivers, it is highly recommended to have a training from training school to avoid road conditions and accidents\nClass A Commercial Driving License\nClass A driving license is to operate any commercial vehicle with another vehicle like a trailer that weighs more than 26000 pounds. Drivers having a Class A driving license can drive tractor-trailers, 18-wheelers, semi or big rigs, a combination of trucks and trailers, livestock carriers, flatbeds, vehicles related to Class B and Class C, and tanker vehicles. Class B Commercial Driving License\nClass B driving license is to operate any single commercial vehicle (not attached to a trailer) that weighs more than 26000 pounds. Drivers having Class B driving licenses can drive straight trucks, delivery trucks like furniture trucks, box trucks, large buses, tourist buses, school buses, dump trucks with small trailers. They can also drive Class C vehicles. Class C Commercial Driving License\nClass B driving license is to operate any single commercial vehicle (not attached to a trailer) that weighs less than 26000 pounds. Drivers having Class C driving licenses can drive double trailers, triple trailers, passenger vans, buses, tanks, and other similar vehicles. How to Get a Commercial Driving License? Check for the minimum age requirement before you apply for the commercial driving license. The minimum age requirement varies from state to state. Some states allow applying for a commercial driving license between the ages of 18 to 21. However, some states require a minimum age of 21 years. A single state commercial driving license allows a driver to operate the commercial vehicle within the boundaries of the state of the residence of the drive. There are strict rules and guidelines to obtain a commercial driving license and each state has its regulations and requirements. To get a commercial driving license, you must pass a written knowledge test and a driving skills test, which is designed and conducted by the state itself. - Fulfill the minimum age requirement according to your residential state. - Think about the license type that you want to have. If you need a Class A or Class B driving license, you must complete driving training from an approved training provider or a training school. - Check for the application process and required documents you need to submit with your application. - Complete your application form. Attach all required documents and submit to the concerned office for further proceedings. - Submit your identity and social security number verifications as per the requirements by your state. - Show proof of your residence and proof of the state. - Plan your medical examination from an authorized doctor, laboratory, hospital, or clinic. Submit your complete medical examination report. Make sure to get a certificate that proves that the laboratory or hospital is certified to conduct a medical examination. - Pass the vision test to prove that you can see properly. - Pass a knowledge exam that will prove that you know the basics of driving and know the road signs and other important information. - Now wait for a few days and then schedule your driving test on the road. - Passing a pre-trip inspection is necessary. - Bring your commercial vehicle to pass the road skill test and driving test. - Once you have passed and cleared all exams and tests, pay the necessary fee to get your Commercial Driving License. - If you already have a driving license from one state and want to apply for a driving license of a second state, you must submit the driving record of at least 10 years along with your application.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:32ef2577-818f-4dfe-b8cc-8cc1fdc449d3>']}, {'passage': 'These requirements apply to both interstate and intrastate operations whose drivers are subject to the commercial driver’s license requirements found in Part 383 of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. The drug and alcohol testing requirements are very extensive, as you will see on the following pages.

This includes recent amendments to drop testing of commercial drivers with conditions like sleep apnea (which makes them more likely to crash), and efforts to pass laws that increase vehicle weight limits, terminate certain Hours-of-Service requirements regarding mandatory driver rest breaks, and reduce the federal age limit for commercial drivers from 21 to 18. With a recent announcement from federal regulators, younger truckers may soon be a common site on our roads. This month, officials from the DOT’s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) announced that they are preparing to launch a pilot program that would test out teen commercial drivers on public roads. Here are few important details about what it involves:\n- Under the FMCSA’s pilot program, drivers between 18 and 20 will be able to drive commercial trucks and vehicles across state lines. Currently, only drivers 21 and older can operate trucks for interstate commerce. - Only drivers who have military experience and training in certain occupational specialists will be allowed to participate in the program. - The pilot program will include policies that require young drivers to complete a 240-hour apprentice driving program where they may only drive with veteran CDL holders and may not exceed 65 mph. - The program is intended to roll out later this year. The announcement has received a great deal of attention, in part because proposed laws to reduce the federal commercial driver age limit have long been supported by the trucking industry since the start of a chronic shortage. In fact, reducing the age limit has been one of the industry’s top solutions for addressing the trucker shortage problem, which is expected to reach nearly 65,000 drivers this year. That’s equal to roughly one commercial tractor-trailer per every 12 cargo loads, the lowest ratio in 15 years. While it may seem like a reasonable solution to the commercial trucking operators and companies that want to keep up with a rising demand for transportation of consumer goods, the proposed age limit reduction has faced harsh scrutiny from public safety advocates who argue that it puts the public at risk while allowing major corporations to profit from cheap labor. Additionally, they cite statistics like those from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which show that teen drivers are approximately 3 times more likely to fatally crash than drivers who are 20 or older. In response to these arguments, proponents and the trucking industry have pointed to the safety apprentice driving policy requiring young drivers to first train with more experienced drivers. They also commonly argue that 18-year-olds are currently allowed to operate commercial vehicles, though within state borders, in many states across the country. Trucking Regulations & Public Safety\nAs a personal injury and workers’ compensation law firm that fights for victims across Chicago and the state of Illinois, our legal team at Leonard Law Group knows how crucially important trucking regulations are to protecting the public and ensuring commercial operators take the necessary steps to reduce risks of serious truck accidents. Over the years, we’ve represented many victims of truck accidents, including drivers of passenger vehicles hit by truckers and truck drivers themselves, and are well aware of the devastating and often life-altering damage these massive machines can cause. Because commercial trucks pose such overwhelming dangers on our roads, we know it is important for advocates, lawmakers, and the public to keep apprised of trucking industry efforts fueled by money and potential profits rather than any concern for public safety. Just because the status quo may allow teens to get behind the wheel of trucks in some states doesn’t mean it should be preserved and strengthened across the board. That’s what many safety advocates will continue to focus on as they track the new pilot program and prepare to fight efforts for implementing the regulatory change nationwide. Fighting for Truck Accident Victims\nAlthough trucking regulations have been prone to change, there are still numerous laws that apply to trucking operators and drivers and make them responsible for taking appropriate safety measures.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:07f77690-d438-48e2-a5a3-7c0529f81909>']}, {'passage': 'How to Get a Commercial Drivers License in Indiana\nAll drivers must possess a CDL in Indiana in order to operate a commercial motor vehicle (CMV) in the state. The Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) can issue a commercial drivers license to any driver that meets the state’s eligibility requirements and passes the state’s testing criteria. Applicants for a commercial license must be of a certain age, pass the necessary medical screening, be able to prove lawful presence in the U.S., and more, in order to be found eligible. Applications for a CDL license in Indiana must be submitted in person, to a BMV licensing agency. All drivers must apply for – and receive – their commercial permits before they will be allowed to apply for their full commercial licenses. Some drivers are exempt from needing to meet all of the state’s typical licensing requirements, like military personnel and some farmers. Drivers must complete knowledge exams and driving skills tests using a vehicle of the class and type that they will be licensed to operate. Several endorsements can be added to a license for drivers who meet the requirements. CDL Requirements in Indiana\nCDL requirements for drivers in Indiana include being at least 18 years of age at the time of submitting the application, if applying for an intrastate permit, or 21 years of age, if applying for an interstate license. Other CDL license requirements include:\n- Holding a valid IN driver’s license for at least one year before application. - Having a valid U.S. Social Security Number (SSN). - Passing the DOT medical exam (if applicable). - Passing the written CDL test. - Obtaining a learner’s permit. - Passing a driving skills test. How to Apply for a CDL Permit in Indiana\nAll Indiana drivers must first apply for – and receive – the CDL permit, or CLP, before they can be found eligible to apply for the full commercial operator’s license. Drivers applying for a CDL learners permit will be required to meet all of the abovementioned requirements, except for passing the driving skills test, which occurs later on to receive the full license. Applications for the CLP are accepted in person, at licensing agencies around the state. The BMV has an up-to-date list of all locations currently processing permit requests. According to IN CDL permit requirements, drivers will have to pass all of the written knowledge tests required, according to the type of license they are requesting. They will also be asked to pass a vision screening. Other requirements may be asked of drivers in some circumstances. Exam results are valid for 180 days. CDL Written Test in Indiana\nAll students must complete the general CDL written test, along with area-specific tests, depending on the driver’s vehicle class and desired endorsements. The CDL general knowledge test is required by all applying drivers, and along with any of the following exams:\n- All commercial vehicles drivers: General knowledge exam\n- All school bus drivers: School bus endorsement exam and passenger transport exam\n- All bus drivers: Passenger transport exam\n- Vehicle with air brakes: Air brakes exam\n- Combination of vehicles: Combination vehicle exam\n- Drivers required to transport hazardous material: Hazardous material exam\n- Drivers required to transport liquids in bulk: Tanker exam\n- Drivers required to pull double or triple trailers: Doubles/triples exam\nIndiana CDL Training Schools & Practice Tests\nCDL prep for Indiana drivers begins with reviewing the Commercial Driver’s License Manual issued by the BMV, which includes all of the details new commercial drivers need to know for the written and skills exams. Drivers can also choose to enroll in CDL school at any of a number of state-approved locations across the state. The BMV oversees all schooling for commercial drivers in Indiana to assure that they offer top-quality instruction and have qualified teachers. Although enrolling in a program for extra CDL training is highly encouraged by the BMV, it is not one of the requirements for receiving a CLP or full license. Drivers looking for hands-on instruction from drivers with years of experience can especially benefit from signing up. The BMV regularly publishes a list of approved truck driver training schools in Indiana from which drivers can choose.

That\'s why DMV.ORG has compiled a list of some of the most frequently asked questions regarding commercial drivers in Wisconsin. I want to drive a truck and go over the road but I\'m not 21 years old yet. Do I have to wait until I turn 21 years old to get my license? Not at all! You may apply for your CDL if you are 18 years old and as soon as you have completed your training and are ready to take the tests required for a commercial driver license. However, before you will be eligible to go over the road and drive outside of Wisconsin, you must be 21 years old. If you receive your CDL before then, you may drive intrastate (inside Wisconsin) until you do turn 21 years old. I\'m in truck driving school. What equipment will I be able to drive once I have my commercial driver license? What you are allowed to drive depends on two things: the license class and which, if any, endorsements you have. Here\'s a breakdown:\n- Class A: Allows you to drive any combination of vehicles with a combined GVWR of 26,001 lbs. or more, if the GVWR of the vehicle or vehicles being towed is in excess of 10,000 lbs. - Class B: Allows you to drive a single vehicle with a GVWR of 26,001 lbs. or more or any such vehicle with a trailer with a GVWR of no more than 10,000 lbs. - Class C: Allows you to drive any single vehicle, or combination of vehicles, that does not meet the definition of Class A or Class B, but is either designed to transport 16 passengers or more, including the driver, or is placarded for hazardous materials. If the equipment you want to drive is not listed in any of the above categories, then you will need to obtain an endorsement to add to your CDL. Here\'s a list of endorsement types, equipment, and cargo, along with the letter designation for the endorsement:\n- Bulk liquid tankers (N)\n- Doubles/Triples (T)\n- Passenger buses (P)\n- School buses (S)\n- Hazmat cargo, regardless of vehicle size (H)\nIf you want to be licensed to drive equipment with air brakes, then you need a separate endorsement for that. You must take an additional knowledge test and the vehicle you supply for your road test must have air brakes in order to get your authorization. I just saw an ad for school bus drivers and I\'d like to apply. I like kids, so I think I\'d be good at this. Besides a basic CDL, what else do I need? As you know, you must have a Class A CDL, plus the separate ""S"" endorsement in order to be allowed to drive a school bus. The Commercial Driver Manual is the section of the commercial driver manual for school bus drivers. I\'ve had a CDL for years and have driven over the road. I now have an opportunity to drive intrastate for one of the dairies. I can\'t remember if a tank with baffles requires an endorsement. Can you tell me? Yes, regardless of the internal safety equipment, driving a tanker will require a ""T"" endorsement on your CDL. I have a valid CDL from Minnesota, but my family just moved here to Wisconsin. Do I need to get a Wisconsin license, too? Actually, you will need to surrender your Minnesota CDL and apply for a Wisconsin CDL. According to Federal law, you may hold only one driver\'s license of any type, at any one time. You\'ll have 30 days in which to surrender your Minnesota license and apply for the transfer to a Wisconsin license. Do I need a CDL to drive a dump truck? Yes, if the vehicle is in the class of commercial vehicle, then you must obtain a CDL before you may drive it on public roads. The same is true for other construction equipment including cement mixers and other large vehicles. How about driving a water truck on a construction site? Does that require a CDL? It might surprise you to learn that if you drive any heavy equipment such as a water truck, rock truck, grader, or front loader, you do not need a CDL. This is because none of this type of equipment is ever driven over public roads. If the vehicle must be towed to the construction site, then it will not require a CDL in order to legally operate it.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:9c8cdacd-e41d-4048-9fc7-94ae7af1bc14>']}, {'passage': 'If you want to enter the world of truck driving, then you should apply for a CDL or commercial driver’s license training. However, before you apply, make sure that you are ready to handle the job. Truck driving is not just for anyone; it is only for those who can endure the type of work situation that this job involves, such as long hours and extreme conditions behind the wheel. Instruction is to ensure that you are equipped with the proper skills in order to handle the job like an expert. In the end, it all goes back to really wanting the job and being ready to put in the time and effort required to become successful. There different types of CDL requirements depending on the type of class of license that you are applying for. This is especially for those who are seeking additional endorsements to their licenses. New standards requirements have been set in place in order to meet the growing demand for safety and efficiency in the driving capabilities of those involved in commercial activities. This means that what may have worked ten or twenty years ago may not be applicable for those who wish to work as commercial drivers today. You will also need to be updated about newer regulations from the DOT if you want a thorough discussion of these rules. Typically, those who want to work as a semi-truck driver will need to get a Class A driver’s license. The first thing that you have to possess in order to qualify for a Class A commercial driver’s license is to be at the required age. This varies from one state to another as there are states who allow 16 to 17 year olds to apply for an intrastate commercial driver’s license whereas there are others who require applicants to have a minimum age of 18. You must check your local DMV office or website in order to learn more about their age requirements. Next, you will have to apply for an instruction permit. In order to do so, you will have to submit several requirements: a current and active driver’s license, a CDL application form (Form 735-155) which is available at your local DMV office, IDs that show your legal name, proof of your US citizenship or legal status in the US, birth certificate, and your Social Security number. After or before you submit these requirements at the local DMV office, you will be required to undergo a DOT physical exam. The exam is conducted in order to determine your physical fitness for the demanding job of being a commercial driver. After this, you will be asked to pass a written test which shall be based on the DMV CDL manual. You can get a copy of this manual in your local DMV office. Study the manual well before you take the written exam. Once you pass the written exam, you will then be given an instruction permit which will allow you to drive a commercial vehicle as long as you are accompanied by a licensed individual. The permit will only be valid for a set period of time so make sure that you learn as much as you can during the period. The DMV will also require you to undergo a medical and visual exam right before or after you take the actual test depending on the rules in your state. This is to make sure that you do not have a medical condition which can affect your driving capacity. Before your permit expires, you should be able to take the actual or practical exam for a CDL. You will have to visit the DMV office in order to know how you will be able to take this. If you pass this driving test, you will then be given your commercial driver’s license after paying the required fees. Those who desire a Class B driver’s license will often be pursued by those wanting to drive a bus, dump truck, or other commercial vehicle. Where to find CDL Training\nToday, you can find CDL schools in a variety of facilities and institutions. This is due to the fact that there is a large demand for truck drivers in the industry. Truck driving classes are being offered by community colleges, technical and vocational schools, as well as by private trucking companies who are looking for a steady supply of driver’s for their business. If you want to be sure that you are getting the best training possible, you can try searching for those which are accredited by national organizations or by the trucking industry. The training involves both theoretical teaching and practical sessions where you will be required to drive an actual truck. But before you enroll for these classes, you will be required to acquire an instruction permit first from your local DMV or BMV office so you can drive the truck. You also need to be specific about the type of commercial vehicle that you will be practicing on.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:553b4f46-457d-424d-8cc3-7cbc73de6a8c>']}, {'passage': 'If you haven’t heard of the Drive Safe Act, you may be either shocked or pleased to learn that a bill has been filed that would authorize 18-21 year olds to drive 18-wheelers professionally on the interstate, whereas now they must be 21. In most states, drivers can get their automobile drivers’ license at the age of 16, but the federal law states you must be 21 to drive a truck professionally. If the Drive Safe Act becomes a law, that will change. The Proposed Drive Safe Act\nOn February 26, 2019, The Drive Safe Act bill was introduced that, if passed, states drivers from 18-21 years old will be allowed to drive trucks professionally across state lines. Right now, drivers under the age of 21 can be a professional truck driver, but must remain in their home state until they reach the age of 21. This bill was introduced to reduce the interstate commercial truck driving age to 18 nationally in an effort to address a truck driver shortage. Currently in the United States, there is a 51,000 truck driver shortage and appears to be on a continuing rise, unless something is done. “DRIVE” Safe Act stands for Developing Responsible Individuals for a Vibrant Economy. Because of the concern for interstate safety knowing that 18 year olds may be soon operating 18-wheelers, there are requirements that must be met. First of all, the drivers must log 240 hours of on-duty drive time in the presence of an experienced truck driver as part of their job training. Furthermore, the trucks being driven by the trainees must come equipped with approved safety technologies such as automatic “active breaking” systems and dashboard cameras. Once these requirements are satisfied, that driver(s) will then be eligible to drive the trucks, moving freight, across state lines without limitation. All in Favor Say Aye\nThere are varying opinions on the Drive Safe Act, but those who are in favor of it have their reasons. Supporters strongly believe it will improve the national truck driving shortage and thus, enhance the job economy by giving younger people more job opportunities in this field. Supporters, in response to highway safety concerns, claim with the outlined extensive training program and safety equipped trucks, that safety is not a concern. Their argument is that safety/training are the focus and not the age of the driver. All Opposed Say Nay\nThis bill has a lot of people shaking their heads wondering how severely this will affect public safety if passed by legislation. Despite what the followers state, those against this Bill claim that age is a factor and studies show that young drivers are more likely to be involved in fatal crashes than their older counterparts. Furthermore, those against this bill state that instead of solving the trucking shortage, they are simply endangering others on the interstate and only putting a Band-Aid on the problem. Their belief is that by putting younger people behind the wheels of 18-wheelers, it will only drive the wages downward due to the increased truck driver expansion pool of young people. Right now, by maintaining a smaller pool of people, the wages remain high and could even rise to a higher level. That is not a Band-Aid, but a solution in the eyes of those protesting this Bill. Nothing to date has been resolved with the Drive Safe Act, so the issue remains until legislation votes.

                ""text"": ""The Commercial Driver Act (S.1672), introduced last month by Sen. Deb Fischer (R-NE) would let truck drivers under the age of 21 operate commercial motor vehicles across state lines. Now, 18- to 20-year old drivers are only allowed to drive intrastate. Participating states would have to enter the agreement and standardize the licensingrequirement for drivers who will travel between states. The American Trucking Association supports the legislation. \u201cRight now, an 18-year-old can drive a truck within the borders of his state, but not to deliver goods across state lines\u2014this means a young adult could drive a truck from El Paso, Texas to Dallas\u2014a distance of more than 600 miles\u2014but couldn\u2019t cross the street to deliver that same load from Texarkana, Texas to Texarkana, Ark.,\u201d said ATA President and CEO Bill Graves. According to the ATA, a main benefit of the Commercial Driver Act is that states would be able to impose safeguards to ensure young, inexperienced drivers learn safe trucking practice for the road. The ATA believes the change will draw younger people to trucking jobs; the legislation creates jobs for high school graduates who suffer from high unemployment rates. And, the US trucking industry is experiencing a driver shortage that is estimated to be short about 50,000 drivers, and will increase to 240,000 drivers by 2023. The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association has claimed that effective driver training is essential before any CDL rule changes are made. On the other hand, Sen. Deb Fisher\u2019s legislation meets strong opposition by the Truck Safety Coalition (TSC). The TSC opposes Fischer\u2019s language, mentioning an increase in truck-related crashes and injuries since 2009. According to the TSC, drivers under 21 lack experience and have a higher crash risk. The American Transportation Research Institute may have an idea to resolve the issue: it will work on a \u201cyounger driver assessment tool\u201d that identifies experienced drivers\u2019 behavior features and finds ways to teach young drivers such behaviors. The legislation is supported among professionals in the trucking industry; it proposes changes that could engage more young people to drive and will help relieve the driver shortage. Alternatively, there are safety concerns when it comes to young, inexperienced drivers who will operate long hours. The disputes will continue, while the highway bill is set for debate in the Senate."",

Driver's License: You must have a valid driver's license and a good driving record. 3. Medical Certification: You must provide a valid medical certificate that meets the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) medical standards. 4. Knowledge Tests: You must pass the general knowledge test and any applicable endorsement tests, such as air brakes and combination vehicles. 5. Commercial Learner's Permit (CLP): You must obtain a Commercial Learner's Permit (CLP) by passing the knowledge tests. 6. Training: You must complete behind-the-wheel training with a qualified instructor or employer, and practice driving with your CLP under the supervision of a licensed CDL holder. 7. Skills Test: You must pass a three-part skills test that includes pre-trip inspection, basic control skills, and an on-road driving test. 8. Fees: You must pay the required fees to obtain your Class A CDL license. It is important to note that additional requirements may apply depending on the type of commercial vehicle you plan to operate, such as endorsements for hazardous materials or passenger transport. It is important to note that some employers may have additional age requirements for their drivers, so it is important to check with potential employers to determine their specific hiring criteria. In Oregon, the following endorsements are available for Class A CDL holders:\n1. T - Double/Triple Trailers: To pull double or triple trailers. 2. P - Passenger: To transport passengers in a commercial vehicle. 3. N - Tank Vehicle: To transport liquids or gases in bulk containers. 4. H - Hazardous Materials: To transport hazardous materials as defined by federal regulations. 5. X - Combination of Tank Vehicle and Hazardous Materials: To transport both hazardous materials and liquids or gases in bulk containers. If you plan to operate a commercial vehicle that requires any of these endorsements, you will need to pass additional knowledge tests and meet other requirements, such as background checks and fingerprinting. 1. Pre-Trip Vehicle Inspection: You will be asked to perform a thorough inspection of your vehicle to ensure that it is safe to operate. This includes checking the brakes, steering, lights, tires, and other components. 2. Basic Vehicle Control: You will be asked to demonstrate your ability to control your vehicle in a variety of situations, such as backing up, turning, and maneuvering through a course. 3. On-Road Driving: You will be asked to drive your vehicle on public roads while demonstrating your ability to follow traffic laws, merge safely onto highways, change lanes, and make turns. Each part of the test is designed to evaluate your knowledge and skills related to operating a commercial vehicle safely and effectively. It is important to practice and prepare for the test by studying the Oregon Commercial Driver Manual and getting hands-on experience with a qualified instructor or mentor. 1. Air Brake Restriction: If you have not passed the air brake knowledge test and skills test, you will have an \""L\"" restriction on your license, which means you are not authorized to drive a commercial vehicle with air brakes. 2. Intrastate Only Restriction: If you do not meet the federal medical requirements or do not self-certify to operate in interstate commerce, you will have an \""O\"" restriction on your license, which means you are only authorized to operate commercial vehicles within Oregon. 3. Automatic Transmission Restriction: If you take your skills test in a vehicle with an automatic transmission, you will have an \""E\"" restriction on your license, which means you are not authorized to drive a commercial vehicle with a manual transmission. 4. Other restrictions: Depending on your driving history or other factors, you may have additional restrictions on your license, such as a restriction that limits you to driving during daylight hours or prohibits you from driving certain types of vehicles. It is important to understand and comply with any restrictions or limitations on your CDL license to avoid penalties or other consequences. However, it's important to note that the skills test and the pre-trip inspection test must be taken in English. This is because the CDL skills test requires clear communication between the examiner and the driver, and the pre-trip inspection test involves identifying and describing various components of a commercial vehicle using standard English terminology."",

3. **Dual-Stick Controls**: The game uses a dual-stick control scheme, enabling players to perform special moves like flip reversals and dodges with ease.

5. **Story Missions**: The game is packed with missions that follow the story of Nathan Zachary, the heroic protagonist, and his band of Fortune Hunters as they defend justice and gather riches.

6. **FMV Cutscenes**: The game includes full-motion video (FMV) cutscenes that set the tone and immerse players in the game's 1930s aesthetic.

### Context: Yo ho! Yo ho! A pirate's life for me. Okay, when I say pirates, what's the first thing that comes to your mind? Chances
are, you just pictured the skull and crossbones, some dude that looks like Captain
Hook, or even that drunk guy hanging out with a pig in the Pirates of the Caribbean
ride at Disneyland. But what if the path of history took a different course
and pirates turned out to be smooth talking, fearless warriors of the air rather
than liquor-guzzling sea ruffians? Well, Microsoft and Zipper Interactive have
imagined just that and cranked out a game worthy of an old Hollywood studio. It is a world of gutsy pilots and high adventure. The Great Depression has
struck, destroying the progress of all ground transportation, leaving the skies
to serve as the ultimate roadway of the future. Here, survival means gripping
the flight stick of a tricked-out muscle plane and letting your guns do the
talking. Fly or die with the guys and dolls of Crimson Skies. Crimson Skies is a beautiful, guns-blazing, lip-biting, heart-pounding
flight action game. Packed with plenty of attitude, the game's combination of
sim elements and arcade hijinks sets it apart from the rest of the field
One of Crimson Skies' biggest assets is the universe that it is set
in. Starting off as an air-combat based board game, the world of Crimson Skies
is intricately detailed and well chronicled. Everything about the game, from
the characters to the movies to the sound, simply screams romantic era 1930's
You are Nathan Zachary, the heroic Robin Hood of the skies. With your band
of merry men and women known as the Fortune Hunters, you'll fly over 24 missions
to defend justice, honor, and a fat wallet. I mean, what is piracy without a
little booty here and there? The FMV cut scenes lend a hand in creating the tone of the game by taking on
feel of watching an old feature film from Hollywood's early days. Run in black
and white with all the static of the old films, these movie sequences are like
something out of a History Channel documentary. With all this good stuff going for it, the only thing that could shoot down
this game would be bad gameplay. Fortunately, gameplay is where Crimson Skies
truly soars. In much the same way as the Playstaion smash hit Driver,
the game does a marvelous balancing act between flight sim realism and in-your-face,
frantic action. Players can jump into the thick of things without reading volumes
upon volumes of flight manuals. While you don't need to boggle your mind with
thoughts of ailerons and HUD's, you do need to watch out for engine stalls and
that pesky gravity, which will cancel your flight faster than a rogue hurricane
off the Florida coast. This is definitely a game for gamers, not flight school
all this goodness isn't enough, the Crimson Skies crew keeps it coming. The game runs on a tweaked version of the Combat Flight Sim engine
to bring you some superior visuals. The graphics are excellent, with smooth
textures and plenty of details everywhere. You'll see your plane take damage
and catch fire when the action gets hot and heavy, witness wing flaps move as
your plane changes directions, and delight as stray shots hitting the water
send splashes skyward. As you progress through the missions, you'll gain money that can be put towards
the purchase of your very own custom plane. We're not just talking about a new
coat of paint, we're talking about a choice of engine, armor, style and payload. Of course, your new frame must be able to support the weight of it all, so don't
get too carried away. For those of you that just want to jump into the fray without any of this
""story"" business, Crimson Skies also includes an Instant Action mode. Want to dogfight a squadron of enemy fighters? No problem. Try to hijack a zeppelin? You got it. If time is short or you just feel like blowing stuff up, this mode
has what it takes to fulfill all your piratical needs. The game's music also immerses you completely in a 1930's mindset with authentic
sounding swing music. The Grade-A voice acting is terrific as well.

I was able to play a few levels at a Capcom event yesterday and also bring a build to the office, giving me a look at a few levels from various bits of the game as well as the opening sequences. The game starts off with you playing as soldier, testing out a new Tesla-designed rocket pack. Of course, no game would be complete without a sneak attack by the enemy, so a group of UFOs show up to give you an introduction to the game's flight mechanics. After dispatching a group of them, the character you start with looks to be killed and you then take control of the game's protagonist, Will, about a week later. By default, the flight controls are inverted to act like regular plane controls, while the ground combat is not, which for me helps make it feel a little more separated. If you've played Crimson Skies, you'll be familiar with a lot of the dual-stick clicking special moves, like flip reversals and dodges. This isn't very surprising as the Airtight Games team was formed from the dissolved staff that worked on Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge, and their experience shows through nicely as the controls are smooth, responsive and relatively easy to use. This sequence, which I also had a chance to play at the event as there's a nearly identical (but much more extended) sequence later in the game, takes place near a cliff side overlooking an ocean. Large rock pillars give you plenty of things to dodge and use for cover during the battle to make it more interesting than open air. In the prologue, you basically just take down a couple ships and then get put out of your misery. When you return later as Will, after you clear the skies you'll need to turn your attention to some ground troops. One cool bit to the game is that the flying and ground-based mechanics are blurred by your ability to hover. When you do this, you're still airborne and can travel in six directions (albeit much more slowly than standard flight), but you also have total control over where you're shooting rather than just in front of you. The game encourages you to make use of your hovering ability as the enemies will have a harder time picking you out of the sky than if you're standing on solid ground. Since I had just jumped right into this sequence (the first thing I played was the second time in the part, playing as Will), switching between flying, standing on solid ground and hovering took some getting used to strictly in a button command sense (I can't even remember how to do it offhand), though I imagine that when you actually run through the game this'll be much more natural by this point. While the flight bits feel a lot like Crimson Skies (which is great), the ground combat is very much akin to what you'll find in a lot of third-person shooters these days, which makes it easy to jump right into. You can take cover and then fire blindly, aim down your sights with some guns and generally go about things like you would in something like Uncharted or Gears of War. Again though, what makes this unique is the ability to take to the skies at pretty much any time and change up the way you take on combat. You won't always have flight, though. Early on in the game, once you take control of Will, you'll be on foot and fighting enemies in a more ""classic"" sense until you eventually find the jet pack. This opening sequence takes place in the jungle, and while you won't find the sort of platforming bits to do ala Uncharted, it does make for a rather stark contrast to the more mechanical stuff you'll see later on. An example of this is a cylindrical generator shaft that you'll come to later where you're tasked with shutting down the power. Blue electrical bolts fly pretty much everywhere here, and the deep chasm formed by the shaft means that you'll have to make use of your hover ability a lot during combat. Dark Void is set to ship early next year. In the meantime, take a look at our media pages for new screens and video, and keep your eyes peeled for details on how you can win a Tesla Roadster as part of a promotional giveaway that Capcom is holding for the game.

WHAT IS THE SPIRE? Spire is a new stand-alone roleplaying game from the designers of Unbound and Goblin Quest. It’s like D&D crossed with Unknown Armies, or Gormenghast crossed with Necromunda: a city-bound fantasy horror game of terrible decisions, hard choices, and deeply personal loss. Spire is a city of a thousand gods: Our Glorious Lady, the light of the moon, beloved of the drow (and her sisters, the dark side of the moon and the eclipse, whose worship is banned by the high elves); the Solar Pantheon, great and terrible, who dominate the city from glittering cathedrals; the ravenous Hungry Deep that slumbers beneath the city; the laughing carrion god Charnel, whose hyenas prowl the bloody streets of New Heaven. Worship of these gods can grant miracles to the faithful - player characters included. It is a place of industry and profit: human retro-engineers arrive with armfuls of arcane technology dug up from forgotten dungeons of a lost civilisation, then hotwire them into life and sell cheap copies down in the lawless undercity. There are acres of underground lakes brimming with algae; dark farms where the dead hang from spidersilk, their bodies dotted with fungi; and the vast, cursed, never-completed Vermissian, a failed attempt at a subterranean travel network. It is a place of horror, too: bloodwitches return from the Heart, the rotten hole in reality that is the centre of Spire, carrying mystical blood diseases that rewrite men’s minds; spider-skinned midwives sprout additional chitinous limbs to defend unborn drow; magic masks are sutured to unwilling faces; hearts are plucked out and stored in jars, so that the owner might have eternal, strange life at the hands of the Morticians.

In this post I will talk about the future features of the game and ideas of mine. Feel free to comment! One of my goal is, that the game should be 2-3 hours long. I believe that is a huge amount of work but I am optimistic that I can do it. The game is not an open world game. It is level based like Cry of Fear. You go to a door, press “e” and you load the next level. You can also go back to see if you missed something. If you think of Cry of Fear, there was an inventory system. This won’t be in Obscuritas. The only things you will be able to pick up are keys and notes. As it is usual in a horror game, there will be some evil stuff in the game, like scares. Therefore Obscuritas is more an interactive story than an “real” FPS. While you play you discover more and more about Vincent and what happened to him. Of course there will be some things you can do and you also should feel scared while you play it. For now that’s all I want to tell. I will write development diaries when I have done enough for one. That’s why you should stay tuned to me and my game. You can also read this on IndieDB:

Vincent has predicted this game might ""behave in some subtly strange ways online."" (linky
I'm not too worried. I think the game will play fine. We can, however, expect some rules discussion, so this thread is for that. From reading the rule clarification questions that have popped up in places, I see some advice and feedback that I think will help our on-line play. Tips
We should Describe Actions first; consequences are negotiated later. (Vincent, The Forge
Be comfortable to back track slightly from described events. The above distinction (Action vs. consequences) might not be entirely clear at all times. If we find confusion, we might need to rewind a bit. Be prudent with your narrative power. Unless another character ""can and would try to interfere"" with the stated concrete action, we don't roll dice. Also, I'd like to put out some words of encouragement to keep the enthusiasm and posting pace going. Each post need not be some spectacular literary event. Any response is better than letting the game die. So don't hesitate to ask other players for input or ideas. Even just ""dialing it in"" on occasion to keep the story moving is perfectly fine with me.

Crimson Shroud blends the design from the old-school class of turn-based JRPG with the oldest of the old west(ern style of role-playing games). I’m not talking about Baldur’s Gate or Icewind Dale, either. I’m talking about 20-sided dice, percentage chances and saving throws. The success of just about everything you do during Crimson Shroud’s otherwise fairly traditional turn-based combat is determined and/or enhanced by using the 3DS touchscreen to roll digital dice. Dice don’t just play a role in the game’s look, however. Starting a combo by repeatedly casting spells of different elements will earn you more dice that can then be added either to your odds of successfully attacking or to the damage dealt by them. But, if you think you can get by without, banking your dice for later will allow you to loot more items at the end of combat. Further supporting the game’s style is the fact that every character in the game — from NPCs to party members — is represented by a mounted miniature. More important in bringing the style to life than either of those touches is the game’s dedication to narration. The entire story (which is, unfortunately, conveyed entirely without voice acting) is narrated by a sort of disembodied dungeon master in the second-person. Of all the wonderful touches Crimson Shroud includes to set the stage, this is the most effective and endearingly low-tech. It’s a shame, then, that the story Level 5 decided to tell isn’t very exciting. Our band of heroes is sent off in search of the titular and mysterious Crimson Shroud, rumored to be the source of the magical “gifts” that makes the game’s world go round. Besides a couple of predictable twists and a cliffhanger ending, that’s more or less the entire story. Crimson Shroud isn’t a terribly long game. That’s understandable considering its $8 price tag and status as a Guild01 experiment. That’s not meant as a knock against the game. Crimson Shroud doesn’t try to make you feel like it’s the only game you’ll need all year. It sets up an interesting structure and the tools to play with it, and then wraps up once its tricks have been exhausted. Crimson Shroud knows when its time is up and doesn’t try to claw at your free time for more than you have the patience to offer. That’s something that every RPG could stand to learn. What really keeps the game concise is the way that it completely circumvents the issue of grinding by ignoring character leveling systems entirely. Regrettably only leads to another. Since stats and magic attacks are tied to gear drops rather than character progression it’s easy to find yourself completely unprepared for enemy encounters. This traps you in the cycle of picking a fight, hoping you have whatever spells will work properly and then either dying or restarting from your last save and trying again with different gear if you found yourself unprepared. Poking the touchscreen to set virtual d20s tumbling is no more effective than plucking a random integer from thin air. It’s a neat gimmick, but one that can start to feel tedious once you start to think about what you’re actually doing. It’s also painfully obvious that the molded miniature aesthetic and non-voiced story were chosen as much for their cost-effectiveness as nostalgia. It certainly doesn’t help that most of the character models are so poorly rendered that it’s often difficult to make out exactly what they’re supposed to look like. However, none of that makes the player feel any less like a massive nerd scratching charisma bonuses onto a character sheet. That sense of belonging that only understanding acronyms like GURPS (ahem) can engender has (perhaps justifiably) been missing from games for some time. While Crimson Shroud certainly isn’t Planescape: Torment 2 (ahem), it does feel like a heartfelt attempt at invoking those old feelings in new ways. On its own, that loop is incredibly frustrating, particularly during boss fights. Delivering further disappointing drudgery is the developer’s baffling decision to make the abilities associated with an item invisible until they’ve been equipped.

Does the game contain the ingredients the author chose? Are they nice and central? Is the use of them interesting? Is the game tight? Does it have no distracting bits that get cut off in actual play? Is the setting completely supported by the system? Is the system completely enclosed by the setting? Does the game do what it tries to do? Judging on polish of presentation is unfair for a short project like this. But still, I want to see a game with flair and interesting stuff and ideas. Can I pick this up and run with it? I don't mean ""Did you remember the 'what is roleplaying' chapter"" (unless you're making a very non-traditional game), but I do want it to have enough rules to be able to play, enough description to know how I am to play it, enough setting to know what I'm playing, and enough ideas that as a GM and a player I can think of at least a few different ways things could go. The most important, but hardest to describe category. Is your game enjoyable? Is it pure awesome?

What is Cyberpunk 2077 gameplay like? Cyberpunk 2077 is a role-playing first-person shooter, and the character named, V is fully customizable according to cdkeysforgames.com. You have a lot of choices when it comes to creating your male or female, V character. In the appearance section, you can choose the body type, face, hair, and voice just to name a few. There are several classifications and gameplay options that are sure to give a unique identity regardless of your choices. Your V character will have several stats to increase as you play and they’re capable of numerous actions such as climbing walls and taking cover and there are multiple weapon choices and essentially all the fully customizable game options that you would expect from a new first-person shooter
The world of Cyberpunk 2077. V is a mercenary running gun in the face of a tragic dystopian city, fallen into crime and violence in the wake of a major economic crash. Homelessness and violence abound in the city so it is a survival of the fittest. It is a world full of crime lords and big business that is above the law and justice. The desperate situation of the city is not a sign of dark or boring graphics. The city is described as a beautiful technological and futuristic wonder. The towering skyscrapers and the world of neon are only contrasted by life on the ground that can get down and dirty. The city is teeming with people and flying cars and it seems to have a lot of atmosphere going on. In a matrix styled world with cyborgs, there is no shortage of guns and speed as you make the city your own. What is the inspiration for Cyberpunk 2077? Some of the inspiration for cyberpunk 2077 comes from the 1982 science fiction movie Bladerunner. But there are inspirational points all through the game that draw from an assortment of Manga, Anime, books and video games. The voice and motion action for Johnny Silverhand is that of Keanu Reeves. There is much more inspiration going on throughout the game. The somewhat hidden codes when it comes to inspirational points seem to add to the mystery and culture of the game world. Development and release. Cyberpunk 2077 has been a long time coming. First announced in 2012, fans had little to go on except a teaser trailer released in 2013. But it seems the wait is about over and the only date we have to go on now is April 16, 2020. Pre-orders have already begun and we will soon get the green light for play. Cyberpunk 2077 has already received numerous awards and plans for books, postcards, stickers, and soundtrack are already in the making. The game is about to begin.","[{'passage': 'Yo ho! Yo ho! A pirate\'s life for me. Okay, when I say pirates, what\'s the first thing that comes to your mind? Chances\nare, you just pictured the skull and crossbones, some dude that looks like Captain\nHook, or even that drunk guy hanging out with a pig in the Pirates of the Caribbean\nride at Disneyland. But what if the path of history took a different course\nand pirates turned out to be smooth talking, fearless warriors of the air rather\nthan liquor-guzzling sea ruffians? Well, Microsoft and Zipper Interactive have\nimagined just that and cranked out a game worthy of an old Hollywood studio. It is a world of gutsy pilots and high adventure. The Great Depression has\nstruck, destroying the progress of all ground transportation, leaving the skies\nto serve as the ultimate roadway of the future. Here, survival means gripping\nthe flight stick of a tricked-out muscle plane and letting your guns do the\ntalking. Fly or die with the guys and dolls of Crimson Skies. Crimson Skies is a beautiful, guns-blazing, lip-biting, heart-pounding\nflight action game. Packed with plenty of attitude, the game\'s combination of\nsim elements and arcade hijinks sets it apart from the rest of the field\nOne of Crimson Skies\' biggest assets is the universe that it is set\nin. Starting off as an air-combat based board game, the world of Crimson Skies\nis intricately detailed and well chronicled. Everything about the game, from\nthe characters to the movies to the sound, simply screams romantic era 1930\'s\nYou are Nathan Zachary, the heroic Robin Hood of the skies. With your band\nof merry men and women known as the Fortune Hunters, you\'ll fly over 24 missions\nto defend justice, honor, and a fat wallet. I mean, what is piracy without a\nlittle booty here and there? The FMV cut scenes lend a hand in creating the tone of the game by taking on\nfeel of watching an old feature film from Hollywood\'s early days. Run in black\nand white with all the static of the old films, these movie sequences are like\nsomething out of a History Channel documentary. With all this good stuff going for it, the only thing that could shoot down\nthis game would be bad gameplay. Fortunately, gameplay is where Crimson Skies\ntruly soars. In much the same way as the Playstaion smash hit Driver,\nthe game does a marvelous balancing act between flight sim realism and in-your-face,\nfrantic action. Players can jump into the thick of things without reading volumes\nupon volumes of flight manuals. While you don\'t need to boggle your mind with\nthoughts of ailerons and HUD\'s, you do need to watch out for engine stalls and\nthat pesky gravity, which will cancel your flight faster than a rogue hurricane\noff the Florida coast. This is definitely a game for gamers, not flight school\nall this goodness isn\'t enough, the Crimson Skies crew keeps it coming. The game runs on a tweaked version of the Combat Flight Sim engine\nto bring you some superior visuals. The graphics are excellent, with smooth\ntextures and plenty of details everywhere. You\'ll see your plane take damage\nand catch fire when the action gets hot and heavy, witness wing flaps move as\nyour plane changes directions, and delight as stray shots hitting the water\nsend splashes skyward. As you progress through the missions, you\'ll gain money that can be put towards\nthe purchase of your very own custom plane. We\'re not just talking about a new\ncoat of paint, we\'re talking about a choice of engine, armor, style and payload. Of course, your new frame must be able to support the weight of it all, so don\'t\nget too carried away. For those of you that just want to jump into the fray without any of this\n""story"" business, Crimson Skies also includes an Instant Action mode. Want to dogfight a squadron of enemy fighters? No problem. Try to hijack a zeppelin? You got it. If time is short or you just feel like blowing stuff up, this mode\nhas what it takes to fulfill all your piratical needs. The game\'s music also immerses you completely in a 1930\'s mindset with authentic\nsounding swing music. The Grade-A voice acting is terrific as well.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:cb418f65-8567-428d-a715-3c81864ba6e1>']}, {'passage': 'I was able to play a few levels at a Capcom event yesterday and also bring a build to the office, giving me a look at a few levels from various bits of the game as well as the opening sequences. The game starts off with you playing as soldier, testing out a new Tesla-designed rocket pack. Of course, no game would be complete without a sneak attack by the enemy, so a group of UFOs show up to give you an introduction to the game\'s flight mechanics. After dispatching a group of them, the character you start with looks to be killed and you then take control of the game\'s protagonist, Will, about a week later. By default, the flight controls are inverted to act like regular plane controls, while the ground combat is not, which for me helps make it feel a little more separated. If you\'ve played Crimson Skies, you\'ll be familiar with a lot of the dual-stick clicking special moves, like flip reversals and dodges. This isn\'t very surprising as the Airtight Games team was formed from the dissolved staff that worked on Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge, and their experience shows through nicely as the controls are smooth, responsive and relatively easy to use. This sequence, which I also had a chance to play at the event as there\'s a nearly identical (but much more extended) sequence later in the game, takes place near a cliff side overlooking an ocean. Large rock pillars give you plenty of things to dodge and use for cover during the battle to make it more interesting than open air. In the prologue, you basically just take down a couple ships and then get put out of your misery. When you return later as Will, after you clear the skies you\'ll need to turn your attention to some ground troops. One cool bit to the game is that the flying and ground-based mechanics are blurred by your ability to hover. When you do this, you\'re still airborne and can travel in six directions (albeit much more slowly than standard flight), but you also have total control over where you\'re shooting rather than just in front of you. The game encourages you to make use of your hovering ability as the enemies will have a harder time picking you out of the sky than if you\'re standing on solid ground. Since I had just jumped right into this sequence (the first thing I played was the second time in the part, playing as Will), switching between flying, standing on solid ground and hovering took some getting used to strictly in a button command sense (I can\'t even remember how to do it offhand), though I imagine that when you actually run through the game this\'ll be much more natural by this point.

The success of just about everything you do during Crimson Shroud’s otherwise fairly traditional turn-based combat is determined and/or enhanced by using the 3DS touchscreen to roll digital dice. Dice don’t just play a role in the game’s look, however. Starting a combo by repeatedly casting spells of different elements will earn you more dice that can then be added either to your odds of successfully attacking or to the damage dealt by them. But, if you think you can get by without, banking your dice for later will allow you to loot more items at the end of combat. Further supporting the game’s style is the fact that every character in the game — from NPCs to party members — is represented by a mounted miniature. More important in bringing the style to life than either of those touches is the game’s dedication to narration. The entire story (which is, unfortunately, conveyed entirely without voice acting) is narrated by a sort of disembodied dungeon master in the second-person. Of all the wonderful touches Crimson Shroud includes to set the stage, this is the most effective and endearingly low-tech. It’s a shame, then, that the story Level 5 decided to tell isn’t very exciting. Our band of heroes is sent off in search of the titular and mysterious Crimson Shroud, rumored to be the source of the magical “gifts” that makes the game’s world go round. Besides a couple of predictable twists and a cliffhanger ending, that’s more or less the entire story. Crimson Shroud isn’t a terribly long game. That’s understandable considering its $8 price tag and status as a Guild01 experiment. That’s not meant as a knock against the game. Crimson Shroud doesn’t try to make you feel like it’s the only game you’ll need all year. It sets up an interesting structure and the tools to play with it, and then wraps up once its tricks have been exhausted. Crimson Shroud knows when its time is up and doesn’t try to claw at your free time for more than you have the patience to offer. That’s something that every RPG could stand to learn. What really keeps the game concise is the way that it completely circumvents the issue of grinding by ignoring character leveling systems entirely. Regrettably only leads to another. Since stats and magic attacks are tied to gear drops rather than character progression it’s easy to find yourself completely unprepared for enemy encounters. This traps you in the cycle of picking a fight, hoping you have whatever spells will work properly and then either dying or restarting from your last save and trying again with different gear if you found yourself unprepared. Poking the touchscreen to set virtual d20s tumbling is no more effective than plucking a random integer from thin air. It’s a neat gimmick, but one that can start to feel tedious once you start to think about what you’re actually doing. It’s also painfully obvious that the molded miniature aesthetic and non-voiced story were chosen as much for their cost-effectiveness as nostalgia. It certainly doesn’t help that most of the character models are so poorly rendered that it’s often difficult to make out exactly what they’re supposed to look like. However, none of that makes the player feel any less like a massive nerd scratching charisma bonuses onto a character sheet. That sense of belonging that only understanding acronyms like GURPS (ahem) can engender has (perhaps justifiably) been missing from games for some time. While Crimson Shroud certainly isn’t Planescape: Torment 2 (ahem), it does feel like a heartfelt attempt at invoking those old feelings in new ways. On its own, that loop is incredibly frustrating, particularly during boss fights. Delivering further disappointing drudgery is the developer’s baffling decision to make the abilities associated with an item invisible until they’ve been equipped.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:81835028-627f-4f0e-beca-60288697ae07>']}, {'passage': 'Does the game contain the ingredients the author chose?

Cyberpunk 2077 is a role-playing first-person shooter, and the character named, V is fully customizable according to cdkeysforgames.com. You have a lot of choices when it comes to creating your male or female, V character. In the appearance section, you can choose the body type, face, hair, and voice just to name a few. There are several classifications and gameplay options that are sure to give a unique identity regardless of your choices. Your V character will have several stats to increase as you play and they’re capable of numerous actions such as climbing walls and taking cover and there are multiple weapon choices and essentially all the fully customizable game options that you would expect from a new first-person shooter\nThe world of Cyberpunk 2077. V is a mercenary running gun in the face of a tragic dystopian city, fallen into crime and violence in the wake of a major economic crash. Homelessness and violence abound in the city so it is a survival of the fittest. It is a world full of crime lords and big business that is above the law and justice. The desperate situation of the city is not a sign of dark or boring graphics. The city is described as a beautiful technological and futuristic wonder. The towering skyscrapers and the world of neon are only contrasted by life on the ground that can get down and dirty. The city is teeming with people and flying cars and it seems to have a lot of atmosphere going on. In a matrix styled world with cyborgs, there is no shortage of guns and speed as you make the city your own. What is the inspiration for Cyberpunk 2077? Some of the inspiration for cyberpunk 2077 comes from the 1982 science fiction movie Bladerunner. But there are inspirational points all through the game that draw from an assortment of Manga, Anime, books and video games. The voice and motion action for Johnny Silverhand is that of Keanu Reeves. There is much more inspiration going on throughout the game. The somewhat hidden codes when it comes to inspirational points seem to add to the mystery and culture of the game world. Development and release. Cyberpunk 2077 has been a long time coming. First announced in 2012, fans had little to go on except a teaser trailer released in 2013. But it seems the wait is about over and the only date we have to go on now is April 16, 2020. Pre-orders have already begun and we will soon get the green light for play. Cyberpunk 2077 has already received numerous awards and plans for books, postcards, stickers, and soundtrack are already in the making.

                ""text"": ""In the land of video games, it always amazes me that a plot-line starting with \u201cA wizard, a rogue, and a warrior\u201d isn\u2019t immediately followed by \u201c\u2026walk into a bar.\u201d Ultimately that is what Crimson Alliance, a new XBLA title from Certain Affinity, is all about. Well, perhaps the foreign land of Byzan instead of bar, and instead of walking they\u2019re running as fast as possible and leaving a trail of death and dismemberment behind them. The basic action/RPG gameplay and visual presentation mirrors games like Torchlight or the much anticipated Diablo III; the key difference is that they do away with all that messy depth. If this sounds like a bad thing, you should read on. Crimson Alliance does what a lot of other games don\u2019t \u2013 it is unapologetic in its presentation, and puts up rather than shuts up. While there are hidden rooms and treasures to find on almost every level, there is no creeping around, side quests or path-finding \u2013 the game is all about unabashed combat regardless of the character you select. Furthermore, you aren\u2019t subjected to five minute CGI cutscenes during major plot points: instead you hear banter and background between the three protaganists while watching slideshows of beautifully painted scenes that give the game a very organic feel. Some of the comments have even had me laughing out loud, even if the main plot twist is plainly obvious. One of the other things that this Action-RPG-Lite game does right trying is not saddling you with stats management or a complex inventory system. There are three item types (which vary depending on class): your main weapon, your secondary weapon, and your armor. Each of the three will boost up to four stats in a range from 1-20 : your three basic attack types (damage, stun, clearing) as well as your health. There are also special powers available on some equipment, and each item will show its impact to your overall stats. Every 5 points in each respective category earns you a significant improvement to the skill i.e. thrown daggers may fly farther and faster at level 5, 10, 15, and 20 on top of the natural damage increases that each point earns. You can also switch your equipment without going to an inventory screen, but the downside is that the game doesn\u2019t pause during this process. Certain Affinity also saw fit to include four types of single-use items that help you during battle, and each is assigned to your directional pad and triggered with the RB button (more on that later). You have a health totem which refills your health over time based on proximity, an automatic turret that pelts enemies in range, a fiery axe which is thrown like a grenade, and monster bait. You can carry a maximum of three of each at a time, and if you\u2019re playing multiplayer you can even drop them to share with others by holding the RB button down. I suppose the question of value is really the question of quality \u2013 what is quality? It is the measure of delivering to people\u2019s expectations. This game isn\u2019t Diablo III or even Torchlight. If there were one game I\u2019d compare it to it would be Castle Crashers \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have the same art, but just like Castle Crashers the combat is accessible, the upgrades are simple to understand and it allows you to balance and tweak your combat style based on your equipment. One other improvement I would have suggested is allowing the gamers to change buttons. I found that having my RB trigger items and my LB trigger my \u201cultra\u201d move it didn\u2019t work for me as well as I would have liked.. I would rather have had my items trigger with a directional press, and perhaps allowing me to switch weapon types on the fly with the RB. This isn\u2019t a knock against the game, but spending as much time as I did with the Crimson Alliance, this would have added some neat dynamics that could have maximized the on-the-fly equipment change effect."",

Features and benefits are easily confused. As a guy, it’s easy for me to get wrapped up in the gee-whiz specifications of a product. See if these terms ring true for you:
- Retina display
- 1080p LCD digital display
- 320 horsepower
- 64 GB RAM
- 0-60 in 4.8 seconds
- .364 batting average
We’ve all seen lists like this. They often show up on websites for a product and are touted as the specifications that make you want to buy the product over a competing offering. But what does it all really mean? When I hold up one laptop computer’s specifications against those of another, I can definitely see the differences – but why should I care? When I went through my master’s degree studies, it became readily apparent of the differences between features and benefits. As my classmates would present their project or pitch, you began to understand which ones were compelling and which ones fell flat. The distinguishing characteristic, more often than not, was in the presenter’s understanding of features and benefits. Let’s look at this more closely. Features are like the specifications on the side of the box or on the product website. Features are what distinguish one product from all others in its space. A feature-rich product is one that we think of as full of the latest bells and whistles, and is often what drives the price of the product. Features are what product and software developers get hung up on quite often, and are what the naive salesperson pitches to their prospects. Lots of product packaging and advertising is consumed by the list of features. See our page on Features of Scrum. Benefits, on the other hand, are often not spelled out on a product’s label. Benefits, more than anything else, are what will compel a potential client or user to purchase a particular product. It is the overall value that they will derive from their experience with that product. For consumer-based products, the vast majority of manufacturers leave it to the purchaser to establish their own list of benefits. Quite often, all they have to gauge their assessment on is the list of features. If the consumer cannot understand what the feature does for them, then no benefit is perceived. The seasoned sales professional finds out what their customer wants and maps the features of their product to the benefits that the customer seeks. Check out out page on Benefits of Scrum. As a product owner on an Agile team, if you do not understand who your customer is, then you will have a hard time connecting features and benefits to their needs. That is why it is vital to know your customer and know their needs so that you can decide what goes in the product. Fortunately in Agile, there is a tool to help us accomplish just that – the user story. A good set of user stories make the connection between the features and benefits. User stories are in the form of “As a [role], I want [goal] so I can [reason].” For purposes of this blog, let’s rewrite this template as follows: “As a [customer], I want [feature] so I can [benefit].” This is critical to a successful product development process. You have to know why your customer might buy something before deciding what feature set to include in the product. Don’t overlook this critical component of the Agile process. Create good user stories and during your sprint reviews you’ll be able to connect features and benefits to the delight your customer. If you’re ready to take a look at Agile, or to learn more about the methodology, Braintrust Consulting is here to help. We offer training and coaching on the Agile methodology leading to such certifications for your team as Certified ScrumMaster and Certified Scrum Product Owner.

Child-oriented life insurances offer a waiver of premium option under which future premiums are paid by the insurer if the parent dies or contracts a critical illness.

What is a Product? “Product is anything that can be offered to someone to satisfy a need or a want.”-Philip Kotler. What are Product Features? Product features are defined as a product’s traits or attributes that deliver value to end-users or customers. When it comes to software, product features can include any softwares functionalities, capabilities, and even its visual characteristics are known as the user interface. But the main trait of any product feature is the value it delivers to a customer. Difference between Features vs benefits ? Features refer to the specific functionalities, characteristics, or properties of the product or service. These are the tangible and measurable aspects of what the product or service can do or offer. For example, the features of a smartphone might include a high-resolution camera, a large storage capacity, and a fast processor. Benefits, on the other hand, refer to the positive outcomes or advantages that the user or customer will experience from using the product or service. Benefits are often intangible and emotional, and they focus on how the product or service can improve the customer's life or solve a problem. For example, the benefits of a smartphone might include the ability to capture high-quality photos, stay connected with friends and family, and access information quickly and easily. How to prioritize Product Features? Feature prioritization is the process of deciding which features to implement first. It determines which features should be implemented first to maximize the product's value. Prioritizing product features can be a complex process, but here are some general steps you can follow:
Identify the problem your product is solving: Start by understanding the problem your product is solving and the value it brings to your target market. Define your product vision: Create a product vision statement that outlines the key benefits and features of your product. Gather customer feedback: Collect feedback from your customers or potential customers through surveys, interviews, and user testing to identify the features that are most important to them. Analyze data: Analyze data on how customers are currently using your product and what features are being used the most. Prioritize features based on impact and effort: Use a prioritization framework such as the ""MoSCoW method"" (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have) or ""RICE"" (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) to prioritize features based on their potential impact and the effort required to implement them. Set goals: Set clear goals for each feature, including what problem it solves, what benefit it brings, and what metrics you will use to measure its success. Review and adjust: Regularly review and adjust your feature prioritization based on customer feedback, market changes, and other factors that may impact your product's success.

It’s never too early to start saving, and putting aside money for a child today will mean they may have more tomorrow. What savings accounts are out there? How do I get started? 1. Consider a goal\nIt could be a good idea to choose a goal to save towards for your child, but it’s equally just as important to save for the sake of it. The goal may well materialise as you’re saving, and it means you’ve started making a difference to their future without knowing what it may look like. 2. Make sure you know how much you can save\nHaving a plan to reach a certain level of saving or to reach a specific goal is a useful way of sticking to your commitment. Knowing how you’re going to save such as lump sum, regular payments or a combination of both, even if you start small, is the best approach you can take. 3. Decide where to save\nChoose a product that you’re comfortable with. How you’re saving should suit you, your capacity for risk, tax benefits and desired returns. 4. Keep an eye on your savings\nEnsure you review your savings regularly to make sure you’re on the right path. Sticking to a plan is important, as over time you should see your child’s savings grow.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:c96d2a32-0a76-4ea7-9f3c-42e07c6ecee8>']}, {'passage': 'The benefits of day care\nChild care (“daycare” and/or “creche”) is the caring for and supervision of a child or children, usually from age six weeks to age thirteen.

As a guy, it’s easy for me to get wrapped up in the gee-whiz specifications of a product. See if these terms ring true for you:\n- Retina display\n- 1080p LCD digital display\n- 320 horsepower\n- 64 GB RAM\n- 0-60 in 4.8 seconds\n- .364 batting average\nWe’ve all seen lists like this. They often show up on websites for a product and are touted as the specifications that make you want to buy the product over a competing offering. But what does it all really mean? When I hold up one laptop computer’s specifications against those of another, I can definitely see the differences – but why should I care? When I went through my master’s degree studies, it became readily apparent of the differences between features and benefits. As my classmates would present their project or pitch, you began to understand which ones were compelling and which ones fell flat. The distinguishing characteristic, more often than not, was in the presenter’s understanding of features and benefits. Let’s look at this more closely. Features are like the specifications on the side of the box or on the product website. Features are what distinguish one product from all others in its space. A feature-rich product is one that we think of as full of the latest bells and whistles, and is often what drives the price of the product. Features are what product and software developers get hung up on quite often, and are what the naive salesperson pitches to their prospects. Lots of product packaging and advertising is consumed by the list of features. See our page on Features of Scrum. Benefits, on the other hand, are often not spelled out on a product’s label. Benefits, more than anything else, are what will compel a potential client or user to purchase a particular product. It is the overall value that they will derive from their experience with that product. For consumer-based products, the vast majority of manufacturers leave it to the purchaser to establish their own list of benefits. Quite often, all they have to gauge their assessment on is the list of features. If the consumer cannot understand what the feature does for them, then no benefit is perceived. The seasoned sales professional finds out what their customer wants and maps the features of their product to the benefits that the customer seeks. Check out out page on Benefits of Scrum. As a product owner on an Agile team, if you do not understand who your customer is, then you will have a hard time connecting features and benefits to their needs. That is why it is vital to know your customer and know their needs so that you can decide what goes in the product. Fortunately in Agile, there is a tool to help us accomplish just that – the user story. A good set of user stories make the connection between the features and benefits. User stories are in the form of “As a [role], I want [goal] so I can [reason].” For purposes of this blog, let’s rewrite this template as follows: “As a [customer], I want [feature] so I can [benefit].” This is critical to a successful product development process. You have to know why your customer might buy something before deciding what feature set to include in the product. Don’t overlook this critical component of the Agile process. Create good user stories and during your sprint reviews you’ll be able to connect features and benefits to the delight your customer.

It primarily focuses on children education, their career goals, and extra-curricular activities. Regardless of their current income levels, parents often aspire to give their children the very best. But, due to the rising inflation costs, advanced lifestyle behavior and higher education costs, choosing a sound child plan becomes mandatory for parents. Funding for your child’s secure future is the most important part. It could be the best asset parents can give to their child/children. With the costs of higher education shooting up, fixed income return options are unlikely to help you save for your child’s future. You need to aim for equity returns. People usually save either for retirement or with a specific goal in mind. But the most important goals is your child’s future like education or marriage, while other goals are kept on a hold. This article focuses on the child’s future goals. Planning a child’s education could be a challenge, especially when you don’t even know which stream she or he would pursue. Child plans offered by life insurance companies are one of the most preferred forms of investment for child’s financial security. The two important aspects while buying a plan for your children would be cover protection and the best investment returns from the market. Let’s understand child-insurance plan offered by insurance companies:\nChild Insurance plans are insurance-cum-investment plans offered by insurance companies. In these plans, the parent starts investing right from the time a child is born. They can withdraw the savings once the child reaches adulthood or in exceptional cases, if the parent were to meet with an unfortunate event child insurance plan is able to provide a life cover for the financial needs of your children and lump-sum money is paid out to the child as well. Child-oriented life insurances offer a waiver of premium option under which future premiums are paid by the insurer if the parent dies or contracts a critical illness. Many times parents delay the planning for child security may be due to lack of sufficient funds or some other financial responsibilities. But the truth is the more you delay the child plan, lesser would be the finances arranged for your child safety in future. Therefore, industry experts suggest parents start early and follow a disciplined approach to saving for these child insurance plans. While there are some ways to buy child plans like calling up customer service, visiting branch or handing over the job to an insurance agent, the best way would be purchasing it online. Buying child insurance plan online proves to be the most convenient and hassle-free method in the modern day times. Besides, it gives an edge over other financial products, owing to a wide range of benefits. Child plans allows parents to start investing early and motivates for more streamlined efforts towards savings for their children. They are affordable and based on individual risk appetite, income sources and child’s future needs. Customers can choose between unit-linked and traditional insurance plans. While a unit linked child insurance policy allows investment in equity and debt markets, the traditional child insurance offers guaranteed maturity benefits and invest funds mainly in self-instruments and risk-free government securities. Low-risk appetite people can opt for traditional policies and customers ready to take the risk for their children can take a look at the equity markets.Also See: Child Insurance, Insurance Plans, Childs Future, Insurance Plan, Plans, Insurance, FutureTop Searches - Trending Searches - New Articles - Top Articles - Trending Articles - Featured Articles - Top Members\nCopyright © 2019 Uberant.com564,244 total articles and counting.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:3787e058-8ecd-4cd0-8f7f-d9e0b1731b27>']}, {'passage': 'What is a Product? “Product is anything that can be offered to someone to satisfy a need or a want.”-Philip Kotler. What are Product Features? Product features are defined as a product’s traits or attributes that deliver value to end-users or customers. When it comes to software, product features can include any softwares functionalities, capabilities, and even its visual characteristics are known as the user interface. But the main trait of any product feature is the value it delivers to a customer. Difference between Features vs benefits ? Features refer to the specific functionalities, characteristics, or properties of the product or service. These are the tangible and measurable aspects of what the product or service can do or offer. For example, the features of a smartphone might include a high-resolution camera, a large storage capacity, and a fast processor. Benefits, on the other hand, refer to the positive outcomes or advantages that the user or customer will experience from using the product or service. Benefits are often intangible and emotional, and they focus on how the product or service can improve the customer\'s life or solve a problem. For example, the benefits of a smartphone might include the ability to capture high-quality photos, stay connected with friends and family, and access information quickly and easily. How to prioritize Product Features? Feature prioritization is the process of deciding which features to implement first. It determines which features should be implemented first to maximize the product\'s value. Prioritizing product features can be a complex process, but here are some general steps you can follow:\nIdentify the problem your product is solving: Start by understanding the problem your product is solving and the value it brings to your target market. Define your product vision: Create a product vision statement that outlines the key benefits and features of your product. Gather customer feedback: Collect feedback from your customers or potential customers through surveys, interviews, and user testing to identify the features that are most important to them. Analyze data: Analyze data on how customers are currently using your product and what features are being used the most. Prioritize features based on impact and effort: Use a prioritization framework such as the ""MoSCoW method"" (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won\'t-have) or ""RICE"" (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) to prioritize features based on their potential impact and the effort required to implement them. Set goals: Set clear goals for each feature, including what problem it solves, what benefit it brings, and what metrics you will use to measure its success. Review and adjust: Regularly review and adjust your feature prioritization based on customer feedback, market changes, and other factors that may impact your product\'s success.

                ""text"": ""The Canada Child Benefit (formerly the Canada Child Tax Benefit) is a tax-free monthly payment from the federal government intended to help families manage the costs of raising their kids. If you currently receive CCB payments, you likely qualify for a Magical Credit cash loan! Magical Credit provides short-term cash loans to most people receiving income from the federal and provincial government on a monthly basis, with fewer restrictions and hoops to jump through than anyone else in the industry. While there are a number of so-called \u201cbaby bonuses\u201d paid out to families by various levels of government, the federal Canada Child Benefit is the largest and best-known. Introduced in 1989 as the Canada Child Tax Benefit, the CCB was designed with the intention of reducing rising child poverty rates, particularly in urban areas and remote communities. Families and single parents of children under 18 years of age must apply for the CCB in order to receive their monthly payments, which are administered by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). The CRA uses information from each caregiver\u2019s tax returns, as well as the number of children in the household, to calculate the family\u2019s benefit amounts. For families earning less than $30,000 per year, the CCB will pay out $6,400 per year for each child under the age of six. For children six to 17, this amount is reduced to $5,400 per year. In addition, families of children with a physical or mental disability can receive $2,730 per year under the Child Disability Benefit (CDB). The exact amount families earning over $30,000 per year will receive varies, with most households in the over $150,000 bracket receiving little to no direct benefit from the program. In order to be eligible for the CCB, you must meet the following criteria:\nAs noted previously, the CCB is administered by the Canada Revenue Agency, so you\u2019ll have to have been diligent about submitting your annual tax returns! If you are in good standing with the CRA, you will have a much easier time applying to receive benefits. If you are eligible, applying for the CCB is a simple process. The Canadian government offers the option of applying when you complete your newborn\u2019s birth registration via the Automated Benefits Application. You can also register online via your CRA account, or by filing an RC66 form with your tax return. These days, most payments from the CRA are directly deposited into your bank account, which is also a requirement to qualify for a cash loan based on your CCB. Because your CCB payments (and most provincial equivalents) are calculated based upon household income, any amounts which can be deducted from the net income you report on your taxes will go toward increasing your family\u2019s baby bonuses. You should keep receipts related to costs like moving, medical treatment, union dues and (most pertinently) child care in order to write them off as expenses. Parents can write off as much as... Here are a few examples of deductible child care fees:\nAnother great tip is to maximize your RRSP contributions. As RRSP contributions are not counted as taxable income, you can put more money toward the future while improving your chances of receiving a higher baby bonus. Remember, Canada Child Benefits aren\u2019t taxable income; knowing what you can write off, therefore, amounts to free money, which can make a huge difference when finances are tight. Although the original Canada Child Tax Benefit (CCTB) was introduced all the way back in 1989, its current form can be traced to 2016 when the new Liberal government unveiled sweeping changes intended to simplify and enhance its payouts to lower-income families. Besides the CCTB, there was also the Harper-era Universal Child Care Benefit (UCCB), and the National Child Benefit (NCB) supplement for lower-income families, as well as a number of more niche credits for kids\u2019 fitness and the arts. The CCB has effectively replaced all of these programs, rolling the various payouts into a single stream. This decision simplifies matters for beneficiaries, as some of these previous benefits were tax-free while others counted as income. The CCB also has the benefit of reducing some of the CRA\u2019s administrative load. The Canada Child Benefit is just one of numerous benefits for families in Canada. Almost every province and territory offers its own payments and tax breaks for parents, which can help supplement the support families receive from the federal government. It can get a little confusing though, as every province calculates benefits a different way."",

                ""text"": ""The Childcare Voucher Scheme is a UK government initiative aimed at helping working parents to benefit from tax efficiencies in order to save money on childcare. The scheme is offered by many employers as a salary sacrifice scheme and implemented through the employer\u2019s payroll. This means that parents who are in the scheme are able to sacrifice part of their salary (Tax and National Insurance free) in order to obtain childcare vouchers of an equal amount up to specified limits. The employer also saves money because the amount each parent sacrifices from their salary is exempt from employers\u2019 National Insurance Contributions. Employers can offer the scheme themselves or by using one of the voucher companies to do the administration for them. The fees these companies charge should be less than the savings the employer makes on National Insurance. Employers may also benefit from having a happier workforce and seeing a reduction in staff turnover. Basic rate taxpayers can pay for up to \u00a3243 of childcare with vouchers each month. This can lead to an annual Tax and NI saving of up to \u00a3930 per parent. Higher rate tax payers can pay up to \u00a3121 per month and top rate tax players can pay up to \u00a3108 per month. The higher and top rate restrictions only apply to those who joined the scheme on or after 6 April 2011. These vouchers can be used for any nursery, playgroup, nanny, childcare or au pair who is an Ofsted registered provider. These vouchers can be saved up by parents but are non-refundable. New Tax-Free Childcare Scheme from Autumn 2015\nFrom Autumn 2015 Tax-Free childcare will be available to nearly 2 million households to help with the cost of childcare, enabling more parents to go out to work. Unlike the childcare voucher scheme the new Tax-Free childcare scheme will not be available to parents who have a stay at home partner. The new Tax-free childcare scheme will give a 20% tax break to cover annual childcare costs of up to \u00a310,000, providing savings of up to \u00a32,000 per child. Parents will be able to register and open an online account for the new Tax-Free childcare scheme by going to the GOV.UK website. Parents and others can then pay money into their childcare account as and when they like. They will also be able to withdraw money if they want. The scheme will be available for children up to age of 12 (or children with disabilities up to the age of 17). To qualify parents will have to be in work, earning just over an average of \u00a350 a week and not more than \u00a3150,000 per year. Any eligible working family can use the Tax-Free childcare scheme as it does not rely on employers offering it. Unlike the current scheme, self-employed parents can use the Tax-Free childcare scheme. Parents who sign up to the current childcare voucher scheme will be able to remain in the scheme and will not be disadvantaged by the proposed 2015 changes. However after Autumn 2015 the childcare voucher scheme will no longer be available for new entrants. The new arrangement will not provide any National Insurance savings for employers (currently worth up to 12% for basic-rate taxpayers). Parents who sign up to the current childcare voucher scheme will be able to remain in the scheme. However, if they move to a new employer after Autumn 2015, they will be considered to have left the current scheme and be forced to switch to the new arrangements. In general families with high childcare costs will be better off under the Tax-Free childcare scheme while families with low childcare costs will be better off remaining under the Childcare Voucher Scheme."",

                ""text"": ""As any working parents will attest, the cost of childcare for a baby or child up to the age of five is very expensive. In fact for many families, the costs are shockingly often more than their monthly mortgage or rent!!! So, being able to help your employees with the cost of their childcare can make a significant difference to their family finances, not to mention their return to work decision. Currently the Childcare Voucher benefit system allows you to help your employees to meet these costs. But as of April 2018 this will change and the scheme will be closed to new joiners. After this date no new employees will be able to receive Childcare Vouchers, only existing employees already receiving them will be able to continue with the scheme. So post 2018, as an employer how can you help your employees with their childcare costs? The answer: WORKPLACE NURSERY BENEFIT\nHow does Workplace Nursery Benefit work? Quite simply, it allows your employees to offset their full monthly nursery fees against tax and NI savings. Currently, there is no capped amount, so a parent paying \u00a31,800 per month in nursery costs would save \u00a35,443 (Figure based on eligibility and nursery costs) a year compared with just \u00a3933 with Childcare Vouchers. Savings this big are the equivalent of a pay rise! This benefit will help you attract new employees whilst also helping your existing employees with their rising costs of nursery care. The Workplace Nursery Benefit costs you nothing to implement or administer. In fact, in many cases the benefit can provide your business with a saving in NI contributions. If you would like to discuss anything to do with Childcare Vouchers or how to implement the Workplace Nursery Scheme, give HR Revolution a call +44 203 538 5311 or email: email@example.com, we\u2019d love to help."",

I mean, what the heck are you supposed to do with that, right? Am I right?! Well, let’s make sure this never happens to you again. Here’s the ONE tool you need to solve all your online shopping woes: Lucky for you, you can find it on Amazon, in practically any big box store (Target, Walmart, Kmart), or in an arts and crafts store in your neighborhood, and it’ll cost you a few dollars at most. How is tailor’s tape going to solve all my online shopping woes? This little tool can measure every single square inch of that hot bod of yours. And those measurements are exactly what you need to make those confusing online purchases much easier. I don’t want to measure every square inch of my body. Okay, fine. I was over-exaggerating anyway. You really only need 6, maybe 7, measurements. That’s it! With those 6 (or 7) measurements, you can buy any garment anywhere without having to try it on. Pretty nifty, right? So what parts of my body should I measure? Good question. To make it easy, why not take a look at this handy dandy diagram below: Here are some descriptive definitions for the more confusing ones: Sleeve length: Measure from the base of the neck, across the traps to the shoulder, down the arm, to your wrist bone. Chest: Measure the widest part of your chest, usually across the nipples (ooh la la). Natural waist: Your natural waist is generally where your torso bends if you were to stand straight with your legs shoulder width apart, and tipped over slightly to one side. That crease sorta in the middle of your ribs? That’s your natural waist. Hip: Where your pants typically sit. If you finger that area (wow, really?) you can feel your hip bone. Your tape should come right across there, parallel to the ground. Inseam: Measure from the inside of your thigh (this is too much) to the heel. These are the only measurements you’ll need. Some tips on getting an accurate measurement This is a little difficult to do if you’re on your own, unless you have something like this. If you’re not as fancy and you picked up traditional tailor’s tape, better get your patient significant other to help you out. Keep the tape straight It’s really important to make sure the tape is level as your S.O. is wrapping it around your body parts (whoa). If it isn’t straight, chances are you’ll get a skewed measurement. An inch can make a big difference in the fit of your clothes, so make sure your designated measurer is as precise as possible. If you’re measuring your chest, waist, or hips, the tape should be parallel to the ground. Too loose = bad You want to feel the tape wrapped around you. If it’s too loose, most likely it’s also not straight, so you’re going to get an inaccurate measurement no matter what. Too tight = bad Yes, you want to feel the tape wrapped around you, but you don’t want to cinch it so snugly that your spare tire is cascading over it, enveloping the tape in a wall of skin and lard like some weird 80s horror film.

The tape should be firm but not too tight - you want to feel it against your body without cinching it so snugly that it causes bulging.

1. **Neck**: Measure around the neck where a collar would sit, just below the Adam's apple. The tape should be level and snug, but not tight.

2. **Bust (for women)**: Place the measuring tape at the fullest part of the bust, keeping it parallel to the floor. For men and kids, measure around the center of the chest.

3. **Waist**: Find the narrowest part of your waist, usually just above the belly button. Wrap the tape around this area, keeping it parallel to the floor.

4. **Hips**: Measure the fullest part of the hips, which is typically at the widest part of the buttocks. The tape should be parallel to the floor.

5. **Sleeve Length**: Measure from the center back of the neck, over the shoulder, down the arm, and to the wrist bone.

7. **Length**: For the length of a garment, measure from the base of the neck (for tops and dresses) or from the waist (for skirts) to the desired length on the body.

Remember to breathe normally while taking measurements, and avoid pulling the tape too tight or too loose. It's also helpful to have someone assist you, especially for measurements that require you to stand straight or bend your arms. Consistency is key, so try to measure at the same time of day and in similar clothing (if applicable) to get the most accurate results.","You are a helpful assistant.

### Context: If you’re into online shopping, knowing your body measurements is a necessity to getting clothes in the right sizes. J.Crew sizing is different from H&M sizing, and retailers can even be inconsistent across their own line. Sizing inconsistencies can be attributed to different fabrics, updated cuts of products bearing the same name, and even vanity sizing. When taking your measurements, be sure to use a cloth measuring tape (or other options that we recommend in the absence of one) — not a metal measuring tape. This will ensure that you’re measuring your body accurately. In addition, measure only over bare skin or skin-tight clothes so as to ensure the most accurate measurements. What You Should Measure
Chest or Bust
This measurement is used for tops and dresses. Women: Place one end of the tape measure at the fullest part of your bust and wrap it around your body to get the measurement, keeping the tape parallel to the floor. Men and kids: Place one end of the tape measure at the center of your chest. Wrap it around your body, keeping the tape parallel to the floor. Bras are sized using a unique system based on two measurements of the bust area. For detailed instructions on how to measure to determine bra size and get a correct fit, please see: How to Measure for a Bra. This measurement is used for tops, dresses, and bottoms. Most clothing lines use the measurement of the “natural waist” for their size guides. To measure your natural waist, you want to find the narrowest part of your waist, located above your belly button and below your rib cage. Note some brands use a “low” waist measurement. For this, you would measure at the point where your trousers would normally ride.

How to Measure Your Body: Neck Around
Place the measuring tape around the neck at the height where the collar would normally rest. This will be just below your Adam’s apple. Stand relaxed. Do not crane your neck out or squeeze your chin down. The tape should be resting lightly on the skin, not squeezing it. Hold one finger under the tape measure to ensure some room for comfort. Do not try to account for shrinkage by adding extra here. We will do that for you.

There are three body measurement points that you need to know to ensure a great fit – bust, waist, and hips. When taking your body measurements, wear the undergarments you normally wear for the most accurate results. Use a flexible tape measure, or a piece of string and ruler, and hold it around each body point so it is comfortably snug. If the tape is cutting into your flesh, it is too tight. To ensure an accurate measurement around your body, keep the measuring tape as level as possible from front to back. We recommend measuring yourself in front of a mirror so you can check this from a side view. If you can, get a friend to help you to ensure the most accurate measurements. Bust: Wrap the measuring tape around your back and where the tape meets across the fullest point of your bust is your bust measurement. Waist: Wrap the measuring tape around your natural waist, the slimmest part of your torso, pulling the ends to the front. Where they meet is your waist measurement. Hips: Wrap the measuring tape around the widest part of your bottom – this is usually low down towards your thighs. As with your bust and waist measurements, where the tape meets is your hip measurement. Length: To measure the length of individual garments against your body it is best to measure down the centre of your back. To do this, start the measuring tape at either the base of your neck for dresses and tops, or at your waist for skirts. Measure down your body to the measurement listed in the garment description. This will show you where the garment comes to on you. When you are measuring for length, remember to make sure you are standing completely upright – it is best to have someone help you with this. Alternatively, compare the measurement with the length of a garment you already have.

Before making any dress, you need to first take the necessary body measurements of the person who will wear the outfit. If you are making your own dress, you need to take your own measurements. If you are dressmaking for another person, you need to schedule a session so you can take the necessary and important body measurements. You should include the necessary measurement tools in your dressmaking kit. The basic tool for measuring sizes is a tape measure. You can use a nylon or plastic tape measure for the purpose. Use the English standard measurement (i.e. inches). Before proceeding to measure anyone, be sure the person is not wearing bulky outfit. Advise the person to come wearing well-fitted undergarments. This is because oversized underwear may drastically affect the accuracy of measurements. For women, bras should fit well, and for men, boxers and other loose underwear should not be worn when in the session. Make the person to be measured stand correctly and in good body posture. He or she should stand proudly, with eyes gazing straight ahead and both arms very relaxed at either side. The back should be ideally straight and shoulders in a relaxed state. Some people do not naturally stand this proud, but advise the person you are measuring to observe correct and proud standing for the sake of getting accurate and ideal body measurements. There is a need to take a good position base. When finally measuring, take note that the job does not end in measuring the bust, the waist, and the hips. Other body areas should also be measured correctly. There can be differences in procedures when measuring men and women, but there are general body areas to scale. • To measure the chest, put the tape measure under the person’s arms. Wrap the tape measure around the area, specifically to the fullest bust line part. • To measure the waist line, put the measuring tape at the person’s belly button. Let the tool fall naturally. The area where it fell is the waist line, the measurement you should take. • Measure the fullest part of the person’s hip. • To measure the arm length, place the tape measure at the top of the arm in the armpit area extending until the wrist. Bend the arm without taking off the tape. Take the measurement as the arm length. • Take back length measurement after determining the length from the base of the neck until the waistline. • Measure the length from hip to heel to get the accurate leg measurement. In taking measurements before dressmaking, it is a standard practice to measure the areas thrice in one session. There might be differences resulting from changes in positions and starting points of measurements. There is a need to do so to ensure measurement accuracy.

The best way is to find a freckle and use it every time. LOL! That's what I do. For record keeping, what matters most is consistency. As for measuring for clothing, I have no idea. I'm bad about the waist and the hips. Proper ""hip"" measurement for me seems more like my butt, not my hips. My hip bones are a lot higher than where I think my hips must actually be. Dr. Oz wants us to have a waist size of 32 or smaller and he allows for sucking in. I do not suck in, but that's just me. And I like to pull the tape pretty tight only because that way I can't second guess the way I do it each time. If I'm always pulling really tight then it's the same every time.

It can be helpful to know your measurements before you go show-clothes shopping. By Samantha Eckert
If you do decide to shop, make it easier on yourself by knowing your measurements before you try on or order show clothes. With show clothing, it is important that everything fits correctly. If something is too tight or loose, it can compromise your overall appearance in the show pen. Buy a flexible measuring tape from your local craft or fabric store for the most accurate numbers. When measuring yourself, wear the same undergarments that you show in. Enlist the help of a friend to take the most accurate measurements. Be sure to write them all down and keep them with you while you are shopping. Learn Nicole Barnes’ secrets to perfect showmanship patterns in AQHA’s FREE Showmanship Basics report! Where to Measure
The basic measurements women will need to find a well-fitted jacket are: waist, bust, neck, hips, front width and back waist. It is important when measuring to not pull to tightly on the measuring tape. This is called a skin measurement. Stand relaxed, but with good posture. Start with your waist. Your natural waist is located between the bottom of your ribcage and your pelvis. This is the smallest part of your abdomen. Keep the tape parallel to the ground. Next, move to your bust. When measuring your bust, stand with your arms at about a 45 degree angle away from your body. Measure across the fullest part of the breasts, tape parallel to the floor. Your bust is not the same thing as your chest. In addition to Nicole’s secrets, Brad and Valerie Kearns explain why showmanship is the perfect event for people who can’t afford an expensive horse in AQHA’s FREE Showmanship Basics report. To measure your chest, stand with your arms in the same position as before and place the measuring tape around your back and under your armpits. The tape should go above the breasts and be pulled a little snug. Measure your neck to find the height most comfortable for a collar. Measure the base of your neck, not the middle, to find the circumference. To find the height put the measuring tape at the indentation at the front of your neck up to where it would feel comfortable for a collar to rest. Measure the length of your arm. Place the measuring tape at the tip of your shoulder, or sleeve seam, down to where the wrist bends. It is best to add an inch or more to allow for movement while riding. Your front width is from the crease where the arm meets the body to the crease on the other side, above the breasts and not across the fullest part. The arc of your bust is from the side seam of your top or shirt to the other side seam, across the fullest part of your breasts. Your back waist will help determine the length of your jacket. To measure your back waist, put the measuring tape at the nape of your neck. Then, measure the distance to where you would like your jacket to end. Showmanship jackets should end at the fullest part of your hips, anything longer will make your legs look short. Your hips are measured around the fullest part of your bottom with the tape parallel to the floor. For riding jackets you need to know where your chaps fit while you are mounted and riding. It is popular to have jackets that can be worn in multiple classes. If you are looking for a versatile jacket, be sure to know whether you want to wear it tucked in or left out while showing in riding classes. If you plan on wearing the jacket tucked in, be sure it is long enough that it will not un-tuck while riding and moving. If you plan on wearing the jacket un-tucked, it needs to fit over your chaps or hit just above them to show your belt buckle. Here are the top 24 photos we’ve picked for the AQHA calendar contest.

A slew of made-to-your-measurements, one-of-a-kind clothing brands and sites have been popping up recently (Christina knows what I’m talking about—she shared her favorite customizable under-$100 summer dresses earlier). While I’m intrigued by the idea of getting a dress that’s made to fit my body exactly, the idea of measuring myself at home before sending in the numbers makes me nervous. What if I do it wrong and eventually unwrap a package that’s not as spot-on as it should be? Because I’m certain someone out there shares these anxieties, I quizzed Anne Dayton, founder and CEO of PIOL Dress, a new company that offers a handful of timeless dress silhouettes in all kinds of colors and patterns. Along with the precise fit, you’re guided to find the one that matches your complexion best via a favorite trick of Edith Head, one of Hollywood’s most illustrious costumers. With her answers, below, I think both you and I are headed toward some very well fitting garments, indeed. Q: Is it best to take measurements nude or while wearing something simple like a t-shirt and jeans? A: We ask you to measure yourself in the bra and underwear you’d most likely wear with the dress. Q: For the bust measurement, bra on or off? A: Definitely in your bra and, if possible, the one you’re most likely to be wearing with the dress. Q: In the ideal situation, should we ask a best friend to measure us rather than trying to do it ourselves? A: If you can ask someone to do it, that would be great. Otherwise, measure yourself in front of a full-length mirror to be sure the tape is parallel to the floor in the back. If the measuring tape isn’t even as it goes around your figure, the measurements could be off. Q: Are there any common mistakes people make when using a measuring tape? A: The most common mistake is to measure your high hip rather than your hip at their fullest point. The other one is to give us your bra size as the bust measurement—it’s not the same measurement at all. Q: Does it matter if measurements are taken first thing in the morning or at the end of the day? A: We haven’t really examined the difference of your measurements from morning to night. As you’ll be wearing the dress throughout the day, I’d imagine mid-day is the optimum time for measuring. Q: Real talk: Should we be trying to measure the “best” version of ourselves—standing up tall and straight with shoulders down and stomach in—or just how we typically stand? A: Standing straight, tall, and with feet together is the most desirable position. The one measurement that can move is the waistline. It’s very important that you breathe while measuring your waist, rather than holding in your breath or stomach. Our tailored style dress is very fitted in the bodice and waist, and if you measure your waist while holding your stomach in, the waistband could be too snug. One of the beauties of a custom-made dress is that it can be fitted to your figure, [but] still a pleasure to wear. Q: So fibbing numbers at all, for any reason, is a horrible idea? A: We truly need your real measurements. If you fib, the dress will be too tight and probably in the wrong places. If parts of the dress are too tight, you’re actually calling attention to that area. In terms of comfort, we’ve [considered that with] all our silhouettes, so there’s never a need to add to your measurements.","[{'passage': 'If you’re into online shopping, knowing your body measurements is a necessity to getting clothes in the right sizes. J.Crew sizing is different from H&M sizing, and retailers can even be inconsistent across their own line. Sizing inconsistencies can be attributed to different fabrics, updated cuts of products bearing the same name, and even vanity sizing. When taking your measurements, be sure to use a cloth measuring tape (or other options that we recommend in the absence of one) — not a metal measuring tape. This will ensure that you’re measuring your body accurately. In addition, measure only over bare skin or skin-tight clothes so as to ensure the most accurate measurements. What You Should Measure\nChest or Bust\nThis measurement is used for tops and dresses. Women: Place one end of the tape measure at the fullest part of your bust and wrap it around your body to get the measurement, keeping the tape parallel to the floor. Men and kids: Place one end of the tape measure at the center of your chest. Wrap it around your body, keeping the tape parallel to the floor. Bras are sized using a unique system based on two measurements of the bust area. For detailed instructions on how to measure to determine bra size and get a correct fit, please see: How to Measure for a Bra. This measurement is used for tops, dresses, and bottoms. Most clothing lines use the measurement of the “natural waist” for their size guides. To measure your natural waist, you want to find the narrowest part of your waist, located above your belly button and below your rib cage. Note some brands use a “low” waist measurement. For this, you would measure at the point where your trousers would normally ride.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:3d5684ae-9092-4eb3-a6a5-6d59b6bcc886>']}, {'passage': 'How to Measure Your Body: Neck Around\nPlace the measuring tape around the neck at the height where the collar would normally rest. This will be just below your Adam’s apple. Stand relaxed. Do not crane your neck out or squeeze your chin down. The tape should be resting lightly on the skin, not squeezing it.

When taking your body measurements, wear the undergarments you normally wear for the most accurate results. Use a flexible tape measure, or a piece of string and ruler, and hold it around each body point so it is comfortably snug. If the tape is cutting into your flesh, it is too tight. To ensure an accurate measurement around your body, keep the measuring tape as level as possible from front to back. We recommend measuring yourself in front of a mirror so you can check this from a side view. If you can, get a friend to help you to ensure the most accurate measurements. Bust: Wrap the measuring tape around your back and where the tape meets across the fullest point of your bust is your bust measurement. Waist: Wrap the measuring tape around your natural waist, the slimmest part of your torso, pulling the ends to the front. Where they meet is your waist measurement. Hips: Wrap the measuring tape around the widest part of your bottom – this is usually low down towards your thighs. As with your bust and waist measurements, where the tape meets is your hip measurement. Length: To measure the length of individual garments against your body it is best to measure down the centre of your back. To do this, start the measuring tape at either the base of your neck for dresses and tops, or at your waist for skirts. Measure down your body to the measurement listed in the garment description. This will show you where the garment comes to on you. When you are measuring for length, remember to make sure you are standing completely upright – it is best to have someone help you with this. Alternatively, compare the measurement with the length of a garment you already have.

If you are making your own dress, you need to take your own measurements. If you are dressmaking for another person, you need to schedule a session so you can take the necessary and important body measurements. You should include the necessary measurement tools in your dressmaking kit. The basic tool for measuring sizes is a tape measure. You can use a nylon or plastic tape measure for the purpose. Use the English standard measurement (i.e. inches). Before proceeding to measure anyone, be sure the person is not wearing bulky outfit. Advise the person to come wearing well-fitted undergarments. This is because oversized underwear may drastically affect the accuracy of measurements. For women, bras should fit well, and for men, boxers and other loose underwear should not be worn when in the session. Make the person to be measured stand correctly and in good body posture. He or she should stand proudly, with eyes gazing straight ahead and both arms very relaxed at either side. The back should be ideally straight and shoulders in a relaxed state. Some people do not naturally stand this proud, but advise the person you are measuring to observe correct and proud standing for the sake of getting accurate and ideal body measurements. There is a need to take a good position base. When finally measuring, take note that the job does not end in measuring the bust, the waist, and the hips. Other body areas should also be measured correctly. There can be differences in procedures when measuring men and women, but there are general body areas to scale. • To measure the chest, put the tape measure under the person’s arms. Wrap the tape measure around the area, specifically to the fullest bust line part. • To measure the waist line, put the measuring tape at the person’s belly button. Let the tool fall naturally. The area where it fell is the waist line, the measurement you should take. • Measure the fullest part of the person’s hip. • To measure the arm length, place the tape measure at the top of the arm in the armpit area extending until the wrist. Bend the arm without taking off the tape. Take the measurement as the arm length. • Take back length measurement after determining the length from the base of the neck until the waistline. • Measure the length from hip to heel to get the accurate leg measurement. In taking measurements before dressmaking, it is a standard practice to measure the areas thrice in one session. There might be differences resulting from changes in positions and starting points of measurements.

If the measuring tape isn’t even as it goes around your figure, the measurements could be off. Q: Are there any common mistakes people make when using a measuring tape? A: The most common mistake is to measure your high hip rather than your hip at their fullest point. The other one is to give us your bra size as the bust measurement—it’s not the same measurement at all. Q: Does it matter if measurements are taken first thing in the morning or at the end of the day? A: We haven’t really examined the difference of your measurements from morning to night. As you’ll be wearing the dress throughout the day, I’d imagine mid-day is the optimum time for measuring. Q: Real talk: Should we be trying to measure the “best” version of ourselves—standing up tall and straight with shoulders down and stomach in—or just how we typically stand? A: Standing straight, tall, and with feet together is the most desirable position. The one measurement that can move is the waistline. It’s very important that you breathe while measuring your waist, rather than holding in your breath or stomach. Our tailored style dress is very fitted in the bodice and waist, and if you measure your waist while holding your stomach in, the waistband could be too snug. One of the beauties of a custom-made dress is that it can be fitted to your figure, [but] still a pleasure to wear. Q: So fibbing numbers at all, for any reason, is a horrible idea? A: We truly need your real measurements. If you fib, the dress will be too tight and probably in the wrong places. If parts of the dress are too tight, you’re actually calling attention to that area. In terms of comfort, we’ve [considered that with] all our silhouettes, so there’s never a need to add to your measurements.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:9acdd04d-4522-4035-8c3e-51281bebee16>']}]","{

                ""text"": ""Before making any dress, you need to first take the necessary body measurements of the person who will wear the outfit. If you are making your own dress, you need to take your own measurements. If you are dressmaking for another person, you need to schedule a session so you can take the necessary and important body measurements. You should include the necessary measurement tools in your dressmaking kit. The basic tool for measuring sizes is a tape measure. You can use a nylon or plastic tape measure for the purpose. Use the English standard measurement (i.e. inches). Before proceeding to measure anyone, be sure the person is not wearing bulky outfit. Advise the person to come wearing well-fitted undergarments. This is because oversized underwear may drastically affect the accuracy of measurements. For women, bras should fit well, and for men, boxers and other loose underwear should not be worn when in the session. Make the person to be measured stand correctly and in good body posture. He or she should stand proudly, with eyes gazing straight ahead and both arms very relaxed at either side. The back should be ideally straight and shoulders in a relaxed state. Some people do not naturally stand this proud, but advise the person you are measuring to observe correct and proud standing for the sake of getting accurate and ideal body measurements. There is a need to take a good position base. When finally measuring, take note that the job does not end in measuring the bust, the waist, and the hips. Other body areas should also be measured correctly. There can be differences in procedures when measuring men and women, but there are general body areas to scale. \u2022 To measure the chest, put the tape measure under the person\u2019s arms. Wrap the tape measure around the area, specifically to the fullest bust line part. \u2022 To measure the waist line, put the measuring tape at the person\u2019s belly button. Let the tool fall naturally. The area where it fell is the waist line, the measurement you should take. \u2022 Measure the fullest part of the person\u2019s hip. \u2022 To measure the arm length, place the tape measure at the top of the arm in the armpit area extending until the wrist. Bend the arm without taking off the tape. Take the measurement as the arm length. \u2022 Take back length measurement after determining the length from the base of the neck until the waistline. \u2022 Measure the length from hip to heel to get the accurate leg measurement. In taking measurements before dressmaking, it is a standard practice to measure the areas thrice in one session. There might be differences resulting from changes in positions and starting points of measurements. There is a need to do so to ensure measurement accuracy."",

                ""text"": ""If you\u2019re into online shopping, knowing your body measurements is a necessity to getting clothes in the right sizes. J.Crew sizing is different from H&M sizing, and retailers can even be inconsistent across their own line. Sizing inconsistencies can be attributed to different fabrics, updated cuts of products bearing the same name, and even vanity sizing. When taking your measurements, be sure to use a cloth measuring tape (or other options that we recommend in the absence of one) \u2014 not a metal measuring tape. This will ensure that you\u2019re measuring your body accurately. In addition, measure only over bare skin or skin-tight clothes so as to ensure the most accurate measurements. What You Should Measure\nChest or Bust\nThis measurement is used for tops and dresses. Women: Place one end of the tape measure at the fullest part of your bust and wrap it around your body to get the measurement, keeping the tape parallel to the floor. Men and kids: Place one end of the tape measure at the center of your chest. Wrap it around your body, keeping the tape parallel to the floor. Bras are sized using a unique system based on two measurements of the bust area. For detailed instructions on how to measure to determine bra size and get a correct fit, please see: How to Measure for a Bra. This measurement is used for tops, dresses, and bottoms. Most clothing lines use the measurement of the \u201cnatural waist\u201d for their size guides. To measure your natural waist, you want to find the narrowest part of your waist, located above your belly button and below your rib cage. Note some brands use a \u201clow\u201d waist measurement. For this, you would measure at the point where your trousers would normally ride."",

                ""text"": ""While my previous article talked about when you can expect to see workout results. I felt it was also important to provide you with an easy to use body measurement tracking chart to keep track of your results and exactly how to use it. You can download the body measurement tracking chart in an easy-to-print .pdf file here. If you\u2019re more interested in keeping track of your measurements on your computer, I\u2019ve also created a measurement chart in excel that can be downloaded here. What You Need to Take Your Measurements\nDon\u2019t worry\u2026taking body part measurements is super easy. All you need is a flexible tape measure (fabric, not metal!) and a method to track your results like one of my above measurement trackers. You can find fabric tape measures at almost any art & craft or fabric store near you. A partner to lend a hand is also a great help, they can make sure you are measuring in the same spot on both sides of your body, make sure the tape measure is level all the way around, they can also help measure some of the the harder to reach spots. Optionally, a one hand tape measure made specifically for taking body measurements like the Perfect Waist Tape is great for when you can\u2019t get assistance. These are very accurate and simple to use. I keep mine tucked away with my other workout equipment which means no more \u201cHave you seen the fabric tape measure\u201d on Sundays. Where to Make Your Measurements\nWhen taking your measurements, you need to measure with the same tightness and same spot each and every time \u2013 otherwise, you are not going to get accurate readings. The measuring tape should neither be too tight nor too loose \u2013 what you should be going for is just taut. If skin is starting to bulge out from over and under the tape measure, you are measuring too tight, and if it\u2019s moving around freely, you don\u2019t have it tight enough. Here are the body parts you should always measure and how to measure them properly:\n- Neck \u2013 Measure around the smallest part of your neck. - Chest\u2013 Measure around the fullest part of your bust, under your armpits and around your shoulder blades. - Arms \u2013 Measure around the largest part of your arms (flexed or not flexed, just make sure to do it the same every week.) - Waist \u2013 Measure around the smallest part of your waist, if you don\u2019t have a pronounced waistline and you\u2019re fairly straight, measure at the belly button. - Hips \u2013 Measure around the widest portion of your hips. - Thighs \u2013 Measure the circumference of the the fullest part of your thigh, usually about three inches from your crotch. - Calves \u2013 Measure around the largest part of your calf (flexed or not flexed, just do it the same each time). Why I Like Body Part Measurements Over the Scale\nMuscle weighs the same as fat but does not take up as much space(muscle tissue is more dense than fat tissue), which means you could lose a ton of fat and not lose much weight if you\u2019ve been putting on lean muscle mass. What commonly happens when people begin a new fitness program is they lose fat and replace it with muscle. This means the scale could remain the same even though you\u2019ve lost five pounds of fat and replaced it with five pounds of muscle. A good thing to always remember is this: losing inches is great tracker of success! Taking your body part measurements will let you know if you are building muscle and losing fat, while a scale only measure body weight is just not smart enough to figure that out. You\u2019ll know this by your body part measurements getting smaller while the scale number doesn\u2019t go down too much. This is how I was able to tell that BBL was really toning my body. Even though I would only lose a little more than a pound a week, if I was losing inches, I knew I was on the right track."",

                ""text"": ""How many times have you stumbled upon a sweet deal online but never completed the purchase because you couldn\u2019t figure out if the last one in your size would actually fit (and there were no returns, no exchanges)? Or have you ever found the perfect sport coat on eBay or Style Forum, but it didn\u2019t have size tags and the seller simply listed the measurements? I mean, what the heck are you supposed to do with that, right? Am I right?! Well, let\u2019s make sure this never happens to you again. Here\u2019s the ONE tool you need to solve all your online shopping woes:\nLucky for you, you can find it on Amazon, in practically any big box store (Target, Walmart, Kmart), or in an arts and crafts store in your neighborhood, and it\u2019ll cost you a few dollars at most. How is tailor\u2019s tape going to solve all my online shopping woes? This little tool can measure every single square inch of that hot bod of yours. And those measurements are exactly what you need to make those confusing online purchases much easier. I don\u2019t want to measure every square inch of my body. Okay, fine. I was over-exaggerating anyway. You really only need 6, maybe 7, measurements. That\u2019s it! With those 6 (or 7) measurements, you can buy any garment anywhere without having to try it on. Pretty nifty, right? So what parts of my body should I measure? Good question. To make it easy, why not take a look at this handy dandy diagram below:\nHere are some descriptive definitions for the more confusing ones:\nSleeve length: Measure from the base of the neck, across the traps to the shoulder, down the arm, to your wrist bone. Chest: Measure the widest part of your chest, usually across the nipples (ooh la la). Natural waist: Your natural waist is generally where your torso bends if you were to stand straight with your legs shoulder width apart, and tipped over slightly to one side. That crease sorta in the middle of your ribs? That\u2019s your natural waist. Hip: Where your pants typically sit. If you finger that area (wow, really?) you can feel your hip bone. Your tape should come right across there, parallel to the ground. Inseam: Measure from the inside of your thigh (this is too much) to the heel. These are the only measurements you\u2019ll need. Some tips on getting an accurate measurement\nThis is a little difficult to do if you\u2019re on your own, unless you have something like this. If you\u2019re not as fancy and you picked up traditional tailor\u2019s tape, better get your patient significant other to help you out. Keep the tape straight\nIt\u2019s really important to make sure the tape is level as your S.O. is wrapping it around your body parts (whoa). If it isn\u2019t straight, chances are you\u2019ll get a skewed measurement. An inch can make a big difference in the fit of your clothes, so make sure your designated measurer is as precise as possible. If you\u2019re measuring your chest, waist, or hips, the tape should be parallel to the ground. Too loose = bad\nYou want to feel the tape wrapped around you. If it\u2019s too loose, most likely it\u2019s also not straight, so you\u2019re going to get an inaccurate measurement no matter what. Too tight = bad\nYes, you want to feel the tape wrapped around you, but you don\u2019t want to cinch it so snugly that your spare tire is cascading over it, enveloping the tape in a wall of skin and lard like some weird 80s horror film. Keep it firm, but not tight. Line it up\nHold one end, wrap the tape around your body, hold it firm, and match up the free end to the nearest line on the tape, like so:\nPretty simple, right? You want to do this for each of the areas listed in my handy dandy diagram above. Half or full? Some places give you measurements that look peculiarly small. For example, you may see a garment listed as having a 20\u2033 chest measurement. Well that just means they measured across the chest without doubling the measurement. So your 40\u2033 chest is 40\u2033 because you went all the way around your body. While you\u2019re at it, measure your clothes\nLet\u2019s say you have a blazer that fits you perfectly. Take the jacket\u2019s measurements."",

A therapist helps patients identify their triggers and develop healthy coping mechanisms to prevent future episodes. How does TMS help alleviate depression? TMS uses non-invasive electromagnetic energy to stimulate the brain. Research on TMS and depression have found that the electromagnetic pulses, when applied to depressed areas of the brain, activates neurons thought to be responsible for depression symptoms. Why would someone choose TMS Along with medication? Medications are often the first line of defense in treating depression. Most patients will respond favorably to antidepressants. However, sometimes people need additional help. TMS can help those who are experiencing treatment-resistant depression. Also, medications can come with a range of side effects and other issues. Some of the most common side effects of antidepressants are weight gain, stomach upset, dry mouth, drowsiness, and sexual dysfunction. When receiving TMS, it’s important to also work with your mental healthcare professional on finding the right medications for you. For patients who don’t respond to medications or therapy as well as they’d hoped, TMS may be the right choice for them. If you or a loved one are struggling with depression episodes that aren’t going away, contact Pulse TMS. Our technicians are standing by to answer your questions, so you can see if you’re a candidate for TMS treatment.

- Follow the schedule through until the very end. - Stay in touch with your doctor and report any side effects. - Talk to a therapist. A therapist can help you cope with any side effects or returning symptoms of depression or anxiety while you are tapering the medication. TMS: TREAT YOUR DEPRESSION WITHOUT BRAIN ZAPS, WITHOUT MEDICATION
Many people give up on their depression treatment if they experience side effects or they feel as though their current treatment isn’t working. Giving up on treatment can leave you feeling discouraged and hopeless. It can be demoralizing when the symptoms return after stopping the medication. It can also be dangerous, in the case of discontinuation syndrome, to unilaterally decide to stop treatment. If you have experienced side effects like brain shakes or brain zaps after stopping antidepressants or the symptoms have returned, don’t give up on treatment. It is possible to treat your depressionwithout brain zaps, without medication. Many people do get their depression under control with the right treatment. A non-invasive, no medication alternative to antidepressants is transcranial magnetic stimulation. TMS is a non-invasive treatment for people dealing with depression. Numerousresearch studies have been conducted to proveits effectiveness, and it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2008 for severe depression. It is also a good alternative for people who have not found relief from antidepressants due to their preponderance of systemic effects. Transcranial magnetic stimulation uses magnets to stimulate a specific area of the brain that is related to depression. TMS promotes new brain cell activity in this area of the brain, which helps get the symptoms of depression under control. The few, mild side effects that can occur are scalp irritation at the treatment site and headache, both of which can be treated with over-the-counter pain relief. If you think that you have treatment-resistant depression, talk with your doctor about whether or not TMS would work for you. What is a Brain Zap? Also known as “brain shakes”, “brain shocks” or “brain flips, a brain zap is a phenomenon that occurs as a result of decreasing the dosage or ceasing antidepressants
What are the most common side effects of Antidepressants? The most common side effects of antidepressants are insomnia, blurred vision, dry mouth, fatigue, weight gain, nausea, GI distress and sexual dysfunction. What are the most common side effects of TMS? The most common side effects of TMS are scalp discomfort and headache. Can I stop taking antidepressants?

TMS stands for transcranial magnetic stimulation. It is used to treat depression by stimulating the brain non-invasively using an electromagnetic field, similar to those magnetic fields produced by an MRI machine. During TMS Therapy, a magnetic field is administered in very short pulses to the part of your brain that research has demonstrated to be associated with depression. The typical initial course of treatment is about 50 minutes daily over 4-6 weeks. The NeuroStar TMS Therapy system uses short pulses of magnetic fields to stimulate the area of the brain that is thought to function differently in patients with depression. The magnetic field produces an electric current in the brain that stimulates the brain cells (neurons). This results in changes in the brain that are thought to be beneficial in the treatment of depression. NeuroStar® is non-systemic (does not circulate in the blood throughout the body), so it does not have side effects such as weight gain, sexual dysfunction, nausea, dry mouth, sedation, among others that are commonly found with antidepressant drugs. The most common side effects reported with NeuroStar TMS during clinical trials were headache and scalp pain or discomfort – generally mild to moderate – occurring less frequently after the first week of treatment. NeuroStar TMS Therapy is cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with depression who have failed to achieve satisfactory improvement from prior antidepressant medication. * TMS Therapy may not work for all patients with depression. You should speak with your doctor to determine if TMS Therapy is an appropriate treatment option for you. No. TMS Therapy involves a unique method of using pulsed magnetic fields for therapeutic benefit. The intensity of the magnetic field is similar to that of the magnetic fields used in magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI. These techniques differ radically from the use of low intensity, static magnetic fields. These products deliver weak and undirected static fields that are not capable of activating brain cells. No, the two procedures are very different. While both are effective in the treatment of depression, there are many differences in safety and tolerability. During the TMS Therapy procedure, patients sit in a chair and are awake and alert throughout the entire 50-minute procedure – no sedation is used with TMS Therapy. Patients can transport themselves to and from treatment. In over 10,000 active treatments with NeuroStar TMS Therapy in clinical trials, no seizures were observed. TMS Therapy was also shown to have no negative effects on memory function in clinical studies. However, there is a remote risk of seizure with TMS Therapy. In contrast, “shock therapy,” or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), intentionally causes a seizure. Patients receiving ECT must be sedated with general anesthesia and paralyzed with muscle relaxants. Recovery from an ECT treatment session occurs slowly, and patients are usually closely monitored for minutes or a few hours after a treatment. Short-term confusion and memory loss are common with ECT, and long-term disruptions in memory have been shown to occur and may persist indefinitely in some people. Because of the side effects associated with ECT, a significant amount of caregiver support is required. Sarkis Family Psychiatry typically delivers NeuroStar TMS Therapy 5 times per week for 50 minute sessions over 5-6 weeks, but it varies. Your treatment may be shorter or longer.

TMS can improve depression symptoms in clients with treatment-resistant depression who have not responded to other depression treatments like antidepressant medications or talk therapy. It also has far fewer side effects than antidepressant medication, which can lead to weight gain and high blood pressure. TMS for Bipolar Disorder
TMS can be an effective treatment for symptoms of bipolar disorder as it can increase the excitability of brain activity in the target area of the brain, improving symptoms of depression. While studies have found that it may induce manic or hypomanic symptoms through stimulation, almost all bipolar disorder treatments carry this risk. TMS for Teens and Kids
Mood disorders like depression are widespread among children and teens across the world. Inadequate treatment can lead to conduct disorders, illness, poor performance at school, and a greater risk of suicide. The good news is that depression in teens is treatable and can open the doors to the future they dream of. TMS therapy can be an effective treatment for young people with depression, and the procedure's minimal side effects and accessibility make it an attractive option for young people who may want to fit TMS treatment alongside their work or studies. What Is Deep TMS Therapy? Deep TMS therapy is a form of TMS therapy that uses special combinations of coils. These coils produce electromagnetic pulses that reach below the surface of the skull, and different coils are used to reach each brain region. The FDA has approved deep TMS with the 'H1' coil for the treatment of people with treatment-resistant depression who have not responded to psychotherapy or medicine. How Much Does TMS Therapy Cost? TMS therapy can be one of the most cost-effective treatments for depression and other medical conditions. Many insurance providers cover TMS therapy under certain conditions. We accept a number of insurances as well as have payment options. To get more information contact us. We are available 24 hours a day. Is TMS Treatment the Same As Shock Therapy? Electroshock therapy (ECT) involves applying electrical currents directly to the client's head when they are sedated by anesthesia. While it can lead to short-term cognitive improvements, it is an invasive procedure that may require someone to take a break from work and home responsibilities. On the other hand, TMS therapy is non-invasive, passing electromagnetic currents through the skull. It is completely pain-free and has few side effects other than a temporary mild headache or skull discomfort. Who Should Avoid TMS Treatment? Clients who have permanent metal implants in their heads other than dental braces or fillings should not receive TMS therapy. The electromagnetic signals could cause these implants to heat up, move, or function incorrectly, risking injury or death. Implants that prevent a client from participating in TMS therapy include:
- Deep brain stimulators
- Aneurysm coils or clips
- Tattoos on the face with metallic or magnetic ink
- Electrodes that monitor brain activity
- Any other metal medical devices or objects in or near the head
Those considering TMS treatment should also speak with a doctor if they:
- Take any medication
- Have a history of seizures
- Have a family history of epilepsy
- Live with co-occurring mental disorders
- Have a brain injury
- Have had other medical conditions
- Have previously been treated with TMS
- Are pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant
What Are the Side-Effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation? Side effects of TMS treatment are usually mild to moderate and improve soon after each session. They also tend to decrease as clients participate in sessions throughout their treatment. Common side effects may include:
- Scalp discomfort
- Tingling, spasms, or twitching of facial muscles
- Lightheadedness or dizziness
Though these side effects are mild, doctors may be able to reduce them by adjusting the intensity of the magnetic fields. There is currently not enough evidence regarding the long-term side effects of TMS treatment. Mental Wellness Treatment and Neurodiversity - TMS Therapy Near Me
Neurodiversity refers to the difference between the parts of the brain that impact the way people socialize, learn, feel, and behave. Neurodiversity supports the view that when a brain functions differently, it is not a disability or an illness that needs to be treated. Instead, those struggling should think about adapting their social structures to accommodate their differences.

A Proven Non-drug Treatment
Magnetic energy similar to what is used in an (MRI) is used to stimulate the areas of the brain that are sluggish and causing depressed mood. Clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of NeuroStar® TMS Therapy in treating patients who have not benefited from prior antidepressant medication. NeuroStar TMS Therapy was studied in adult patients suffering from Major Depressive Disorder, all of whom had not received satisfactory improvement with previous treatments. TMS stands for transcranial magnetic stimulation. It is used to treat depression by stimulating the brain non-invasively using electromagnetic fields, similar to those produced by an MRI machine. During TMS Therapy, a magnetic field is administered in very short pulses to the part of the brain that research has demonstrated to be associated with depression. The typical initial course of treatment is about 19-37 minutes daily over 4-6 weeks. The NeuroStar TMS Therapy system uses short pulses of magnetic fields to stimulate the area of the brain that is thought to function abnormally in patients with depression. The magnetic field produces an electric current in the brain that stimulates the brain cells (neurons). This results in changes that are thought to be beneficial in the treatment of depression. It usually takes time for healthcare insurers to establish coverage policies for newly approved treatments such as NeuroStar TMS. However, many commercial and Medicare plans have recognized the effectiveness of treating depression with TMS Therapy and now cover TMS as part of their plans. See here for a full list of insurance plans that cover TMS. NeuroStar® is non-systemic (does not circulate in the blood throughout the body), so it does not have side effects such as weight gain, sexual dysfunction, nausea, dry mouth, sedation, etc. The most common side effects reported during clinical trials were headache and scalp discomfort – generally mild to moderate – occurring less frequently after the first week of treatment. No. TMS Therapy involves a unique method of using pulsed magnetic fields for therapeutic benefit. The intensity of the magnetic field is similar to that of the magnetic fields used in magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI. These techniques differ radically from the popular use of low intensity, static magnetic fields. These products deliver weak and undirected static fields that are not capable of activating brain cells.

While TMS Therapy has shown to be effective, not all patients will benefit from it. Patients should be carefully monitored for worsening symptoms, signs or symptoms of suicidal behavior, and/or unusual behavior. Families and caregivers should also be aware of the need to observe patients and notify their treatment provider if symptoms worsen. Typically, the average course of TMS Therapy happens five times per week for exactly 37 minutes sessions over a 4-6 week timeframe. Any additional treatments are based on clinical judgment. No. While both show effective results for treating depression, there are many differences in safety and tolerability. During a TMS treatment session, patients are sitting, awake and alert throughout the entire 37-minute procedure. This means that no sedation is required for TMS Therapy. Patients are able to transport themselves to and from their treatment. In contrast, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), commonly referred to as “shock therapy,” is meant to intentionally causes a seizure. Patients who receive ECT are sedated with general anesthesia and paralyzed with muscle relaxants. After the treatment, recovery occurs slowly, and patients are typically monitored under close supervision for minutes or a even few hours after a treatment. Patients often experience short-term confusion and memory loss after a ECT session. Even long-term memory disruptions have been reported and may persist indefinitely in some people. Significant caregiver supervision is often required after treatment, due to the side effects commonly associated with ECT. TMS is non-systemic, which means that it does not circulate in the blood throughout the body. Because it’s non-systemic, it does not have typical anti-depression medication side effects such as weight gain, sexual dysfunction, nausea, dry mouth, sedation, etc. The most common side effects reported during clinical trials were mild to moderate headache and scalp discomfort. Side effects typically occur less frequently after the first week of treatment. Yes! Transcranial magnetic stimulation is typically covered by most insurances. You can speak to one of our intake specialists to learn more about your specific plan. A TMS device sends short stimulating pulses of magnetic fields to the area of the brain that is thought to function abnormally in patients with depression. An electric current is produced by the magnetic field in the brain that stimulates the brain cells (neurons). The results show changes that may be beneficial in the treatment of depression. Initial treatment often lasts about 37 minutes, performed every day for about 4-6 weeks. TMS stands for transcranial magnetic stimulation. It is commonly used to treat forms of depression by stimulating the brain non-invasively using electromagnetic fields, similar to those produced by an MRI machine.

TMS Therapy safety and tolerability
NeuroStar Advanced Therapy (TMS) is safe and easy to tolerate. Because it is not a depression drug, NeuroStar TMS Therapy does not have the same side effects that are associated with traditional antidepressant medications. More than 1.6 million treatments have been performed with NeuroStar, further proving its safety and tolerability record.5,12
NeuroStar TMS Therapy Side Effects
In clinical trials, fewer than 5% of people discontinued treatment due to adverse events. The most common side effect was temporary pain or discomfort at or near the treatment site during therapy that usually resolves within the first week of treatment.1,2
People should notify their doctor if they experience worsening depression symptoms, signs, or symptoms of suicidal behavior and/or unusual behavior. Family members and support individuals should also be aware of the need to observe their loved ones and notify their treatment provider if symptoms worsen.5
NeuroStar Advanced Therapy (TMS) should not be used with people who have non-removable conductive metal or stimulator implants in or near the head or people who have active or inactive implants such as deep brain stimulators, cochlear implants, and vagus nerve stimulators.5

Commonly asked questions about Transcranila Magnetic Stimlation (TMS) answered by Dr. Daniel Press, Director, TMS Clinical Program at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center:
What is TMS? TMS stands for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. It uses magnetic fields to induce a current in specific brain areas and thus stimulate or suppress brain activity. Using TMS allows doctors to change brain activity without surgery and with minimal discomfort to the patient. TMS has been used to treat a variety of disorders including migraines, stroke, Parkinson's disease and depression. Who is a good candidate for TMS for depression? In 2009, the Food and Drug Administration approved the NeuroStar TMS Therapy system for treatment of people with major depressive disorder who haven't seen satisfactory improvement from medication. As with any treatment option, you and your doctor should discuss if TMS therapy is right for you. What are the sessions like and how many are needed? During each TMS session, patients sit comfortably in a chair. The stimulation coil (wand) is held just above the head, targeting magnetic pulses to a 2-3 centimeter area of a specific area of the brain. The nature of the magnetic fields allows them to pass through the patient's hair, skin and skull and into the mood-regulating area without being distorted in any way. Patients do not require anesthesia or sedation. In the brain, these magnetic pulses produce small electrical currents. The electricity created in the brain cannot be felt by the patient, but is sufficient to change the activity of brain cells. Applied repeatedly, these magnetic pulses modify the activity of the targeted brain area and can thus help the brain overcome the dysfunction associated with depression. Treatments last for about 40 minutes and occur every day for a period of several weeks. Is it safe? TMS is a safe treatment for depression if appropriate guidelines are followed. In more than 10,000 treatments administered in clinical studies, the most common side effect was mild-to-moderate scalp pain or discomfort at the treatment area, which declined ""markedly after the first week."" Fewer than 5 percent of patients stopped treatment due to adverse effects. There is a very small risk of seizure - about the same risk as when taking medications to treat depression. Does it work? In clinical studies involving hundreds of people with major depressive disorder, significant improvement was recorded for symptoms of core depression, anxiety, and other forms of psychological distress. In most patients, benefits lasted through the 6-month study follow-up period. While NeuroStar TMS Therapy has been proven effective, not all patients will benefit. Patients should be carefully monitored for worsening symptoms. Will my insurance cover it? While the treatment was recently FDA approved, not all insurance companies yet cover the treatments. Our staff will assist you in contacting your insurance company about coverage. Where do I call for more information? Call the TMS Clinical Program at the Berenson-Allen Center for Noninvasive Brain Stimulation, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center at 617-667-0303.

Occasional feelings of anxiety and depression are expected and considered normal for the average person. However, when these feelings pervade one’s thoughts and it becomes impossible to function normally, further evaluation and consideration is necessary. Anxiety and depression are both common in our society, though it is reported that only a third of sufferers receive treatment for their condition. There are numerous disorders under the large umbrella of anxiety and depression, and it believed that the cause of symptoms are multi factorial and include biological, genetic, environmental and psychological factors. While most seek treatment with cognitive therapy and oral medications, some people are refractory to these treatments and require help with other modalities. Since the 1940s and 1950s, Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) has been used for the treatment of depression and mania. ECT works by administering general anesthesia to the patient and using an electric current that causes a brief seizure. While ECT can help with severe depression and suicidal thoughts, potential side effects include adverse reaction to the anesthesia, memory loss and confusion. Since 2008, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been used approved by the FDA for treatment of depression. During a TMS procedure, a magnetic field generator is placed against the scalp of a patient. Electric currents stimulate nerve cells involved in mood control and depression. Unlike ECT, patients are awake and alert during procedures and can be completed in an office setting. With TMS, the risk of general anesthesia is alleviated. In addition, the main reported side effect is headache, as compared to the side effects of anesthesia and possible amnesia. Here, at the Center for Natural and Integrative Medicine, we have practitioners certified in the administration of TMS. If you are experiencing ongoing symptoms of depression and have failed other therapeutic options, TMS may be a choice for you. It may be an important step in your path to healing.","[{'passage': 'Side effects and medication option for TMS\nDepression is one of the leading causes of disability in the US among the people between 15-44 years of age.

When receiving TMS, it’s important to also work with your mental healthcare professional on finding the right medications for you. For patients who don’t respond to medications or therapy as well as they’d hoped, TMS may be the right choice for them. If you or a loved one are struggling with depression episodes that aren’t going away, contact Pulse TMS. Our technicians are standing by to answer your questions, so you can see if you’re a candidate for TMS treatment.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:af756cdf-f68d-401b-a0d8-f6ddc056058b>']}, {'passage': '- Follow the schedule through until the very end. - Stay in touch with your doctor and report any side effects. - Talk to a therapist.

TMS: TREAT YOUR DEPRESSION WITHOUT BRAIN ZAPS, WITHOUT MEDICATION\nMany people give up on their depression treatment if they experience side effects or they feel as though their current treatment isn’t working. Giving up on treatment can leave you feeling discouraged and hopeless. It can be demoralizing when the symptoms return after stopping the medication. It can also be dangerous, in the case of discontinuation syndrome, to unilaterally decide to stop treatment. If you have experienced side effects like brain shakes or brain zaps after stopping antidepressants or the symptoms have returned, don’t give up on treatment. It is possible to treat your depressionwithout brain zaps, without medication. Many people do get their depression under control with the right treatment. A non-invasive, no medication alternative to antidepressants is transcranial magnetic stimulation. TMS is a non-invasive treatment for people dealing with depression. Numerousresearch studies have been conducted to proveits effectiveness, and it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2008 for severe depression. It is also a good alternative for people who have not found relief from antidepressants due to their preponderance of systemic effects. Transcranial magnetic stimulation uses magnets to stimulate a specific area of the brain that is related to depression. TMS promotes new brain cell activity in this area of the brain, which helps get the symptoms of depression under control. The few, mild side effects that can occur are scalp irritation at the treatment site and headache, both of which can be treated with over-the-counter pain relief. If you think that you have treatment-resistant depression, talk with your doctor about whether or not TMS would work for you. What is a Brain Zap? Also known as “brain shakes”, “brain shocks” or “brain flips, a brain zap is a phenomenon that occurs as a result of decreasing the dosage or ceasing antidepressants\nWhat are the most common side effects of Antidepressants? The most common side effects of antidepressants are insomnia, blurred vision, dry mouth, fatigue, weight gain, nausea, GI distress and sexual dysfunction. What are the most common side effects of TMS? The most common side effects of TMS are scalp discomfort and headache. Can I stop taking antidepressants? If you would like to stop or reduce the dosage of antidepressants you are taking, consult with your doctor. Your doctor will be able to help and guide you with a tapering schedule and discuss your ongoing treatment.

TMS stands for transcranial magnetic stimulation. It is used to treat depression by stimulating the brain non-invasively using an electromagnetic field, similar to those magnetic fields produced by an MRI machine. During TMS Therapy, a magnetic field is administered in very short pulses to the part of your brain that research has demonstrated to be associated with depression. The typical initial course of treatment is about 50 minutes daily over 4-6 weeks. The NeuroStar TMS Therapy system uses short pulses of magnetic fields to stimulate the area of the brain that is thought to function differently in patients with depression. The magnetic field produces an electric current in the brain that stimulates the brain cells (neurons). This results in changes in the brain that are thought to be beneficial in the treatment of depression. NeuroStar® is non-systemic (does not circulate in the blood throughout the body), so it does not have side effects such as weight gain, sexual dysfunction, nausea, dry mouth, sedation, among others that are commonly found with antidepressant drugs. The most common side effects reported with NeuroStar TMS during clinical trials were headache and scalp pain or discomfort – generally mild to moderate – occurring less frequently after the first week of treatment. NeuroStar TMS Therapy is cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with depression who have failed to achieve satisfactory improvement from prior antidepressant medication. * TMS Therapy may not work for all patients with depression. You should speak with your doctor to determine if TMS Therapy is an appropriate treatment option for you. No. TMS Therapy involves a unique method of using pulsed magnetic fields for therapeutic benefit. The intensity of the magnetic field is similar to that of the magnetic fields used in magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI. These techniques differ radically from the use of low intensity, static magnetic fields. These products deliver weak and undirected static fields that are not capable of activating brain cells. No, the two procedures are very different. While both are effective in the treatment of depression, there are many differences in safety and tolerability. During the TMS Therapy procedure, patients sit in a chair and are awake and alert throughout the entire 50-minute procedure – no sedation is used with TMS Therapy. Patients can transport themselves to and from treatment. In over 10,000 active treatments with NeuroStar TMS Therapy in clinical trials, no seizures were observed. TMS Therapy was also shown to have no negative effects on memory function in clinical studies. However, there is a remote risk of seizure with TMS Therapy. In contrast, “shock therapy,” or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), intentionally causes a seizure. Patients receiving ECT must be sedated with general anesthesia and paralyzed with muscle relaxants. Recovery from an ECT treatment session occurs slowly, and patients are usually closely monitored for minutes or a few hours after a treatment. Short-term confusion and memory loss are common with ECT, and long-term disruptions in memory have been shown to occur and may persist indefinitely in some people. Because of the side effects associated with ECT, a significant amount of caregiver support is required. Sarkis Family Psychiatry typically delivers NeuroStar TMS Therapy 5 times per week for 50 minute sessions over 5-6 weeks, but it varies.

Electroshock therapy (ECT) involves applying electrical currents directly to the client's head when they are sedated by anesthesia. While it can lead to short-term cognitive improvements, it is an invasive procedure that may require someone to take a break from work and home responsibilities. On the other hand, TMS therapy is non-invasive, passing electromagnetic currents through the skull. It is completely pain-free and has few side effects other than a temporary mild headache or skull discomfort. Who Should Avoid TMS Treatment? Clients who have permanent metal implants in their heads other than dental braces or fillings should not receive TMS therapy. The electromagnetic signals could cause these implants to heat up, move, or function incorrectly, risking injury or death. Implants that prevent a client from participating in TMS therapy include:\n- Deep brain stimulators\n- Aneurysm coils or clips\n- Tattoos on the face with metallic or magnetic ink\n- Electrodes that monitor brain activity\n- Any other metal medical devices or objects in or near the head\nThose considering TMS treatment should also speak with a doctor if they:\n- Take any medication\n- Have a history of seizures\n- Have a family history of epilepsy\n- Live with co-occurring mental disorders\n- Have a brain injury\n- Have had other medical conditions\n- Have previously been treated with TMS\n- Are pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant\nWhat Are the Side-Effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation? Side effects of TMS treatment are usually mild to moderate and improve soon after each session. They also tend to decrease as clients participate in sessions throughout their treatment. Common side effects may include:\n- Scalp discomfort\n- Tingling, spasms, or twitching of facial muscles\n- Lightheadedness or dizziness\nThough these side effects are mild, doctors may be able to reduce them by adjusting the intensity of the magnetic fields. There is currently not enough evidence regarding the long-term side effects of TMS treatment. Mental Wellness Treatment and Neurodiversity - TMS Therapy Near Me\nNeurodiversity refers to the difference between the parts of the brain that impact the way people socialize, learn, feel, and behave.

TMS stands for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. It uses magnetic fields to induce a current in specific brain areas and thus stimulate or suppress brain activity. Using TMS allows doctors to change brain activity without surgery and with minimal discomfort to the patient. TMS has been used to treat a variety of disorders including migraines, stroke, Parkinson\'s disease and depression. Who is a good candidate for TMS for depression? In 2009, the Food and Drug Administration approved the NeuroStar TMS Therapy system for treatment of people with major depressive disorder who haven\'t seen satisfactory improvement from medication. As with any treatment option, you and your doctor should discuss if TMS therapy is right for you. What are the sessions like and how many are needed? During each TMS session, patients sit comfortably in a chair. The stimulation coil (wand) is held just above the head, targeting magnetic pulses to a 2-3 centimeter area of a specific area of the brain. The nature of the magnetic fields allows them to pass through the patient\'s hair, skin and skull and into the mood-regulating area without being distorted in any way. Patients do not require anesthesia or sedation. In the brain, these magnetic pulses produce small electrical currents. The electricity created in the brain cannot be felt by the patient, but is sufficient to change the activity of brain cells. Applied repeatedly, these magnetic pulses modify the activity of the targeted brain area and can thus help the brain overcome the dysfunction associated with depression. Treatments last for about 40 minutes and occur every day for a period of several weeks. Is it safe? TMS is a safe treatment for depression if appropriate guidelines are followed. In more than 10,000 treatments administered in clinical studies, the most common side effect was mild-to-moderate scalp pain or discomfort at the treatment area, which declined ""markedly after the first week."" Fewer than 5 percent of patients stopped treatment due to adverse effects. There is a very small risk of seizure - about the same risk as when taking medications to treat depression. Does it work? In clinical studies involving hundreds of people with major depressive disorder, significant improvement was recorded for symptoms of core depression, anxiety, and other forms of psychological distress. In most patients, benefits lasted through the 6-month study follow-up period. While NeuroStar TMS Therapy has been proven effective, not all patients will benefit. Patients should be carefully monitored for worsening symptoms. Will my insurance cover it? While the treatment was recently FDA approved, not all insurance companies yet cover the treatments.

However, when these feelings pervade one’s thoughts and it becomes impossible to function normally, further evaluation and consideration is necessary. Anxiety and depression are both common in our society, though it is reported that only a third of sufferers receive treatment for their condition. There are numerous disorders under the large umbrella of anxiety and depression, and it believed that the cause of symptoms are multi factorial and include biological, genetic, environmental and psychological factors. While most seek treatment with cognitive therapy and oral medications, some people are refractory to these treatments and require help with other modalities. Since the 1940s and 1950s, Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) has been used for the treatment of depression and mania. ECT works by administering general anesthesia to the patient and using an electric current that causes a brief seizure. While ECT can help with severe depression and suicidal thoughts, potential side effects include adverse reaction to the anesthesia, memory loss and confusion. Since 2008, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been used approved by the FDA for treatment of depression. During a TMS procedure, a magnetic field generator is placed against the scalp of a patient. Electric currents stimulate nerve cells involved in mood control and depression.

Mental health conditions and depression are confusing and overwhelming, but the good news is that the relief is now possible as there are more advanced treatment options available than ever before to help you live a healthy life. Depression generally leads to isolation from the friends and family, and an only medical professional can provide the necessary help. Most often, medication and talk therapy help decrease depression, but those with major depressive disorder or treatment-resistant depression need to try multiple medications or advanced therapies like TMS. TMS is a non-invasive and drug-free therapy prescribed for patients who suffer from MDD and don\u2019t respond well to medication. TMS delivers electromagnetic pulses to the pre-frontal cortex that regulates mood and stimulate cortical neurons to relieve the depression symptoms. Approximately 50-60% of people suffering from depression who have tried and failed to benefit from medications, witness full remission with TMS. In 2008, FDA cleared TMS for treating depression, and it is administered in sessions that generally last for 30-40 minutes, five times a week over 4-6 weeks. No sedation or anesthesia is given to the patients; therefore, they can resume their usual activities right after their session. Repeated treatment encourages the formation of new circuits providing relief to the patients. Unlike depression medications, TMS is not associated with systemic side effects that are caused by the passage of drugs through the bloodstream. Only reported side effect of TMS is mild-to-moderate discomfort caused by the electromagnetic pulses. Some of the common side effects include:\n2. Spasms, tingling, and twitching of the facial muscles\n3. Discomfort in the scalp at the site of stimulation\nYou can ask the doctor to adjust the stimulation level to reduce the symptoms if you experience painful scalp sensation or facial twitching. Or can take over-the-counter pain medication and tend to lessen over the course of treatmen1t. There is minimal risk of seizure. To ensure that you are eligible for TMS a physical examination and psychiatric evolution to discuss depression is done. The evaluation helps you make sure that TMS is safe and a good option. TMS is not safe in the following conditions:\nYou are pregnant or planning to get pregnant\nThere is an implanted medical device in the body\nYou have a history of seizures\nThere is brain damage from past injury or illness\nYou suffer from frequent headaches\nTo ensure you get the best treatment, it is suggested to look for a well-reputed clinic. Getting the treatment from experienced practitioners and healthcare providers will ensure exceptional comfort and minimum side effects. Before you start the therapy, make an appointment and see if you are comfortable with them, and you feel calm at the clinic. Also, check whether the clinic accepts health insurance as most health insurance companies these days cover TMS treatment."",

Common side effects may include:\n- Scalp discomfort\n- Tingling, spasms, or twitching of facial muscles\n- Lightheadedness or dizziness\nThough these side effects are mild, doctors may be able to reduce them by adjusting the intensity of the magnetic fields. There is currently not enough evidence regarding the long-term side effects of TMS treatment. Mental Wellness Treatment and Neurodiversity - TMS Therapy Near Me\nNeurodiversity refers to the difference between the parts of the brain that impact the way people socialize, learn, feel, and behave. Neurodiversity supports the view that when a brain functions differently, it is not a disability or an illness that needs to be treated. Instead, those struggling should think about adapting their social structures to accommodate their differences."",

Scalp discomfort during the procedure is the most common side effect. TMS should not be used for patients with implanted metallic devices that include metal plates in the skull or aneurysm coils, clips or stents. Special precautions are recommended for individuals with implants such as pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators. Is TMS covered by insurance?

TMS uses non-invasive electromagnetic energy to stimulate the brain. Research on TMS and depression have found that the electromagnetic pulses, when applied to depressed areas of the brain, activates neurons thought to be responsible for depression symptoms. Why would someone choose TMS Along with medication? Medications are often the first line of defense in treating depression. Most patients will respond favorably to antidepressants. However, sometimes people need additional help. TMS can help those who are experiencing treatment-resistant depression. Also, medications can come with a range of side effects and other issues. Some of the most common side effects of antidepressants are weight gain, stomach upset, dry mouth, drowsiness, and sexual dysfunction. When receiving TMS, it\u2019s important to also work with your mental healthcare professional on finding the right medications for you. For patients who don\u2019t respond to medications or therapy as well as they\u2019d hoped, TMS may be the right choice for them.

32,<urn:uuid:4ddac3b6-2787-446a-8aa9-8d06dbf27d46>,"North Carolinian hip-hop icon J. Cole ruffled a few purple hairs with the finale track of his newly released KOD album, 1985 (Intro to ‘The Fall Off’). Some clumsily labeled the record a “diss” track at the millennial rap generation, namely Lil Pump: the 17-year-old Miami rapper who dropped an unprovoked “F**k J. Cole” diss song. But it’s actually a page from Cole’s 33-year-old book of wisdom that he was generous enough to share with the emerging rap generation beneath him without needing to resort to a “diss” record. However, according to Coke Boys founder French Montana, “every generation of hip-hop” is to be respected. The South Bronx native spoke with LA Weekly after a question about hip-hop enthusiasts who “hate” on Lil Pump. French said that he loves what the rapper is doing for the rap game, though it isn’t clear what that specifically is. “I love what Tupac and Biggie did for the game, I also love what Run-DMC and them did for the game,” he continued. “I just feel like the game just changes.” The “Unforgettable” rapper championed the financially elevated lifestyle rap has afforded artists in this day and age as it “just shows growth.” Without name-dropping anyone, French believes that anyone who doesn’t like Pump shouldn’t listen to him, anyway, especially since there are still lyrical artists existing in the current state of rap. “Whatever kind of rap you want to listen to, go listen to it,” he said. “I love Lil Pump’s music.” As aforementioned, French doesn't specifically name anyone, but also doesn’t speak much to Pump’s shots at Cole which—if anyone could take a wild guess—might presumably stem from not appreciating or liking the Dreamville leader as a “lyrical” artist. He’ll be happy to know he has at least one friend and fan in French. See the purple-haired rapper’s new attempt at Cole’s attention in the video below.

He stated that the game just changes, and pointed to the financially elevated lifestyle that rap has afforded artists today as a sign of growth.","French Montana, in an interview, discussed the evolution of hip-hop and its different generations by highlighting how the genre has transformed over time and how it continues to influence new artists. He noted that hip-hop has gone through various phases, from its early days in the Bronx to the rise of gangsta rap in the '90s and the more melodic and mainstream sounds in recent years.

French Montana mentioned that the evolution of hip-hop has allowed for a more diverse range of styles and influences, which has contributed to its lasting appeal and ability to reach broader audiences. He also acknowledged the importance of understanding hip-hop's roots and history, while embracing the changes and innovations that come with each new generation of artists.

Overall, French Montana sees hip-hop as a dynamic and ever-evolving art form that continues to inspire and connect people across different cultures and backgrounds.","You are a helpful assistant.

### Context: Everyone I had worked with on my early projects is gone -- they’ve all been fired and there are new guys coming in that think they can teach old dogs new tricks. They bring these people in and give them job functions that had been covered by multiple people in the past. It makes it hard to know what to expect from the records. What sort of impact do you think this has had on music itself? There’s no lack of interesting and good music coming out, it’s just the way the system works now. I’d like to have the comfort of thinking that everything that has happened to me hasn’t been luck; it’s been me making good decisions. When I don’t understand what’s going on, I just try to sit and watch. It’s about trying to fit into the scheme of where things are going in the future. I’m an artist that wrote about the harsh realities and that’s always what’s translated the strongest about my music. In film thusfar, I’ve only taken on characters that embodied the same mannerisms or attitudes. I’m trying to broaden peoples' perception of me, so that when they see me they don’t pigeonhole me as being only able to do one thing. Does the evolving industry make it more difficult for you to make music or does it have no impact whatsoever? It’s hard if you’re not in a position where the machine is behind you non-stop. I’m lucky to be an artist that doesn’t have to look for press. If I say anything controversial in this interview, they’ll take this and run it on all the blogs. What do you think about the evolution of hip-hop from gangsta archetypes to skinny jean-wearing hyper-emotional types? It’s missing what I fell in love with about hip-hop culture. There’s almost no one creating or making the type of hip-hop that I grew up on. I’m a huge Ice Cube fan — I still watch Cube like I’ve never sold a record. I still watch his interviews and study him. He came from the position where his music reflected the aggressions and harsh realities of life, and now he’s highly respected on a broader scope. You can see a television show based on a movie he made. It’s interesting to watch someone's personal choices and how they impact their career. Dre is different from me — his relationship with Jimmy Iovine will allow him to stay relevant regardless of what he does. He can stay home for another 10 years and then put out a record and it will get tons of promotion... He’ll always be a priority. Whatever happened with the Rick Ross feud? Did you ever talk to him and clear the air? I never had a conversation with him. My focus shifted during that record. A lot of times, earlier in my career, I was competing with artists because that was what I loved about hip-hop: The idea that battling someone was necessary to defend your spot and you had to take on all challengers — so I did that constantly. No one thinks that way now and everyone looks at me like I’m the Broad Street Bully. The younger kids coming up missed that time frame, and even the conscious rap is gone, too. The stuff that Common Sense and Talib Kweli and Mos Def were rhyming about. What was socially conscious and responsible about the music has been replaced by hipster kids in skinny jeans and mohawks. Of course, that’s always been around, but it was usually confined to the Village. Artists have always had the opportunity to influence the culture, but now it’s the other way around: They’re trying to look like their audience to attract their audience. Now you can’t tell the difference between a Led Zeppelin fan and a hip-hop fan. Do you think this is just part of a natural ebb and flow of cultural change? It’s a cyclical shift. It’s like fashion, everything is recycled and comes back. I’m really excited by it. Sometimes, it’s best to just take a look at what’s going on and observe. On my first album, I was writing to one concept. With “Black Magic,” I wrote a bunch of material, but now I have time to spend on what I have to offer. I think it should be my best work.

Something like ""Cruise"" really does show how similar music from different parts of the country really can be. I think the way that kids grow up now, that with social media they get it all at once. Like, the coolest table in the cafeteria is probably the most mixed table of all. It's got the coolest black kids, it's got the coolest white kids, it's got the coolest Asian kids, it's got the coolest girls, the coolest guys, the jocks, the coolest nerd, you see what I'm saying? It's the mixture. Even with Florida Georgia Line, they're some pretty young guys they're like 27, you look at Nelly, this is my 16th year so those guys [knew me] since they were freakin' 11, I hate to say that shit [Laughs.] They've been influenced by myself and things of that nature, so when they come to the music they have no choice but to put some of the influence of what they've been listening to. Well this year marks the 15th anniversary of Country Grammar. What did you do differently on that record, compared to how you make records now? Man, it's a great saying, ""You have a lifetime to make your first record, you got a year to make every one after that."" That's basically it. When you're talking about Country Grammar, man, we were waiting since I started rapping to make that album. How was it different technically? It's a difference in the sound. I was kinda the only one doing what I was doing, now the whole fucking game is singing. [Laughs.] The whole game is melodic now, and I was the only one doing it. You know? I was the first one to sing his own hook, rap his own verses and sing his own bridge. And continuously doing that because my influences, such as Bone Thugs, Goodie Mob, Cee-Lo Green and Arrested Development, you're listening to 'em and trying to find your own niche and then when you come with it but you come with it in a way that's so surprising to people. People don't understand that, shit, the whole game is doing Nelly. Do you get rappers saying, ""Thanks for hooking this up. Thanks for making this happen?"" Nah man, it's all good. Obviously, when you meet other artists, other artists definitely show their appreciation. . . . It's kind of hard to find someone that sings and raps that wasn't a Nelly fan. And it's a little easier to do it now because of Auto-Tune. I didn't have Auto-Tune. That was straight my notes. I had to work that shit out. I had to actually hit notes. Are you anti-Auto-Tune? No, no, no. I'm not anti-anything. It's just used so much now, it just sounds like the norm. That's why I say I'm not ""anti."" One thing I know and I understand is evolution. Everything must change. . . . Hip-hop was created by the youth for the youth. So, you got to let the youth take it where they're gonna take it. If you want to be involved, be involved. If you don't, you don't. It's getting to a point now where hip-hop has a history. Older people, when I was younger, they didn't have hip-hop. If they didn't like it, they just listened to whatever they wanted to do. Now I'm a parent. I had hip-hop, so I don't have to listen to their hip hop. I can listen to my hip-hop. But we're still listening to hip-hop. Listen, I could be 65 years old, if Jay-Z's having a concert, I'm there. We're in a different era now. I'm not gonna never stop wearing Jordans. I mean unless another company gives me a hellafied check to stop wearing 'em. I don't care if I'm 80, I'mma put on some sneakers. And it's just one of those things that back in the day, it was a certain way you had to dress if you were older. ""Why do you have that baseball cap on? C'mon, you're a 50 year-old man. Why do you have on a ball cap and sneakers?"" Now, shit, it doesn't matter.

“What we’re gonna do right here is go back, way back, back into time.”
— Troglodite, by the Jimmy Castor Bunch
Hip-Hop has always been hyper-conscious about its roots, maybe because it began with young people playing, and then rapping over, older music. Hip-hop artists of all stripes are constantly sampling, referencing, and quoting artists from the past, creatively reconstructing their family trees. Every once in a while, an emcee takes this to the next level. They become lyrical historians, narrating the evolution of hip-hop and its art forms. I’ve always been a sucker for this genre of song, ever since I was a kid in the Boston suburbs scanning the radio dial intently to learn everything I could about this incredible sound coming from the nation’s urban centers. In this post, I share twelve songs about hip-hop history, some famous and some lesser known. Unless you’re extremely well-informed, it’ll probably take some additional research to get all the references (Rap Genius can help, http://rap.genius.com/). For teachers, these songs could come in handy as prompts for classroom discussions. For example, conversations about what these songs include, and what they leave out, could be extremely informative. These songs don’t really tell the whole story. They are pretty US-heavy and overly-nostalgic, and there are plenty of gaps. For one, I couldn’t find any written by women (if you know any, please comment!). Still, if you’re looking to dive into hip-hop’s roots, here are some guides to lead you. 1. South Bronx, by Boogie Down Productions
It’s generally agreed that hip-hop as we know it today first emerged in the South Bronx, so there’s no better song to start with than South Bronx, by KRS-One and Scott LaRock. This song was written in response to MC Shan and DJ Marley Marl’s, The Bridge, which claimed Queens, NY, as hip-hop’s birthplace. It’s clear today who won this argument. 2. Knowledge is Power, by Akala
Of course, hip-hop didn’t appear in the South Bronx out of nowhere. It’s roots lie deep in African, African-American, Afro-Caribbean, and Latin American musical and oral traditions. In Knowledge is Power, UK-based emcee Akala calls the Bronx-based origin story a “myth,” and argues that those who love hip-hop need to look much deeper into its antecedents. 3. Lune Tns, by Company Flow
Today the emcee has become the preeminent image of the hip-hop artist. But, of course, rapping is only one of the hip-hop elements. In Lune Tns, Bigg Jus of Company Flow pays homage to the great and lesser known graffiti artists of New York City. 4. Gangsta Rap, by Ice T
Hip-hop may have originally coalesced in New York, but it quickly spread. In Gangsta Rap, Ice T recounts how hip-hop was picked up by artists on the West Coast. There, hip-hop and local gang culture converged to birth West coast gangsta rap, which then took the world by storm (for good and ill). 5. Latinos Stand Up (Remix), by Chino XL, Sick Jacken, Thirstin Howl, B Real, Sinful, and Kid Frost
Latinos artists have been part of hip-hop’s evolution since its birth, but have often been unrecognized for their contributions. In this song, some of the most well-known Latino rappers join together to represent for the Latin hip-hop tradition. 6. Underground Heaven, by Cesar Comanche
Underground Heaven highlights the central role of the DJ/Producer in creating the sound we recognize today as hip-hop music. It’s something of an ode to the independent record store and the sample, and has a great verse that rolls through some of the most classic samples in hip-hop. 7. I Used To Love H.E.R., by Common
In this famous song, Common narrates the evolution of hip-hop metaphorically, personifying hip-hop as a woman with whom he has a sort of on-again, off-again relationship.

and MTV's Sway Calloway provides: ""The detail that manufactured that period so wonderful is that absolutely nothing was contrived. Every thing was even now becoming discovered and anything was however revolutionary and new"". [one zero five] Author William Jelani Cobb suggests ""what produced the era they inaugurated deserving of your expression golden was the sheer quantity of stylistic improvements that arrived into existence. The 2008 Broadway production fused salsa and hip hop types, and involved rap. Miranda introduced hip hop to Richard Rogers Theater a second time in 2015 with his creation Hamilton. The demonstrate had box Business success. Hamilton and Within the Heights bundled rap as well as the cast recording of Hamilton created a number 1 album on the Billboard rap charts. The success of Hamilton reveals that hip hop might have a vital job in musical theater. [a hundred and seventy] Innovation and revitalization
In late 1979, Debbie Harry of Blondie took Nile Rodgers of Stylish to these types of an occasion, as the most crucial backing monitor made use of was the split from Stylish's ""Very good Situations"". The new model motivated Harry, and Blondie's afterwards hit one from 1981 ""Rapture"" became the 1st key single containing hip hop factors by a white team or artist to strike primary over the U. ..they have accomplished movies about nurse killers and Trainer killers and pupil killers. [Actor] Arnold Schwarzenegger blew away dozens of cops because the Terminator. But I do not hear anybody complaining about that."" In exactly the same interview, Ice-T instructed to Philips which the misunderstanding of Cop Killer plus the tries to censor it experienced racial overtones: ""The Supreme Court suggests It really is OK to get a white male to melt away a cross in community. But nobody would like a black man to write a file about a cop killer."" Occasional data—such as Grandmaster Flash's ""The Message"" in 1982 and Operate-DMC's ""It is Like That"" in 1984—received vital approval, but rap, typically, was dismissed being a passing fancy—far too repetitious, way too 1 dimensional. Still rap did not disappear, and an explosion of Strength and creativeness within the late eighties leaves rap these days as arguably the most very important new street-oriented audio in pop since the start of rock inside the fifties.

Hip hop as both a musical genre along with a tradition was shaped in the course of the seventies when block functions grew to become ever more preferred in Ny city, significantly among African-American youth residing in the Bronx. Nevertheless hip-hop music did not get officially recorded for the radio or television to play till 1979, largely on account of poverty for the duration of hip-hop's start and not enough acceptance outside ghetto neighborhoods. At block events DJs played percussive breaks of well-liked tunes utilizing two turntables as well as a DJ mixer to be able to Enjoy breaks from two copies of a similar history, alternating from one to another and lengthening the ""split"". [sixteen] Hip hop's early evolution happened as sampling technologies and drum devices turned extensively offered and affordable. Turntablist strategies for example scratching and beatmatching formulated combined Ateo Feo with the breaks and Jamaican toasting, a chanting vocal type, was applied over the beats. In Tanzania inside the early 2000s, community hip hop artists became well-known by infusing regional models of Afrobeat and arabesque melodies, dancehall and hip-hop beats with Swahili lyrics. Rap linguistics
Hip hop as music and tradition fashioned in the course of the 1970s in Ny city in the multicultural Trade in between African-American youth from America and young immigrants and youngsters of immigrants from nations during the Caribbean. Hip hop music in its infancy is called an outlet plus a voice for the disenfranchised youth of marginalized backgrounds and lower-income regions, as the hip hop lifestyle mirrored the social, economic and political realities in their lives.

[Criminologists Kevin] Steinmetz and [Howard] Henderson concluded that the main law enforcement-related themes in hip-hop are not pleasure and pride in aggressive and criminal acts, but the unfairness of the criminal justice system and the powerlessness felt by those targeted by it. Lyrics about law enforcement, for example, frequently portrayed cops as predators exercising an illegitimate power. Imprisonment, likewise, was blamed for weakening familial and community relationships and described a modern method of oppression. The study’s authors concluded that “the overwhelming message in hip-hop wasn’t that the rappers disliked the idea of justice, but they disliked the way it was being implemented.” More insights from the authors via Meredith Mohr:
“[T]he music is maturing, evolving,” Henderson said. “Take Jay-Z for example. If you look at his lyrical content from 1990-2012, you see the evolution from talking about drug selling at the beginning of his career to now talking about meeting with the president, helping with the campaign. It’s a very different conversation. We never saw an artist go backwards. You only saw them mature as they age, and experience and their music changes with them.”
Part of this, Henderson said, is because the audience has also changed with the artists. “Jay-Z’s listenership has aged with him,” Henderson said. “Part of it is that artists recognize that if they go back and talk about that very animalistic behavior, their listeners are going to say, ‘hey listen, this is not what I want to hear,’ and they’re going to go somewhere else.

spawned a new breed of rapper, styled as gun-toting hoodlum supposedly giving suburban America a frightening peek into ghetto life the group knew from pretty early on that about 80 percent of the people buying their albums were white, middle-class kids. Although the industry was happy to cash in, pressure by conservative advocacy groups on major corporations such as Time Warner (parent company of TIME.com) resulted in the industry backing away from promoting gangsta rap. ""Hip-Hop Nation"" includes original correspondence detailing efforts by Ice-T to be released from his Warner Brothers contract after the corporation had sought to curb certain lyrics. Gangsta rap, with its narrative tales and its cinematic funk-driven sound, offered a distinct alternative to the tricky bebop gymnastics of the freestyling East Coast. But hip-hop came close to destroying itself in the mid-'90s when that bicoastal rivalry almost turned into a shooting war, as Tupac Shakur between surviving shootings and spells in prison threatened the life of Brooklyn rapper the Notorious B.I.G. and both men, former friends, were by the end of 1997 dead in as-yet-unsolved drive-by shootings. But while most hip-hop fans today may be well versed in the tale of Tupac and Biggie, the show transports them back to an era they may find hard to imagine. After all, the almost pharaonic fantasy world of a Puffy Combs video is light-years away from the hand-stenciled mimeographs with crude sketches advertising an around-the-way appearance of Kurtis Blow or a block party featuring Grandmaster Flash. This was a do-it yourself movement in the outer boroughs, a culture being built by hand, brick by brick one to which the suits running the music industry in the glass towers across the river were mostly impervious for more than a decade. And for kids grown accustomed to hip-hop as the bearer of grim tales of death and destruction, ""Hip-Hop Nation"" offers a glimpse of a reminder that the cultural roots were in joyous block parties and people having getting together to have a good time no matter how grim their circumstances. That much is summed up in the words of one pioneering DJ carried in a video installation: ""If there was negativity and fights breaking out at your party, that means your DJ was whack."" IT WAS AT THOSE PARTIES in the ""Boogie Down"" South Bronx where hip-hop's founding fathers Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaata and Grandmaster Flash first began delivering spoken rhymes over the break beats on funk and disco records sometime in the mid-'70s. Today the signature beats-and-rhymes combination of the musical art form they created is as ubiquitous in America's tony suburbs as in its forgotten housing projects, and has kids in distant parts of the world whose first language may be French or Japanese or Wolof chanting choruses inviting their friends to ""get at me, dawg."" Hip-hop's language not simply its slang, which is as likely to be heard in Yale dorm rooms as on inner-city street corners, but its idiom, which involves combining the spoken (or screamed) word with a pastiche of musical elements drawn from previous songs and styles reassembled in new and unique combinations is not only the preeminent musical genre of a generation, it's also a complex, ever-evolving organism that has spawned countless dialects that are constantly in conversation with one another. HIP-HOP CULTURE may be difficult to define, but it is pervasive nonetheless. It began simply as a combination of four art forms deejaying, rapping, break dancing and graffiti tagging but it quickly evolved into a cultural revolution in which young African-Americans literally remade their America. In the spirit of Malcolm X and the Black Panthers, they didn't simply demand to be admitted as an equal in Whitey's world; they created their own popular culture grounded in the lived reality and aspirations of black life in America. Far from demanding to join the club, the hip-hop kids created their own. And once they'd built it, Whitey came, desperately seeking access to the ""cool"" that, as Norman Mailer famously noted, has in postwar urban America been inexorably associated with blackness.

It’s still things that’s relevant to this time period, but I just wanted “in your face” lyrics, real hard, soulful; just a big kaleidoscope of music, a little bit of everything, somethin’ for everybody. GW: Do you feel a lot of rappers in the game are doing music as a side job? Quest: I wouldn’t even say that. The way hip-hop is to the younger people is that it’s really no talent involved. A lot of people think they can just jump on the microphone, go, “yayayaya…” on beat and it sound good. That’s not really what it is, you know what I’m sayin? Back in the day, you couldn’t just get on the mic and rap. Right now, it’s easy to get $500 together, get a audio interface, a microphone, some beats on SoundClick, and call yourself a rapper. I think that’s a little too easy. If I get a chance, I at least try to school some of the younger, upcoming rappers. Try to incorporate some lyrics. Learn a lil’ bit about what’s goin’ on in hip-hop before you just jump into a song. People think rap is easy and it’s really not if you do it right. We’re just makin’ hip-hop wack. If the average listener listens to somebody who’s a local and they promotin’ their mixtape, or whatever, and it’s corny, they’re not gonna take the chance to listen to nobody else. Music is so quick and disposable now, you got even mainstream artists doin’ two or three mixtapes a year now. They would put out an album every two or three years. GW: On “Dat Knock,” you address a female. Are you drawn to a female’s intellect before her body or what covers it? Quest: For females walkin’ around with a Gucci bag, Prada shoes, a Gucci hat, whatever, that’s not gon’ define who she is when that’s not on her. Have a conversation, your shoes, hat, and purse is not gon’ talk to you. That’s cool for the time bein’, I’m with somebody now, but if I’m with somebody, they have to have some type of conversation. Once you get out the club, you gotta talk. I want to know where you at. God forbid, we in a situation, I need you to be on point. I need you to be intelligent enough to make a rational decision. Who wouldn’t want a woman who doesn’t do that? GW: Is the rap game a dream, like the title of your track, “The Dream?”
Quest: One of my theories is, rap is gonna become fly fishin’. You know how people in the ‘90s just go fly fishin’? It’s gonna be like that with hip-hop, where people are just old, they still love hip-hop, still make hip-hop, and still have love and a drive for hip-hop. If I wanna make beats at 60, I’m gonna make a beat. Just like when you go to the basketball court, it be like 50, 60-year-old dudes out there say, “I got next.” If you still successful within yourself, takin’ care of business, I say do what you wanna do. GW: Do you always do what you want to do with your music or do you compromise with other artists? Quest: I have to compromise when it comes to production jobs. As long as I don’t do anything too crazy, off the wall, nobody will say anything to me. They [managers and JSL] kinda trust my judgment when I’m makin’ music. I try not to say, “I’ma do this ‘cause such and such is doin’ this.” I’ma do what comes from my heart and soul when it comes to music. I ain’t gon’ try to force feed you anything. GW: You have a song called, “UShudaKnown.” What’s something you feel everyone should know? Quest: We had a conversation in the studio about Illuminati. Illuminati is the big thing in hip-hop and I think that’s pretty lame. There’s things that need a little more time and devotion than Illuminati. I think people are lookin’ too deep into things and not realizing that it’s music. This is just a term brought up now to have somethin’ to talk about, targetin’ hip-hop.

I think I got it locked, just smooth while I latch it
Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest, Steve Biko
My pen taps the paper and my brain's blank
Nas, Memory Lane
I'm voices in your subconscious, knots in your intestines
Crescent moon attack stance if you glance at the mic
-Casual from Hieroglyphics, Dune Methane
I'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells
Now come aboard, it's Medina bound
Enter the chamber, and it's a whole different sound
It's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel
So deep it's picked up on radios in tunnels
GZA from the Wu-Tang Clan, Liquid Swords
And, of course, some words from the master:
Wait by the radio hand on the dial soon
As you hear it, pump up the volume
Dance with the speaker til you hear it blow
Then plug in your headphone because there it go
And, most tellingly:
I am the R, to the A to the KIM
If I wasn't, why would I say I am? Rakim, Pump up the Volume and As the Rhyme Goes On. Please excuse me for starting this with so many quotes, but once I start quoting great hip-hop songs, it is hard for me to stop. I also wanted to introduce this without introduction, showing hip-hop as it is without discussing the political and social viewpoints and misviewpoints first. I first started listening to hip-hop when I bought a Public Enemy tape in 1994, and I immediately responded to the message. For me, Public Enemy wasn't that much different from Neil Young, both were putting righteous anger to music. But I liked the sound itself, and soon enough, I started branching out into other hip-hop acts, but mostly ones with some sort of message, even if it was the more subtle messages of say, De La Soul. Substance was important for me. The fact that half of rap consisted of bragging seemed to be a necessary evil. Some of those songs and lyrics inspired me, but I always associated them somehow with something else, perhaps as an extension of the messages I heard in other lyrics. If you ask hip-hop fans how they got started, and you will hear many different stories, but this one isn't uncommon. For middle class kids, social consciousness is often the reason to start listening to hip-hop. There is currently about twenty years of debate and warfare in hip-hop about what constitutes hip-hop, with the authenticity of various viewpoints challenged. Many socially conscious rappers and fans feel that rap with criminal themes is a marketing plot to sell fantasies to suburbanites, while I imagine many fans of gritty street rap would feel that rap engineered to be friendly to academic vegan anarchists is not, in fact, keeping it real. All of this is incorrect. What the proper topic for rap was occurred to me when I read words of Martin Buber in I and Thou: that the experience of the I and Thou is a transaction that does not have content. I tried to imagine a relationship, a transaction, without content, and it sprang to mind: hip-hop lyrics! Lyrics with a capital L, the type of hip-hop lyrics that are written to be purely about the writing, performing and listening to of the song. Lyrics about themselves! Even though many hip-hop lyrics do not have any content, a relationship is still established between the performer and listener. The proper subject of hip-hop is neither political revolution, or criminal exploits. The proper subject of hip-hop is the creation of hip-hop itself. As the Wu-Tang Clan puts it, merely in the process of ""living out their name"", of defining and defending themselves, an MC exists. It isn't that hip-hop can't have content, that it can't communicate ideas from an unlucky road trip to the identification of the ten sefiroth and ten Dharma realms, it is that all of these subjects, no matter how meaningful, are not interrupted by bragging without content. They are founded in it. Again, let us look at Rakim, speaking with what has to be playful recursion and profound religious meaning:
I am the R to the A to the KIM
If I wasn't why would I say I am

""Hip-Hop was never a fad, it was always a permanent thing."" - Toine

Can you remember the first Hip-Hop song you ever heard and what feelings it inspired in you? Toine: I don’t really remember one that stood out. I grew up with it, so to distinguish a song as Hip-Hop and not Hip-Hop, I never even thought about it. I was lucky enough—or I don’t even know if I’m lucky enough—to grow up always having rap as an option. I’m not old enough to have had R&B be the main level of music for the youth. Hip-Hop was never a fad it was always a permanent thing. I remember being really young, I guess like two years old my mom had me on tape talking about “Too Legit to Quit.” And “Gin and Juice.” I was sipping lemon juice since I didn’t know what Gin was back then. Those two songs stand out in my earliest memories. Who were the artists whose career and work has been a source of inspiration to you? Toine: I’ll have to say Common from about '94 to '05…I feel like Common with his albums really grows [as an artist]…I don’t think he really made the same album twice. He’ll make an album then give a more polished feel on it in the next one…when he was Common Sense he was weird, he was sharp, extremely sharp and he was a real serious battle rap cat. He was the first rapper I really paid attention to with intellectual punchlines. He would have “I’m nicer than you, I’m this and that,” but a lot of his lines that had punch to them would be really introspective stuff that kind of made you think. When I really first started writing I was modeling myself after Common of that era. What do you consider some of the most influential contributions made to Hip-Hop in the past 40 years? Toine: Sheesh okay. I guess the invention of rapping over breaks [laughs]. If no one ever rapped over breaks whatever we have today would not exist in the same way. DJs would still be the kings and not the rappers—which I have no problem with but I feel like it should be about the music and not everything else. But just the thought of people rapping over breaks that makes Hip-Hop what it is today. Where do you see Hip-Hop evolving in the next 40 years given its current direction? Toine: I really don’t know. Hip-Hop follows the people and if the people stay on this trajectory I can see this, not ceasing to exist but…people’s appreciation for music dwindle. It’s too easy to put music out. The internet is giving people a false sense of entitlement, putting them on a pedestal that may or may not be warranted. The music industry as a whole is uh—quality control is a thing of the past. I’m not really as optimistic about the quality of the music…I hope it will be good. What do you consider your generation’s great contribution to Hip-Hop? Toine: …We’re a lot more technologically savvy. I feel we embrace more alternatives than rap. A lot of people, even Hip-Hop artists, are into more genres than rap, and even incorporate non-historically Black styles into their music now.

For that reason, if we’re going to present a society that has cohesion, then these art venues have to present the arts that come from all different sides of the community, particularly an art form that doesn’t say this is only for this type of person. Hip Hop just doesn’t say that. Could you talk about Hip Hop as an umbrella term in terms of Dance? As far as Hip Hop Culture is concerned, Breakin’ is the only form that was developing at the time period in The Bronx. However, within the disenfranchised black communities in the West, the same type of dance form, which was used as a language of the people, was simultaneously developing and that is what connects these forms together. Now for me, I’ve never been to a Hip Hop jam and seen dancers there that are only Bboys or Bgirls, I’ve always seen Popper’s or Krump dancers. I’ve never been to a Poppin’ jam and not seen breakers throwing down. So for me, the segregation of it is detail but the reality doesn’t sum it up for me. I see Break Dance, Poppin’ and Lockin’ all in the same place because it’s the same generation. The roots of one form might be from one side of America and another form from the other side of America, but actually, to only think of those two places in the whole world of the dance culture of the disenfranchised, I think it limits the potential of what we can do when it comes to unifying our language. Who are your favourite Hip Hop artists? Historically, Ken swift, who is a Bboy. He will always mention. Megus. He’s a Canadian Bboy. He has some incredible threading techniques. KRS ONE. No doubt he will always be a major influence for me being a MC. Black Thought from The Roots. I connected with Black Thought when he first came to England and their first show in London they invited me on stage to be apart of their set (the first ever gig they did in London). Where graffiti writers are concerned, I really love DAIM from Germany. He’s got this dope 3D style. I also like ODEITH he did a piece at Breakin’ Convention three years ago. He’s got this really unique special effects style which involves doing a piece on a corner and depending on where you stand it looks like its coming out. It’s incredible. In South Africa there’s a MC called Hymphatic Thabs. He’s onto the next level. Very underground but I think he’s an incredible MC. Audio/Visual which were a collective of MCS that were pushing the form in the mid to late 90’s. Kendrick Lemar mainly for that brilliant album and MF DOOM because he’s just always pushing the boundaries lyrically. He’s got a very monotone style, which makes him a bit like marmite. You either love him or you just don’t get it. What do you think is the future of Hip Hop? I am going answer this question how I feel everyone should answer this question — like what Mos Def said:
‘Don’t worry about what Hip Hop is doing, worry about what you’re doing’
and it makes me then say Hip Hop theatre is going to go global just like what we’re doing with Breakin Convention. We’re doing four dates in America. We’re also doing Canada and Luxembourg. Sweden and Holland are both interested. So, there is a global thing going on with Breakin’ Convention. I also think that the forms of Grime for example will have an influence, which I think are Hip Hop. Again, we’re are just trying to divide and make everything super detailed when we have so much more in common than we do apart. I’m quite keen to say that it’s part of the world, however you want to say it. I would like to think that it’s all connected. I think that in this increasingly fascist system that the world is going through, not just England and America, that a lot of the media is pressurising us to fight amongst ourselves. I think this is in response to the obvious imbalance in resources. The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer, so it doesn’t surprise me that the media will try to enforce on us things that make us start arguing amongst ourselves. Hip Hop is the antithesis of that so I believe that Hip Hop is going to be responsible for helping to heal society.","[{'passage': ""Everyone I had worked with on my early projects is gone -- they’ve all been fired and there are new guys coming in that think they can teach old dogs new tricks. They bring these people in and give them job functions that had been covered by multiple people in the past. It makes it hard to know what to expect from the records. What sort of impact do you think this has had on music itself? There’s no lack of interesting and good music coming out, it’s just the way the system works now. I’d like to have the comfort of thinking that everything that has happened to me hasn’t been luck; it’s been me making good decisions. When I don’t understand what’s going on, I just try to sit and watch. It’s about trying to fit into the scheme of where things are going in the future. I’m an artist that wrote about the harsh realities and that’s always what’s translated the strongest about my music. In film thusfar, I’ve only taken on characters that embodied the same mannerisms or attitudes. I’m trying to broaden peoples' perception of me, so that when they see me they don’t pigeonhole me as being only able to do one thing. Does the evolving industry make it more difficult for you to make music or does it have no impact whatsoever? It’s hard if you’re not in a position where the machine is behind you non-stop. I’m lucky to be an artist that doesn’t have to look for press. If I say anything controversial in this interview, they’ll take this and run it on all the blogs. What do you think about the evolution of hip-hop from gangsta archetypes to skinny jean-wearing hyper-emotional types? It’s missing what I fell in love with about hip-hop culture. There’s almost no one creating or making the type of hip-hop that I grew up on. I’m a huge Ice Cube fan — I still watch Cube like I’ve never sold a record. I still watch his interviews and study him. He came from the position where his music reflected the aggressions and harsh realities of life, and now he’s highly respected on a broader scope. You can see a television show based on a movie he made. It’s interesting to watch someone's personal choices and how they impact their career. Dre is different from me — his relationship with Jimmy Iovine will allow him to stay relevant regardless of what he does. He can stay home for another 10 years and then put out a record and it will get tons of promotion... He’ll always be a priority. Whatever happened with the Rick Ross feud? Did you ever talk to him and clear the air? I never had a conversation with him. My focus shifted during that record. A lot of times, earlier in my career, I was competing with artists because that was what I loved about hip-hop: The idea that battling someone was necessary to defend your spot and you had to take on all challengers — so I did that constantly. No one thinks that way now and everyone looks at me like I’m the Broad Street Bully. The younger kids coming up missed that time frame, and even the conscious rap is gone, too. The stuff that Common Sense and Talib Kweli and Mos Def were rhyming about. What was socially conscious and responsible about the music has been replaced by hipster kids in skinny jeans and mohawks. Of course, that’s always been around, but it was usually confined to the Village. Artists have always had the opportunity to influence the culture, but now it’s the other way around: They’re trying to look like their audience to attract their audience. Now you can’t tell the difference between a Led Zeppelin fan and a hip-hop fan. Do you think this is just part of a natural ebb and flow of cultural change? It’s a cyclical shift. It’s like fashion, everything is recycled and comes back. I’m really excited by it. Sometimes, it’s best to just take a look at what’s going on and observe. On my first album, I was writing to one concept. With “Black Magic,” I wrote a bunch of material, but now I have time to spend on what I have to offer.

I think the way that kids grow up now, that with social media they get it all at once. Like, the coolest table in the cafeteria is probably the most mixed table of all. It\'s got the coolest black kids, it\'s got the coolest white kids, it\'s got the coolest Asian kids, it\'s got the coolest girls, the coolest guys, the jocks, the coolest nerd, you see what I\'m saying? It\'s the mixture. Even with Florida Georgia Line, they\'re some pretty young guys they\'re like 27, you look at Nelly, this is my 16th year so those guys [knew me] since they were freakin\' 11, I hate to say that shit [Laughs.] They\'ve been influenced by myself and things of that nature, so when they come to the music they have no choice but to put some of the influence of what they\'ve been listening to. Well this year marks the 15th anniversary of Country Grammar. What did you do differently on that record, compared to how you make records now? Man, it\'s a great saying, ""You have a lifetime to make your first record, you got a year to make every one after that."" That\'s basically it. When you\'re talking about Country Grammar, man, we were waiting since I started rapping to make that album. How was it different technically? It\'s a difference in the sound. I was kinda the only one doing what I was doing, now the whole fucking game is singing. [Laughs.] The whole game is melodic now, and I was the only one doing it. You know? I was the first one to sing his own hook, rap his own verses and sing his own bridge. And continuously doing that because my influences, such as Bone Thugs, Goodie Mob, Cee-Lo Green and Arrested Development, you\'re listening to \'em and trying to find your own niche and then when you come with it but you come with it in a way that\'s so surprising to people. People don\'t understand that, shit, the whole game is doing Nelly. Do you get rappers saying, ""Thanks for hooking this up. Thanks for making this happen?"" Nah man, it\'s all good. Obviously, when you meet other artists, other artists definitely show their appreciation. . . . It\'s kind of hard to find someone that sings and raps that wasn\'t a Nelly fan. And it\'s a little easier to do it now because of Auto-Tune. I didn\'t have Auto-Tune. That was straight my notes. I had to work that shit out. I had to actually hit notes. Are you anti-Auto-Tune? No, no, no. I\'m not anti-anything. It\'s just used so much now, it just sounds like the norm. That\'s why I say I\'m not ""anti."" One thing I know and I understand is evolution. Everything must change. . . . Hip-hop was created by the youth for the youth. So, you got to let the youth take it where they\'re gonna take it. If you want to be involved, be involved. If you don\'t, you don\'t. It\'s getting to a point now where hip-hop has a history. Older people, when I was younger, they didn\'t have hip-hop. If they didn\'t like it, they just listened to whatever they wanted to do. Now I\'m a parent. I had hip-hop, so I don\'t have to listen to their hip hop. I can listen to my hip-hop. But we\'re still listening to hip-hop. Listen, I could be 65 years old, if Jay-Z\'s having a concert, I\'m there. We\'re in a different era now. I\'m not gonna never stop wearing Jordans. I mean unless another company gives me a hellafied check to stop wearing \'em. I don\'t care if I\'m 80, I\'mma put on some sneakers.

Hip-hop artists of all stripes are constantly sampling, referencing, and quoting artists from the past, creatively reconstructing their family trees. Every once in a while, an emcee takes this to the next level. They become lyrical historians, narrating the evolution of hip-hop and its art forms. I’ve always been a sucker for this genre of song, ever since I was a kid in the Boston suburbs scanning the radio dial intently to learn everything I could about this incredible sound coming from the nation’s urban centers. In this post, I share twelve songs about hip-hop history, some famous and some lesser known. Unless you’re extremely well-informed, it’ll probably take some additional research to get all the references (Rap Genius can help, http://rap.genius.com/). For teachers, these songs could come in handy as prompts for classroom discussions. For example, conversations about what these songs include, and what they leave out, could be extremely informative. These songs don’t really tell the whole story. They are pretty US-heavy and overly-nostalgic, and there are plenty of gaps. For one, I couldn’t find any written by women (if you know any, please comment!). Still, if you’re looking to dive into hip-hop’s roots, here are some guides to lead you. 1. South Bronx, by Boogie Down Productions\nIt’s generally agreed that hip-hop as we know it today first emerged in the South Bronx, so there’s no better song to start with than South Bronx, by KRS-One and Scott LaRock. This song was written in response to MC Shan and DJ Marley Marl’s, The Bridge, which claimed Queens, NY, as hip-hop’s birthplace. It’s clear today who won this argument. 2. Knowledge is Power, by Akala\nOf course, hip-hop didn’t appear in the South Bronx out of nowhere. It’s roots lie deep in African, African-American, Afro-Caribbean, and Latin American musical and oral traditions. In Knowledge is Power, UK-based emcee Akala calls the Bronx-based origin story a “myth,” and argues that those who love hip-hop need to look much deeper into its antecedents. 3.

Gangsta Rap, by Ice T\nHip-hop may have originally coalesced in New York, but it quickly spread. In Gangsta Rap, Ice T recounts how hip-hop was picked up by artists on the West Coast. There, hip-hop and local gang culture converged to birth West coast gangsta rap, which then took the world by storm (for good and ill). 5. Latinos Stand Up (Remix), by Chino XL, Sick Jacken, Thirstin Howl, B Real, Sinful, and Kid Frost\nLatinos artists have been part of hip-hop’s evolution since its birth, but have often been unrecognized for their contributions. In this song, some of the most well-known Latino rappers join together to represent for the Latin hip-hop tradition. 6. Underground Heaven, by Cesar Comanche\nUnderground Heaven highlights the central role of the DJ/Producer in creating the sound we recognize today as hip-hop music. It’s something of an ode to the independent record store and the sample, and has a great verse that rolls through some of the most classic samples in hip-hop. 7.

Lyrics about law enforcement, for example, frequently portrayed cops as predators exercising an illegitimate power. Imprisonment, likewise, was blamed for weakening familial and community relationships and described a modern method of oppression. The study’s authors concluded that “the overwhelming message in hip-hop wasn’t that the rappers disliked the idea of justice, but they disliked the way it was being implemented.” More insights from the authors via Meredith Mohr:\n“[T]he music is maturing, evolving,” Henderson said. “Take Jay-Z for example. If you look at his lyrical content from 1990-2012, you see the evolution from talking about drug selling at the beginning of his career to now talking about meeting with the president, helping with the campaign. It’s a very different conversation. We never saw an artist go backwards. You only saw them mature as they age, and experience and their music changes with them.”\nPart of this, Henderson said, is because the audience has also changed with the artists. “Jay-Z’s listenership has aged with him,” Henderson said. “Part of it is that artists recognize that if they go back and talk about that very animalistic behavior, their listeners are going to say, ‘hey listen, this is not what I want to hear,’ and they’re going to go somewhere else.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:ec126d0e-d5ee-40c1-930e-ecb573472b2c>']}, {'passage': 'spawned a new breed of rapper, styled as gun-toting hoodlum supposedly giving suburban America a frightening peek into ghetto life the group knew from pretty early on that about 80 percent of the people buying their albums were white, middle-class kids. Although the industry was happy to cash in, pressure by conservative advocacy groups on major corporations such as Time Warner (parent company of TIME.com) resulted in the industry backing away from promoting gangsta rap. ""Hip-Hop Nation"" includes original correspondence detailing efforts by Ice-T to be released from his Warner Brothers contract after the corporation had sought to curb certain lyrics. Gangsta rap, with its narrative tales and its cinematic funk-driven sound, offered a distinct alternative to the tricky bebop gymnastics of the freestyling East Coast. But hip-hop came close to destroying itself in the mid-\'90s when that bicoastal rivalry almost turned into a shooting war, as Tupac Shakur between surviving shootings and spells in prison threatened the life of Brooklyn rapper the Notorious B.I.G. and both men, former friends, were by the end of 1997 dead in as-yet-unsolved drive-by shootings. But while most hip-hop fans today may be well versed in the tale of Tupac and Biggie, the show transports them back to an era they may find hard to imagine. After all, the almost pharaonic fantasy world of a Puffy Combs video is light-years away from the hand-stenciled mimeographs with crude sketches advertising an around-the-way appearance of Kurtis Blow or a block party featuring Grandmaster Flash. This was a do-it yourself movement in the outer boroughs, a culture being built by hand, brick by brick one to which the suits running the music industry in the glass towers across the river were mostly impervious for more than a decade. And for kids grown accustomed to hip-hop as the bearer of grim tales of death and destruction, ""Hip-Hop Nation"" offers a glimpse of a reminder that the cultural roots were in joyous block parties and people having getting together to have a good time no matter how grim their circumstances. That much is summed up in the words of one pioneering DJ carried in a video installation: ""If there was negativity and fights breaking out at your party, that means your DJ was whack."" IT WAS AT THOSE PARTIES in the ""Boogie Down"" South Bronx where hip-hop\'s founding fathers Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaata and Grandmaster Flash first began delivering spoken rhymes over the break beats on funk and disco records sometime in the mid-\'70s. Today the signature beats-and-rhymes combination of the musical art form they created is as ubiquitous in America\'s tony suburbs as in its forgotten housing projects, and has kids in distant parts of the world whose first language may be French or Japanese or Wolof chanting choruses inviting their friends to ""get at me, dawg."" Hip-hop\'s language not simply its slang, which is as likely to be heard in Yale dorm rooms as on inner-city street corners, but its idiom, which involves combining the spoken (or screamed) word with a pastiche of musical elements drawn from previous songs and styles reassembled in new and unique combinations is not only the preeminent musical genre of a generation, it\'s also a complex, ever-evolving organism that has spawned countless dialects that are constantly in conversation with one another. HIP-HOP CULTURE may be difficult to define, but it is pervasive nonetheless. It began simply as a combination of four art forms deejaying, rapping, break dancing and graffiti tagging but it quickly evolved into a cultural revolution in which young African-Americans literally remade their America. In the spirit of Malcolm X and the Black Panthers, they didn\'t simply demand to be admitted as an equal in Whitey\'s world; they created their own popular culture grounded in the lived reality and aspirations of black life in America. Far from demanding to join the club, the hip-hop kids created their own. And once they\'d built it, Whitey came, desperately seeking access to the ""cool"" that, as Norman Mailer famously noted, has in postwar urban America been inexorably associated with blackness.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:4186a596-cbc5-4679-858a-47c8818bb34f>']}, {'passage': 'It’s still things that’s relevant to this time period, but I just wanted “in your face” lyrics, real hard, soulful; just a big kaleidoscope of music, a little bit of everything, somethin’ for everybody. GW: Do you feel a lot of rappers in the game are doing music as a side job? Quest: I wouldn’t even say that. The way hip-hop is to the younger people is that it’s really no talent involved. A lot of people think they can just jump on the microphone, go, “yayayaya…” on beat and it sound good. That’s not really what it is, you know what I’m sayin? Back in the day, you couldn’t just get on the mic and rap. Right now, it’s easy to get $500 together, get a audio interface, a microphone, some beats on SoundClick, and call yourself a rapper. I think that’s a little too easy. If I get a chance, I at least try to school some of the younger, upcoming rappers. Try to incorporate some lyrics. Learn a lil’ bit about what’s goin’ on in hip-hop before you just jump into a song. People think rap is easy and it’s really not if you do it right. We’re just makin’ hip-hop wack. If the average listener listens to somebody who’s a local and they promotin’ their mixtape, or whatever, and it’s corny, they’re not gonna take the chance to listen to nobody else.

Have a conversation, your shoes, hat, and purse is not gon’ talk to you. That’s cool for the time bein’, I’m with somebody now, but if I’m with somebody, they have to have some type of conversation. Once you get out the club, you gotta talk. I want to know where you at. God forbid, we in a situation, I need you to be on point. I need you to be intelligent enough to make a rational decision. Who wouldn’t want a woman who doesn’t do that? GW: Is the rap game a dream, like the title of your track, “The Dream?”\nQuest: One of my theories is, rap is gonna become fly fishin’. You know how people in the ‘90s just go fly fishin’? It’s gonna be like that with hip-hop, where people are just old, they still love hip-hop, still make hip-hop, and still have love and a drive for hip-hop. If I wanna make beats at 60, I’m gonna make a beat.

I also wanted to introduce this without introduction, showing hip-hop as it is without discussing the political and social viewpoints and misviewpoints first. I first started listening to hip-hop when I bought a Public Enemy tape in 1994, and I immediately responded to the message. For me, Public Enemy wasn\'t that much different from Neil Young, both were putting righteous anger to music. But I liked the sound itself, and soon enough, I started branching out into other hip-hop acts, but mostly ones with some sort of message, even if it was the more subtle messages of say, De La Soul. Substance was important for me. The fact that half of rap consisted of bragging seemed to be a necessary evil. Some of those songs and lyrics inspired me, but I always associated them somehow with something else, perhaps as an extension of the messages I heard in other lyrics. If you ask hip-hop fans how they got started, and you will hear many different stories, but this one isn\'t uncommon. For middle class kids, social consciousness is often the reason to start listening to hip-hop. There is currently about twenty years of debate and warfare in hip-hop about what constitutes hip-hop, with the authenticity of various viewpoints challenged. Many socially conscious rappers and fans feel that rap with criminal themes is a marketing plot to sell fantasies to suburbanites, while I imagine many fans of gritty street rap would feel that rap engineered to be friendly to academic vegan anarchists is not, in fact, keeping it real. All of this is incorrect. What the proper topic for rap was occurred to me when I read words of Martin Buber in I and Thou: that the experience of the I and Thou is a transaction that does not have content. I tried to imagine a relationship, a transaction, without content, and it sprang to mind: hip-hop lyrics! Lyrics with a capital L, the type of hip-hop lyrics that are written to be purely about the writing, performing and listening to of the song. Lyrics about themselves! Even though many hip-hop lyrics do not have any content, a relationship is still established between the performer and listener. The proper subject of hip-hop is neither political revolution, or criminal exploits. The proper subject of hip-hop is the creation of hip-hop itself. As the Wu-Tang Clan puts it, merely in the process of ""living out their name"", of defining and defending themselves, an MC exists. It isn\'t that hip-hop can\'t have content, that it can\'t communicate ideas from an unlucky road trip to the identification of the ten sefiroth and ten Dharma realms, it is that all of these subjects, no matter how meaningful, are not interrupted by bragging without content. They are founded in it.

Photo courtesy of Orlando Urbina\nCan you remember the first Hip-Hop song you ever heard and what feelings it inspired in you? Toine: I don’t really remember one that stood out. I grew up with it, so to distinguish a song as Hip-Hop and not Hip-Hop, I never even thought about it. I was lucky enough—or I don’t even know if I’m lucky enough—to grow up always having rap as an option. I’m not old enough to have had R&B be the main level of music for the youth. Hip-Hop was never a fad it was always a permanent thing. I remember being really young, I guess like two years old my mom had me on tape talking about “Too Legit to Quit.” And “Gin and Juice.” I was sipping lemon juice since I didn’t know what Gin was back then. Those two songs stand out in my earliest memories. Who were the artists whose career and work has been a source of inspiration to you? Toine: I’ll have to say Common from about \'94 to \'05…I feel like Common with his albums really grows [as an artist]…I don’t think he really made the same album twice. He’ll make an album then give a more polished feel on it in the next one…when he was Common Sense he was weird, he was sharp, extremely sharp and he was a real serious battle rap cat. He was the first rapper I really paid attention to with intellectual punchlines. He would have “I’m nicer than you, I’m this and that,” but a lot of his lines that had punch to them would be really introspective stuff that kind of made you think. When I really first started writing I was modeling myself after Common of that era. What do you consider some of the most influential contributions made to Hip-Hop in the past 40 years? Toine: Sheesh okay. I guess the invention of rapping over breaks [laughs]. If no one ever rapped over breaks whatever we have today would not exist in the same way. DJs would still be the kings and not the rappers—which I have no problem with but I feel like it should be about the music and not everything else. But just the thought of people rapping over breaks that makes Hip-Hop what it is today. Where do you see Hip-Hop evolving in the next 40 years given its current direction? Toine: I really don’t know. Hip-Hop follows the people and if the people stay on this trajectory I can see this, not ceasing to exist but…people’s appreciation for music dwindle. It’s too easy to put music out. The internet is giving people a false sense of entitlement, putting them on a pedestal that may or may not be warranted. The music industry as a whole is uh—quality control is a thing of the past. I’m not really as optimistic about the quality of the music…I hope it will be good. What do you consider your generation’s great contribution to Hip-Hop? Toine: …We’re a lot more technologically savvy. I feel we embrace more alternatives than rap. A lot of people, even Hip-Hop artists, are into more genres than rap, and even incorporate non-historically Black styles into their music now.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:fe1b6d7e-9131-416c-ae8a-de6aa28f17f9>']}, {'passage': 'For that reason, if we’re going to present a society that has cohesion, then these art venues have to present the arts that come from all different sides of the community, particularly an art form that doesn’t say this is only for this type of person. Hip Hop just doesn’t say that. Could you talk about Hip Hop as an umbrella term in terms of Dance? As far as Hip Hop Culture is concerned, Breakin’ is the only form that was developing at the time period in The Bronx. However, within the disenfranchised black communities in the West, the same type of dance form, which was used as a language of the people, was simultaneously developing and that is what connects these forms together. Now for me, I’ve never been to a Hip Hop jam and seen dancers there that are only Bboys or Bgirls, I’ve always seen Popper’s or Krump dancers. I’ve never been to a Poppin’ jam and not seen breakers throwing down. So for me, the segregation of it is detail but the reality doesn’t sum it up for me. I see Break Dance, Poppin’ and Lockin’ all in the same place because it’s the same generation. The roots of one form might be from one side of America and another form from the other side of America, but actually, to only think of those two places in the whole world of the dance culture of the disenfranchised, I think it limits the potential of what we can do when it comes to unifying our language. Who are your favourite Hip Hop artists? Historically, Ken swift, who is a Bboy. He will always mention. Megus. He’s a Canadian Bboy. He has some incredible threading techniques. KRS ONE. No doubt he will always be a major influence for me being a MC. Black Thought from The Roots. I connected with Black Thought when he first came to England and their first show in London they invited me on stage to be apart of their set (the first ever gig they did in London). Where graffiti writers are concerned, I really love DAIM from Germany. He’s got this dope 3D style. I also like ODEITH he did a piece at Breakin’ Convention three years ago. He’s got this really unique special effects style which involves doing a piece on a corner and depending on where you stand it looks like its coming out. It’s incredible. In South Africa there’s a MC called Hymphatic Thabs. He’s onto the next level. Very underground but I think he’s an incredible MC. Audio/Visual which were a collective of MCS that were pushing the form in the mid to late 90’s. Kendrick Lemar mainly for that brilliant album and MF DOOM because he’s just always pushing the boundaries lyrically. He’s got a very monotone style, which makes him a bit like marmite. You either love him or you just don’t get it. What do you think is the future of Hip Hop? I am going answer this question how I feel everyone should answer this question — like what Mos Def said:\n‘Don’t worry about what Hip Hop is doing, worry about what you’re doing’\nand it makes me then say Hip Hop theatre is going to go global just like what we’re doing with Breakin Convention. We’re doing four dates in America. We’re also doing Canada and Luxembourg. Sweden and Holland are both interested. So, there is a global thing going on with Breakin’ Convention. I also think that the forms of Grime for example will have an influence, which I think are Hip Hop. Again, we’re are just trying to divide and make everything super detailed when we have so much more in common than we do apart. I’m quite keen to say that it’s part of the world, however you want to say it. I would like to think that it’s all connected. I think that in this increasingly fascist system that the world is going through, not just England and America, that a lot of the media is pressurising us to fight amongst ourselves. I think this is in response to the obvious imbalance in resources. The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer, so it doesn’t surprise me that the media will try to enforce on us things that make us start arguing amongst ourselves. Hip Hop is the antithesis of that so I believe that Hip Hop is going to be responsible for helping to heal society.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:a7ec318c-56c3-40b2-aaf9-a417c401e037>']}]","{

                ""text"": ""In circa 4 decades of existence in Belo Horizonte, hip-hop culture remains active through the participation of different generations of practitioners. Because it is a living and constantly changing phenomenon, contemporary hip-hop embraces new attributes as well as solidifies the learning that comes from the experience of the founding fathers (and mothers). As well as other contexts, it is possible to observe a process of aging of local audiences and artists of rap music. Although not with the same measure, it is possible to observe much of the issues reported by Forman (2013, 2014). However, generational differences are still not so visible in the local context. The local discussion on boom bap and trap is a suitable case for looking at differences between generations on a local level. Those who grew up listening to rap music in the 1990s have a natural tendency to value boom bap rap, while the younger ones value trap, a trend in contemporary rap music. Such predilections illustrate the formation of musical taste in each of the generations and reverberate the experience of the agents in local hip-hop culture at different times. Still, the choice for one or other style is not exclusive, since there are young people who like boom bap and older people who like trap. In this sense, the choice of rappers, DJs and beatmakers is based on the interest of diversifying their musicality; their relationship with the audience and the current context of mainstream rap, as well as the intention of being linked to less commercial (or underground) sub-genres. Furthermore, this debate also exposes some challenges of growing old at a local hip-hop scene, like being present in gigs and parties; communicating with new generations; being listened by a younger audience; not looking thematically and musically dated; being able to appreciate the musical aesthetics of the new generations; as well as being respected among the youngsters, without accessing an \u201cage-based authority\u201d (Forman 2014) that relies on arguments like \u201cI\u2019ve been there...\u201d or \u201cback in the days...\u201d. In Belo Horizonte, hip-hop is aging but is still young. This assumed contradiction is what makes it possible to embrace, sometimes in a conflicted way, an aesthetic and generational diversity.

Rappers could talk about how they were gonna kill their competitors with their lyrics, but it was never about guns..\nYeah, yeah, yeah! That's how it was. I got into\nHip-Hop when I was about ten or eleven, that was the only music that kind of interested\nme. When I was fifteen was when I started getting into working out the samples from other\nmusic and got interested in other music. When, say, Public Enemy was out there, sampling\nJames Brown's music, I would go and check some James Brown or whatever and that's how I\neventually bumped into Prince's stuff. But yeah, Hip-Hop's changed a lot. Now it's getting\na little more creative, I think, with some positive people like Timbaland and all that\nstuff. At least they're trying to be different. There were many years when it was the same\nold, same old, and everybody was just copying each other. Back in the day it was about\nbeing original and if you sounded like someone else you were really wack (laughs). But now\nit's like it's cool to sound like someone else. But it ain't! That's my whole mentality;\nI'm doing my music and sounding like someone else is not cool.

                ""text"": ""So that's something that I know I'm learning because like I'm at the, I mean, that weird in between area era between your era and the next era and looking at the two vibing, watching how it, especially in art world, I'm just like, well, both of y'all got great things to say, like take the best of the Bo of both worlds and put it together. And I think that is really presence when, when it comes to the idea of talking about street art and graffiti. And I noticed that's something that you're, that of course, part of your platform is something that you're big into. Could you speak a little bit about the evolution of that art form and where you see it going in the future and how the properly advocate for it? Because that's a part of the culture that I know a lot of the youth, they haven't understood. It has to come along with the music. It has to come along with the DJs and the B boys and the dancers that it was a VI visual art as part of hip [00:38:00] hop mm-hmm , it's true. So like, like the origins of it really is like, it started well, like, you know, to bring it back, a lot of people might feel like, oh, you know, like now you're seeing a lot of people who, who are, who are not black or brown, you know, doing it. Yeah. But it was always that way. It was for everybody. Yeah. Cause it was everybody doing graffiti back in the days, it was like, the thing was, you had. Punk rockers mm-hmm and hip hopers like hanging with each other. That's crazy. But that's what it was. Yeah. The coaches the coaches were are, and they still are like very, the pure part of the coaches, very similar to each other. So you had, you know, punk rockers writing, graffiti, hip hopers writing graffiti. And so that was always the thing. But then as, as hip hop began to be more organized in the sense, like people were saying, these are the elements. Man, I personally think through my studies, when you look at the DJ kind of like fading away eventually, so did like the graph part yeah. [00:39:00] Fade away. Yeah. And then the music became like the focus and that was, that was because the industry, the music industry itself found a way to make that control means capital gains. Yeah. Uhhuh, right? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. It means for capital gains and whatnot, and they couldn't see the value in those other things. And I, you know, so, so like those things are important. You know what I'm saying? So like, I had to go all way back just to say, like, for me, when I, and when I say hiphop and it's not any disrespect to anything being made now, cause I listen to everything. But when I, when I say hip hop culture music, it reflects that it will always have like hip hop itself will always have facets of, you know, I'm just gonna be honest misogyny in it. Yep. It's gonna have violence in it. It's gonna have you know, all those to me, negative element, but that's life, life has negative element also positive. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? But when you removed it, DJ, you removed, you removed hip [00:40:00] hop music itself, culture music itself. Cause it started with the DJ. So how could you remove the foundation? And if you remove the foundation, is that thing the same anymore? When you remove the foundation? No, it's not. So the music today is not hip hop music. That's an UN, that's an UN unpopular opinion for a lot of folks. I know that it is. But it's the truth. Like just do the history and you'll see that what I'm saying is what it is. It don't mean that the music's being made now ain't dope or whack or anything like that. What it means is it's just different. It's just different than where it came from. But, but, but check this one, are you not different than your parents? Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Are we, are, you, are, you, are, you are the best part of your parents. You're also different than them and that's okay. Yeah, exactly. Evolution for exactly, exactly that's evolution."",

                ""text"": ""North Carolinian hip-hop icon J. Cole ruffled a few purple hairs with the finale track of his newly released KOD album, 1985 (Intro to \u2018The Fall Off\u2019). Some clumsily labeled the record a \u201cdiss\u201d track at the millennial rap generation, namely Lil Pump: the 17-year-old Miami rapper who dropped an unprovoked \u201cF**k J. Cole\u201d diss song. But it\u2019s actually a page from Cole\u2019s 33-year-old book of wisdom that he was generous enough to share with the emerging rap generation beneath him without needing to resort to a \u201cdiss\u201d record. However, according to Coke Boys founder French Montana, \u201cevery generation of hip-hop\u201d is to be respected. The South Bronx native spoke with LA Weekly after a question about hip-hop enthusiasts who \u201chate\u201d on Lil Pump. French said that he loves what the rapper is doing for the rap game, though it isn\u2019t clear what that specifically is. \u201cI love what Tupac and Biggie did for the game, I also love what Run-DMC and them did for the game,\u201d he continued. \u201cI just feel like the game just changes.\u201d\nThe \u201cUnforgettable\u201d rapper championed the financially elevated lifestyle rap has afforded artists in this day and age as it \u201cjust shows growth.\u201d Without name-dropping anyone, French believes that anyone who doesn\u2019t like Pump shouldn\u2019t listen to him, anyway, especially since there are still lyrical artists existing in the current state of rap. \u201cWhatever kind of rap you want to listen to, go listen to it,\u201d he said. \u201cI love Lil Pump\u2019s music.\u201d\nAs aforementioned, French doesn't specifically name anyone, but also doesn\u2019t speak much to Pump\u2019s shots at Cole which\u2014if anyone could take a wild guess\u2014might presumably stem from not appreciating or liking the Dreamville leader as a \u201clyrical\u201d artist. He\u2019ll be happy to know he has at least one friend and fan in French. See the purple-haired rapper\u2019s new attempt at Cole\u2019s attention in the video below.

                ""text"": ""Something like \""Cruise\"" really does show how similar music from different parts of the country really can be. I think the way that kids grow up now, that with social media they get it all at once. Like, the coolest table in the cafeteria is probably the most mixed table of all. It's got the coolest black kids, it's got the coolest white kids, it's got the coolest Asian kids, it's got the coolest girls, the coolest guys, the jocks, the coolest nerd, you see what I'm saying? It's the mixture. Even with Florida Georgia Line, they're some pretty young guys they're like 27, you look at Nelly, this is my 16th year so those guys [knew me] since they were freakin' 11, I hate to say that shit [Laughs.] They've been influenced by myself and things of that nature, so when they come to the music they have no choice but to put some of the influence of what they've been listening to. Well this year marks the 15th anniversary of Country Grammar. What did you do differently on that record, compared to how you make records now? Man, it's a great saying, \""You have a lifetime to make your first record, you got a year to make every one after that.\"" That's basically it. When you're talking about Country Grammar, man, we were waiting since I started rapping to make that album. How was it different technically? It's a difference in the sound. I was kinda the only one doing what I was doing, now the whole fucking game is singing. [Laughs.] The whole game is melodic now, and I was the only one doing it. You know? I was the first one to sing his own hook, rap his own verses and sing his own bridge. And continuously doing that because my influences, such as Bone Thugs, Goodie Mob, Cee-Lo Green and Arrested Development, you're listening to 'em and trying to find your own niche and then when you come with it but you come with it in a way that's so surprising to people. People don't understand that, shit, the whole game is doing Nelly. Do you get rappers saying, \""Thanks for hooking this up. Thanks for making this happen?\"" Nah man, it's all good. Obviously, when you meet other artists, other artists definitely show their appreciation. . . . It's kind of hard to find someone that sings and raps that wasn't a Nelly fan. And it's a little easier to do it now because of Auto-Tune. I didn't have Auto-Tune. That was straight my notes. I had to work that shit out. I had to actually hit notes. Are you anti-Auto-Tune? No, no, no. I'm not anti-anything. It's just used so much now, it just sounds like the norm. That's why I say I'm not \""anti.\"" One thing I know and I understand is evolution. Everything must change. . . . Hip-hop was created by the youth for the youth. So, you got to let the youth take it where they're gonna take it. If you want to be involved, be involved. If you don't, you don't. It's getting to a point now where hip-hop has a history. Older people, when I was younger, they didn't have hip-hop. If they didn't like it, they just listened to whatever they wanted to do. Now I'm a parent. I had hip-hop, so I don't have to listen to their hip hop. I can listen to my hip-hop. But we're still listening to hip-hop. Listen, I could be 65 years old, if Jay-Z's having a concert, I'm there. We're in a different era now. I'm not gonna never stop wearing Jordans. I mean unless another company gives me a hellafied check to stop wearing 'em. I don't care if I'm 80, I'mma put on some sneakers. And it's just one of those things that back in the day, it was a certain way you had to dress if you were older. \""Why do you have that baseball cap on? C'mon, you're a 50 year-old man. Why do you have on a ball cap and sneakers?\"" Now, shit, it doesn't matter."",

(Getting Ready to Take Some Ground) Introduction: This is week four in our series “Eight Essential Exercises for Building a Better Body.” We’ve seen our need to find our strength in the Lord. Without His strength, we can’t even complete the rest of the exercises and our relationships will suffer. We’ve seen our need to make certain that our relationships are supported by and grounded in integrity. Without that belt of truth strapped around us, we cannot stand and our relationships crumble. Last week we considered the need to access the righteousness of Christ. We need to be right with God before we can be right in our relationships with others, and the way we get right with God is we allow the righteousness of Christ to be given to us. And then we ask him to fill us, to dwell in us and actually change our character so that we are truly a righteous people. This week we need to consider our need to be actively preparing to advance. The motto of the Boy Scouts is “always be prepared.” That’s a great motto, and Paul understood the need to be prepared. When he told us to have on, or put on the shoes of readiness that result from the Gospel he we was telling us to be prepared. A man without shoes is not prepared for much. In order to be prepared for action, a soldier on the front lines will sleep with his boots on at times. Having shoes on your feet is a symbol of readiness. It means you are prepared for action. You are prepared to go somewhere. When Merita and I take the kids and leave the house, the last thing we do is get shoes on all the kids. Once all of the shoes are on, then we are ready to go. You don’t leave the house to go someplace without shoes. Having your shoes on means that you’re ready. Paul knew that the soldier in his day wore shoes that kept him prepared for action. Often when we think of the shoes worn in the Mediterranean world of the first century we think of sandals. But the sandals worn by the Roman soldier were different than the sandals worn by the every day citizen. The sandals of the Roman soldier were designed for war, not for peace. When on duty he kept his sandals on so that he would be ready for action. To be prepared for combat you need quite a different shoe than you do for going to the corner store. These were specialized sandals. They had a thick sole to protect the soldiers feet from the hot sand and from sharp rocks. They also had nails driven through the soles, giving the sandals the ability to hold firm on sandy or slippery ground. Good footing was essential in winning a war and these shoes gave the soldier the good footing he needed. He wouldn’t slip or loose ground because the spikes would bite into the earth and help him hold firm. These shoes also helped the soldier to advance. A retreating army is rarely a winning army, but an army that can advance and take ground is an army that wins wars. The shoes of the soldier are designed for taking ground, advancing, and holding that ground, standing firm.",first turn question; Natural,"the initial question of a conversation, and therefore self-contained and understandable, without any other context.; phrased in the way people typically speak, reflecting everyday language use, without formal or artificial structure.",Expert,A specialized user with deep understanding of the corpus.,What was the strategic importance of the spiked soles in Roman military footwear?,"The spiked soles in Roman military footwear were strategically important because they helped soldiers maintain firm footing during battle, which was essential for winning wars. They prevented slipping on difficult terrain and enabled soldiers to both hold their ground and advance effectively, as a retreating army rarely wins wars, while an army that can advance and take ground is more likely to be victorious.","The Roman military footwear, known as caligae, featured a distinctive design with a series of raised, pointed metal studs on the sole. These spikes, or caligae calones, served several strategic purposes in the Roman army:

1. Traction: The primary function of the spikes was to provide excellent traction, especially in wet or muddy conditions. This was crucial for Roman soldiers who often fought in environments where footing could be slippery. The spikes allowed the soldiers to maintain their balance and move quickly across various terrains.

2. Durability: The metal studs also added durability to the sandals, protecting the sole from wear and tear that would otherwise occur from marching and combat. This ensured that the footwear could withstand the rigors of military campaigns.

3. Offensive capability: While primarily defensive, the spikes could also be used offensively. In close combat, the pointed calones could be used to deliver additional damage to an opponent, making the sandals a sort of improvised weapon.

4. Identification: The unique design of the caligae, including the spikes, was a distinctive feature that helped to identify Roman soldiers. This could be important for morale among the troops and as a psychological tool against enemies who recognized the formidable nature of the Roman army.

5. Mobility: Despite the added weight from the spikes, the caligae were designed to be lightweight and flexible, allowing Roman soldiers to move swiftly and maneuver easily in battle. This mobility was essential for the rapid tactics often employed by the Roman legions.

Overall, the spiked soles of the caligae were an integral part of Roman military footwear, providing a combination of practical benefits that enhanced the effectiveness of the Roman army on the battlefield.","You are a helpful assistant.

### Context: gymnasiums, and many taverns, baths and brothels. Throughout the territory under Rome's control, residential architecture ranged from very modest houses to country villas, and in the capital city of Rome, to the residences on the elegant Palatine Hill, from which the word ""palace"" is derived. The vast majority of the population lived in the city center, packed into apartment blocks. Most Roman towns and cities had a forum and temples, as did the city of Rome itself. Aqueducts were built to bring water to urban centers and wine and cooking oil were imported from abroad. Landlords generally resided in cities and their estates were left in the care of farm managers. To stimulate a higher labour productivity, many landlords freed large numbers of slaves. Beginning in the middle of the 2nd century BC, Greek culture was increasingly ascendant, in spite of tirades against the ""softening"" effects of Hellenised culture. By the time of Augustus, cultured Greek household slaves taught the Roman young (sometimes even the girls). Greek sculptures adorned Hellenistic landscape gardening on the Palatine or in the villas, and much Roman cuisine was essentially Greek. Roman writers disdained Latin for a cultured Greek style. Social history and structure
Many aspects of Roman culture were borrowed from the Greeks. In architecture and sculpture, the difference between Greek models and Roman paintings are apparent. The chief Roman contributions to architecture were the arch and the dome. Rome has also had a tremendous impact on European cultures following it. Its significance is perhaps best reflected in its endurance and influence, as is seen in the longevity and lasting importance of works of Virgil and Ovid. Latin, the Republic's primary language, remains used for liturgical purposes by the Roman Catholic Church, and up to the 19th century was used extensively in scholarly writings in, for example, science and mathematics. Roman law laid the foundations for the laws of many European countries and their colonies. The center of the early social structure was the family, which was not only marked by blood relations but also by the legally constructed relation of patria potestas. The Pater familias was the absolute head of the family; he was the master over his wife, his children, the wives of his sons, the nephews, the slaves and the freedmen, disposing of them and of their goods at will, even putting them to death. Roman law recognised only patrician families as legal entities. Slavery and slaves were part of the social order; there were slave markets where they could be bought and sold. Many slaves were freed by the masters for services rendered; some slaves could save money to buy their freedom. Generally, mutilation and murder of slaves was prohibited by legislation. It is estimated that over 25% of the Roman population was enslaved. Clothing and dining
Men typically wore a toga, and women a stola. The woman's stola looked different than a toga, and was usually brightly coloured. The cloth and the dress distinguished one class of people from the other class. The tunic worn by plebeians, or common people, like shepherds and slaves, was made from coarse and dark material, whereas the tunic worn by patricians was of linen or white wool. A knight or magistrate would wear an augusticlavus, a tunic bearing small purple studs. Senators wore tunics with broad red stripes, called tunica laticlavia. Military tunics were shorter than the ones worn by civilians. Boys, up until the festival of Liberalia, wore the toga praetexta, which was a toga with a crimson or purple border. The toga virilis, (or toga pura) was worn by men over the age of 16 to signify their citizenship in Rome. The toga picta was worn by triumphant generals and had embroidery of their skill on the battlefield. The toga pulla was worn when in mourning. Even footwear indicated a person's social status. Patricians wore red and orange sandals, senators had brown footwear, consuls had white shoes, and soldiers wore heavy boots. The Romans also invented socks for those soldiers required to fight on the northern frontiers, sometimes worn in sandals. Romans had simple food habits.

In a discussion of any ancient music, however, non-specialists and even many musicians have to be reminded that much of what makes our modern music familiar to us is the result of developments only within the last 1,000 years; thus, our ideas of melody, scales, harmony, and even the instruments we use would not be familiar to Romans who made and listened to music many centuries earlier. Over time, Roman architecture was modified as their urban requirements changed, and the civil engineering and building construction technology became developed and refined. The Roman concrete has remained a riddle, and even after more than 2,000 years some Roman structures still stand magnificently. The architectural style of the capitol city was emulated by other urban centers under Roman control and influence. Roman cities were well planned, efficiently managed and neatly maintained. Sports and entertainment
The city of Rome had a place called the Campus Martius (""Field of Mars""), which was a sort of drill ground for Roman soldiers. Later, the Campus became Rome's track and field playground. In the campus, the youth assembled to play and exercise, which included jumping, wrestling, boxing and racing. Equestrian sports, throwing, and swimming were also preferred physical activities. In the countryside, pastime included fishing and hunting. Board games played in Rome included dice (Tesserae or Tali), Roman Chess (Latrunculi), Roman Checkers (Calculi), Tic-tac-toe (Terni Lapilli), and Ludus duodecim scriptorum and Tabula, predecessors of backgammon. There were several other activities to keep people engaged like chariot races, musical and theatrical performances. Roman religious beliefs date back to the founding of Rome, around 800 BC. However, the Roman religion commonly associated with the republic and early empire did not begin until around 500 BC, when Romans came in contact with Greek culture, and adopted many of the Greek religious beliefs. Private and personal worship was an important aspect of religious practices. In a sense, each household was a temple to the gods. Each household had an altar (lararium), at which the family members would offer prayers, perform rites, and interact with the household gods. Many of the gods that Romans worshiped came from the Proto-Indo-European pantheon, others were based on Greek gods. The two most famous deities were Jupiter (the king God) and Mars (the god of war). With its cultural influence spreading over most of the Mediterranean, Romans began accepting foreign gods into their own culture, as well as other philosophical traditions such as Cynicism and Stoicism. This article is part of the series on:
Military of ancient Rome (portal)
753 BC – AD 476
Structural history Roman army (unit types and ranks, legions, auxiliaries, generals) Roman navy (fleets, admirals) Campaign history Lists of wars and battles Decorations and punishments Technological history Military engineering (castra, siege engines, arches, roads) Political history Strategy and tactics Infantry tactics Frontiers and fortifications (limes, Hadrian's Wall)
The structural history of the Roman military describes the major chronological transformations in the organisation and constitution of the Roman armed forces. The Roman military was split into the Roman army and the Roman navy, although these two branches were less distinct than they tend to be in modern defence forces. Within the top-level branches of army and navy, structural changes occurred both as a result of positive military reform and through organic structural evolution. Hoplite armies (509–c. 315 BC)
During this period, Roman soldiers seem to have been modelled after those of the Etruscans to the north, who themselves seem to have copied their style of warfare from the Greeks. Traditionally, the introduction of the phalanx formation into the Roman army is ascribed to the city's penultimate king, Servius Tullius (ruled 578 to 534 BC). According to Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the front rank was composed of the wealthiest citizens, who were able to purchase the best equipment. Each subsequent rank consisted of those with less wealth and poorer equipment than the one before it.

The chapter concludes with a brief but interesting review of recruitment, training and promotion--with an almost exclusively imperial focus. The fourth chapter, ""The Culture of the Roman Army,"" continues the handbook style/format. Following a brief section on ""physiognomy,"" by which Southern seems to mean the provenance of the recruits, we read of matters of morale, discipline, and traditions. Southern notes the privileged legal status of soldiers but notes as well that military discipline was apparently enforced with less rigor in the Empire than in the Republic and also less so in peacetime than in war. Punishments ranged from extra duty to loss of rank or pay to discharge and finally execution. Southern notes as well that soldiers were not entitled to leave or furlough but could apparently arrange privately with their commanders to be absent (literally at their own expense) from camp and the duty roster. The section on traditions explores unit names, decorations and medals, uniforms (from helmets to socks over several pages), military music, and holidays. The last include the specially ""military festivals"" of the Quinquatria on 19 March and the feast of Vesta on 9 June as well as the emperor's birthday and 21 April, the anniversary of the founding of the city. A section on veterans concludes the chapter; Southern explains the military diploma, the privileges and obligations, the state funded, one time, cash pensions of the retirees, and finally the exemptions from some taxes. Chapter five examines the subject of ""The Roman Army at War."" Southern opens with the traditional claim that ""From their earliest beginnings to the late empire, the Romans consistently adopted a warlike disposition""(171). That said, however, she believes that the Empire lacked a strategic plan: Romans tended to behave reactively in going to war and pragmatically in settling a conflict. Reflecting the defensive posture employed over much of imperial history, Southern devotes several pages (178-186) to frontiers and forts (with perhaps the book's most useful illustrations--diagrams of the Wallsend and Housestead forts on Hadrian's Wall). Under tactics and operational concepts are grouped the order of march (with examples taken from Polybius, Josephus and Arrian), marching and temporary camps, and battle. The chapter examines as well planning and staff work, command and control (including the difficult balance of aggression and diffidence that troubled imperial commanders like Corbulo and Agricola), and operations involving combined naval and ground forces. Rather unusually for this book but doubtlessly reflecting the sources, almost all of the information about the last dates from the Republic rather than the Empire. ""The Tools of War"" occupy chapter six, though in addition to weaponry Southern examines logistics, communications, medicine, technology and cartography. The weapons discussed include gladius, pilum, lancea, spatha, pugio, bows and arrows, artillery, and slingshots. Here more than anywhere else a selection of drawings or photographs would have been immensely helpful. While Southern does provide references to other authors, I would have traded several of the book's illustrations taken from the Library of Congress for genuine ""hardware"" here. In discussing logistics Southern points to the obvious differences between Republic and Empire when permanent forts and bases were the rule. Over several pages Southern discusses food and fodder requirements, the number of pack animals employed by a legion on the move, and the speed of transport/march. Of intelligence and communications Southern suggests that they worked much better on the local than the regional or imperial level; and so, as the frontiers became increasingly troublesome, emperors necessarily moved from Rome to where their presence was required. The discussion of medicine is brief, though Southern does demonstrate that the Romans made significant advances in the treatment of wounds and outbreaks of disease/illness in camp. Equally brief are the sections on technology and cartography, the former effectively equated with engineering and the latter with itineraries; again references indicate possibilities for more detailed study. Chapter seven, ""The Late Roman Army,"" returns to more traditional, historical narrative in the book's shortest chapter; here Southern provides a dramatically abridged but updated version of her 1996 work of the same title. The central issues are the adjustments, reforms, and innovations occasioned by "". .

Attention was also paid to the speed and efficiency of soldiers:
But the young recruits in particular must be exercised in running, in order to charge the enemy with great vigor; occupy, on occasion, an advantageous post with greater expedition, and prevent the enemy in their designs upon the same; that they may, when sent to reconnoiter, advance with speed, return with greater celerity and more easily come up with the enemy in a pursuit. – Vegetius, De Re Militari
After practicing strength and character, there was a time to learn formation (empty square, wedge or testudo ) and signaling. Finally, newly recruited soldiers were taught to use weapons. Exercises, however, were carried out using wooden and wicker swords or shields that were heavier than a real weapon. In this way, the legionary was acquainted with the fatigue and exhaustion that could appear on the battlefield. IV. Length of service and pay
Emperor Octavian August finally determined the length of the legionary’s service in 16 BCE as 16 years. After this period, it was expected that the hardened soldier would join the vexillum veteranorum or veteran unit for four consecutive years. In 6 CE the service was extended to 20 years and the so-called praemia militare, which is a form of retirement pension paid to veterans in the amount of 12,000 sesterces (3,000 denarii). Over time, veterans received land instead of money. In the middle of the first century CE the service was finally 25 years old. However, all military reports were less and less followed, and some legionaries could boast of 30 or even 40 years of military service. In addition to payment (after serving more years), praemia militare legionaries received a pay of 900 sesteria per year (paid in three tranches). Wages remained constant until around 80 CE, despite rising inflation. Naturally, however, the pay varied depending on the rank – specialists, e.g., received 1.5, 2 or 2 times more pay. V. Temptation of loot and plunder
What often encouraged young people to join the army was the prospect of gaining great spoils during the war campaigns. Leaders wanting to gain the support of their soldiers allowed for plunder and robbery in the captured cities. There were rules regarding plundering in the Roman army. When the city was stormed, all the spoils were divided among legionaries. If the city surrendered itself, the senior officers decided about the distribution of loot. The fact that the allocation of loot was an important element for the integrity of the Roman army is testified by the account of Livius, who mentioned the rebellion of the army stationed under Sukron (in Spain) in 206 BCE According to an ancient historian, the decline in soldier’s discipline took place there, among others, “because they were used to living from quite abundant spoils gained on the enemy” . In the case of conquering a hostile city, the Romans quite often carried out not only his plunder, but also murders of the population inhabiting them. The acts of crime on the civilian population of the captured city were carried out in two ways: by order of the main commander or on his own responsibility. In Roman war doctrine, however, it was not accepted that Roman people, especially women and their virtue, would suffer. During the civil war in Spain, Roman commander Sertorius (1st century BCE) ordered the loss of the entire 500 people cohort. He did it because one of the soldiers of this unit tried to rape a Roman citizen. In addition to discipline and training, brotherhood had a great impact on the quality of the Roman army. Roman Centuria with 80 people, was divided into 10 contubernium, of 8 soldiers. They shared a tent, spent their free days, marched, practiced and fought. They were brothers in arms and often undertook to contact the family of a fallen companion. VII. Cowardice was severly punished
The word decimation nowadays usually means destruction of the environment, population or ecosystem. In Roman times, the term was used to describe the punishment that Roman generals used on their disobedient troops to discipline them properly.

In addition, the shortage of available manpower led to a greater burden being placed upon Rome's allies for the provision of allied troops. Eventually, the Romans were forced to begin hiring mercenaries to fight alongside the legions. The legion after the reforms of Gaius Marius (107–27 BC)
In a process known as the Marian reforms, Roman consul Gaius Marius carried out a programme of reform of the Roman military. In 107 BC, all citizens, regardless of their wealth or social class, were made eligible for entry into the Roman army. This move formalised and concluded a gradual process that had been growing for centuries, of removing property requirements for military service. The distinction between the three heavy infantry classes, which had already become blurred, had collapsed into a single class of heavy legionary infantry. The heavy infantry legionaries were drawn from citizen stock, while non-citizens came to dominate the ranks of the light infantry. The army's higher-level officers and commanders were still drawn exclusively from the Roman aristocracy. Unlike earlier in the Republic, legionaries were no longer fighting on a seasonal basis to protect their land. Instead, they received standard pay, and were employed by the state on a fixed-term basis. As a consequence, military duty began to appeal most to the poorest sections of society, to whom a salaried pay was attractive. A destabilising consequence of this development was that the proletariat ""acquired a stronger and more elevated position"" within the state. The legions of the late Republic were, structurally, almost entirely heavy infantry. The legion's main sub-unit was called a cohort and consisted of approximately 480 infantrymen. The cohort was therefore a much larger unit than the earlier maniple sub-unit, and was divided into six centuries of 80 men each. Each century was separated further into 10 ""tent groups"" of 8 men each. Legions additionally consisted of a small body, typically 120 men, of Roman legionary cavalry. The cavalry troops were used as scouts and dispatch riders rather than battlefield cavalry. Legions also contained a dedicated group of artillery crew of perhaps 60 men. Each legion was normally partnered with an approximately equal number of allied (non-Roman) troops. However, the most obvious deficiency of the Roman army remained its shortage of cavalry, especially heavy cavalry. As Rome's borders expanded and its adversaries changed from largely infantry-based to largely cavalry-based troops, the infantry-based Roman army began to find itself at a tactical disadvantage, particularly in the East. After having declined in size following the subjugation of the Mediterranean, the Roman navy underwent short-term upgrading and revitalisation in the late Republic to meet several new demands. Under Caesar, an invasion fleet was assembled in the English Channel to allow the invasion of Britannia; under Pompey, a large fleet was raised in the Mediterranean Sea to clear the sea of Cilician pirates. During the civil war that followed, as many as a thousand ships were either constructed or pressed into service from Greek cities. The core of the campaign history of the Roman Republican military is the account of the Roman military's land battles. Despite the encompassing of lands around the periphery of the Mediterranean sea, naval battles were typically less significant than land battles to the military history of Rome. As with most ancient civilisations, Rome's military served the triple purposes of securing its borders, exploiting peripheral areas through measures such as imposing tribute on conquered peoples, and maintaining internal order. From the outset, Rome's military typified this pattern and the majority of Rome's campaigns were characterised by one of two types. The first is the territorial expansionist campaign, normally begun as a counter-offensive, in which each victory brought subjugation of large areas of territory. The second is the civil war, of which examples plagued the Roman Republic in its final century. Roman armies were not invincible, despite their formidable reputation and host of victories. Over the centuries the Romans ""produced their share of incompetents"" who led Roman armies into catastrophic defeats.

In fact, the legions of early Rome were conscripted only as part-time soldiers and had their main occupation as farmers and herders. This stringent economic system prevented them from taking part in extended campaigns (that hardly went beyond a month), thus keeping military actions short and decisive. Moreover, these legions had to pay for their own arms and armaments – which at times was compensated only by a small payment from the state. The Ancient Roman Infantry, circa late 6th century BC – early 4th century BC
The popular notion of the Roman army fighting in maniples is a correct one if only perceived during the later years after 4th century BC. However, in the preceding centuries, the Roman military system was inspired by its more-advanced neighbor (and enemy) – the Etruscans. In fact, the hoplite tactics of mass formation of men fighting with their shield and spear were already adopted by the Greeks by 675 BC and reached the Italy-based Etruscans by early 7th century BC. The Romans, in turn, were influenced by their Etruscan foes, and thus managed to adopt many of the rigid Greek-inspired formations along with their arms. As per historical tradition, the very adoption of the hoplite tactics was fueled by the sweeping military reforms undertaken by the penultimate Roman ruler Servius Tullius, who probably reigned in 6th century BC. He made a departure from the ‘tribal’ institutions of curia and gentes, and instead divided the military based on the individual soldier’s possession of the property. In that regard, the Roman army and its mirroring peace-time society were segregated into classes (classis). According to Livy, there were six such classes – all based on their possession of wealth (that was defined by asses or small copper coins). The first three classes fought as the traditional hoplites, armed with spears and shields – with the armaments possibly matching their economic statuses. The fourth class was only armed with spears and javelins, while the fifth class was scantily armed with slings. Finally, the six (and poorest) class was totally exempt from military service. This system once again alludes to how the early Roman army was formed on truly nationalistic values. Simply put, these men left their homes and went to war to protect (or increase) their own lands and wealth, as opposed to opting for just a ‘career’. The Ancient Roman Infantry, circa late 4th century BC –
The greatest strength of the Roman army had always been its adaptability and penchant for evolution. Like we mentioned before how the early Romans from their kingdom era adopted the hoplite tactics of their foes and defeated them in turn. However, by the time of the first Samnite War (in around 343 BC), the Roman army seemed to have endorsed newer formations that were more flexible in nature. This change in battlefield stratagem was probably in response to the Samnite armies – and as a result, the maniple formations came into existence (instead of the earlier rigid phalanx). The very term manipulus means ‘a handful’, and thus its early standard pertained to a pole with a handful of hay placed around it. According to most literary pieces of evidence, the Roman army was now divided up into three separate battle-lines, with the first line comprising the young hastati in ten maniples (each of 120 men); the second line comprising the hardened principes in ten maniples; and the third and last line consisting of the veteran triarii in ten maniples – who probably fought as heavy hoplites (but their maniples had only 60 men). Additionally, these battle-lines were also possibly screened by the light-armed velites, who mostly belonged to the poorer class of Roman civilians. Now if we go back to Livy’s description of the classis, we can certainly draw similarities between the economic classes and their corresponding statuses within the manipular system. For example, the primary three classes were now divided into the main fighting arm – and they comprised the hastati (the young and relatively poor); the principes (the experienced and belonging to the middle class); and the triarii (the veterans and relatively well-off citizens).

Le Bohec calls for more detailed studies on the ranks of the army (Chapter 6, pp. 95-117). At the higher levels of responsibilty one can trace the military careers (p. 102 for a summary chart). St. Jerome’s use of military terminology assists in the reconstruction of lesser ranks (tables on pp. 103, 105) and Le Bohec finds continuities with terminology from Republican times. Military service itself was characterized by the increased performance of policing activities. Military building activity (Chapter 7, pp. 118-130) is a field in motion for Le Bohec, one marked by new excavations and new assessments of the already known data (site list on pp. 129-130). He cautions that one must abandon ideas of a ‘tetrarchische’ camp plan and notes that individual fortifications themselves seem to decrease in square area (Abb. 48 and p. 125). The next two chapters (Chapter 8, pp. 131-151; Chapter 9, pp. 152-170) discuss various aspects of the army’s tactics. Le Bohec removes the erroneous perception of the ‘soldier-farmer’ constantly tending crops (pp. 141 ff); supplies were made available by the state and private contractors with only limited interruptions in success (p. 146). Soldiers relied increasingly on artillery (missilia, tela), in addition to their swords and lances, although it proves difficult to match found objects with the terminology in literary sources (p. 134). Military diplomacy requires a more detailed study, but an increased interest on the part of the emperor in receiving all information-gathering reports is noted. As regards actual battle, the literary sources reflect that for most Romans military matters were an unknown quantity. No detailed portrait of a specific enemy normally was presented by ancient authors and Le Bohec argues against the selective rehabilitation of individual peoples, a practice known only this century and the end of the last (pp. 157-158). Overall, the army displayed a flexibility in battle tactics, which were adapted to deal with the enemy at hand and placed importance upon Pioneerarbeit. Chapters 10 (pp. 171-184), 11 (pp. 185-22), and 12 (pp. 201-212) discuss the various aspects of strategy. Le Bohec begins by dispelling misconceptions (pp. 171-173). By investigating the ancients’ use of strategic terminology (pp. 174-177) one discovers many continuities with earlier Roman practices, particularly those of the early empire. Le Bohec sets aside the view of a ‘bewegliche Armee”. Often it is difficult to distinguish between pure fortifications, cities in which soldiers were stationed, and cities proper (p. 181). The viae militares were not military in nature. Rather the term denotes a road of greater breadth (pp.183-184). The different theaters of action are surveyed in Chapters 11 and 12, with cautious reporting about the state of our knowledge and recent scholarship. Contact between military and civilians is the topic for Chapter 13 (pp. 218-228), the soldier’s life seen as ‘ein verzerrtes Bild der Zivilgesellschaft”, a somewhat altered model drawn from the structure of civil society (p. 213). Without soldiers the Empire would have proved ungovernable, hence the importance placed on the Emperor’s verbal communications and appearances before the troops, the adlocutio, and the more ornate adventus. Some gatherings are illustrated, but pose difficulties in interpretation (p. 215 and Abb. 16). Setting aside the illusory ‘soldier-farmer’, Le Bohec discusses the various forms of payment to the military and their economic impact (p. 223 for flow chart). The Roman army, like society, gradually Christianized, the first Christians present in the force as early as 200 AD. Chapters 14 (pp. 229-242) and 15 (pp. 243-260) return to a chronological narrative. The years 364-378 represent a worsening of the military situation, but Le Bohec cautions that the Voelkerwanderung was a slower process than often perceived.

For a five-hundred-year period beginning in 100 b.c. With Marius’s and Sulla’s defeat of the massive tribal invasions of the Mediterranean world by the Teutons and the Cimbri, the Romans ruled the northern frontier of their world, an empire that stretched across europe from the mouth of the Rhine to that of the Danube. On the other side of the Rhine lay fierce warrior tribes, which from time to time posed serious threats to the empire’s security. Yet for all their fierceness, the tribes were consistently defeated by Rome’s legions. There were military defeats, of course, such as the massacre of Teutoburger Wald, but from the crushing of the Teutons and the Cimbri, the Romans enjoyed an astonishing record of destroying the armed mobs that characterized the German approach to war. From the rise of Octavian Caesar, later titled Augustus, to supremacy over the Roman world in 32 B.C. with his defeat of Mark Antony, a professional army of between twenty-five and thirty-three legions (approximately 150,000 legionnaires and 150,000 auxiliaries) defended the empire from Hadrian’s Wall in northern Britain to the upper Nile and from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Euphrates River in Syria. This indeed was an extraordinary example of economy of force. What explains this stunning military effectiveness? Above all, Roman military effectiveness depended on the discipline and training of the legionnaires, the hallmark of a professional military organization in the modern sense. Flavius Josephus, the great historian of the Roman-Jewish War of A.D. 66–70, described the Roman training regimen in the following terms:
And indeed, if anyone does but attend to the other parts of [Roman] military discipline, he will be forced to confess, that their obtaining so large a dominion hath been the acquisition of their valor, and not the bare gift of fortune: for they do not begin to use their weapons first in time of war, nor do they put their hands first into motion, having been idle in times of peace; but as if their weapons were part of themselves, they never have any truce with warlike exercises; nor do they stay till times of war admonish them to use them; for their military exercises by no means fall short of the tension of real warfare, but every soldier is every day exercised, and that with real diligence, as if they were in time of war, which is why they bear the fatigue of battle so easily; … nor would he be mistaken [who] would call their exercises unbloody battles, and their battles bloody exercises. In short, the Roman army with its legions and auxiliaries was the first true professional army in history, one that relied in battle on its discipline and training rather than on the psychological glue of culture and familial and social relations. In other words, it trained as it fought. The resulting superiority allowed the Romans to dominate their world for two and a half centuries. But things fell apart in the first half of the third century. Unfortunately for historians, there are few written records for this crucial period. Between 31 B.C. and A.D. 211, excluding emperors killed in the two major civil wars, ten emperors died of natural causes and only three were assassinated by their officers or soldiers. However, in the forty-year period between A.D. 235 and 275, only one emperor died of natural causes, while no fewer than ten were assassinated by their officers or killed by barbarians, the majority via the former mode. In effect, the armies and ambitious generals tore the empire apart, while great barbarian invasions ravaged much of its territory. The problem was that of legitimacy in the transition from one emperor to the next. The great Roman historian Tacitus had suggested that the root cause of the civil war of A.D. 69–70, the year of the four emperors, was that the legions had discovered the secret of empire—namely, that they could choose the emperor.

The Brooklyn Museum’s “Killer Heels: The Art of the High-Heeled Shoe” exhibition explores the origins of high heels worn by women and men across the world since ancient times. Meanwhile, a book that was recently published under the title “Killer Heels” follows the story of high-heeled shoes through various essays and illustrations throughout history, from ancient Greece until modern times. In ancient Greece, platform sandals called “kothorni” were shoes with high wooden cork soles, worn by actors in order to differentiate the social classes and importance of each character during the play. Later, in ancient Rome, high heels were used to identify prostitutes to potential clients, therefore, high heels became associated with prostitution. In the Middle East around 1300 BC, people would wear high heels made from wood in the bath so that they would not slip on the wet floor. These wooden platform shoes were called Kabkabs, due to the sound they made when they hit the floor. During the Middle Ages, both men and women wore “pattens,” wooden soles attached to their shoes in order to keep their fragile and expensive footwear away from street mud. “Chopines,” another form of platform shoes, became popular in Turkey and throughout Europe around the 1400s until the mid-1600s. The shoes were often higher than 30 inches and women who wore them usually used canes or servants to assist them in walking.","[{'passage': 'gymnasiums, and many taverns, baths and brothels. Throughout the territory under Rome\'s control, residential architecture ranged from very modest houses to country villas, and in the capital city of Rome, to the residences on the elegant Palatine Hill, from which the word ""palace"" is derived. The vast majority of the population lived in the city center, packed into apartment blocks. Most Roman towns and cities had a forum and temples, as did the city of Rome itself. Aqueducts were built to bring water to urban centers and wine and cooking oil were imported from abroad. Landlords generally resided in cities and their estates were left in the care of farm managers. To stimulate a higher labour productivity, many landlords freed large numbers of slaves. Beginning in the middle of the 2nd century BC, Greek culture was increasingly ascendant, in spite of tirades against the ""softening"" effects of Hellenised culture. By the time of Augustus, cultured Greek household slaves taught the Roman young (sometimes even the girls). Greek sculptures adorned Hellenistic landscape gardening on the Palatine or in the villas, and much Roman cuisine was essentially Greek. Roman writers disdained Latin for a cultured Greek style. Social history and structure\nMany aspects of Roman culture were borrowed from the Greeks. In architecture and sculpture, the difference between Greek models and Roman paintings are apparent. The chief Roman contributions to architecture were the arch and the dome. Rome has also had a tremendous impact on European cultures following it. Its significance is perhaps best reflected in its endurance and influence, as is seen in the longevity and lasting importance of works of Virgil and Ovid. Latin, the Republic\'s primary language, remains used for liturgical purposes by the Roman Catholic Church, and up to the 19th century was used extensively in scholarly writings in, for example, science and mathematics. Roman law laid the foundations for the laws of many European countries and their colonies. The center of the early social structure was the family, which was not only marked by blood relations but also by the legally constructed relation of patria potestas. The Pater familias was the absolute head of the family; he was the master over his wife, his children, the wives of his sons, the nephews, the slaves and the freedmen, disposing of them and of their goods at will, even putting them to death. Roman law recognised only patrician families as legal entities. Slavery and slaves were part of the social order; there were slave markets where they could be bought and sold. Many slaves were freed by the masters for services rendered; some slaves could save money to buy their freedom. Generally, mutilation and murder of slaves was prohibited by legislation. It is estimated that over 25% of the Roman population was enslaved. Clothing and dining\nMen typically wore a toga, and women a stola. The woman\'s stola looked different than a toga, and was usually brightly coloured. The cloth and the dress distinguished one class of people from the other class. The tunic worn by plebeians, or common people, like shepherds and slaves, was made from coarse and dark material, whereas the tunic worn by patricians was of linen or white wool. A knight or magistrate would wear an augusticlavus, a tunic bearing small purple studs. Senators wore tunics with broad red stripes, called tunica laticlavia. Military tunics were shorter than the ones worn by civilians. Boys, up until the festival of Liberalia, wore the toga praetexta, which was a toga with a crimson or purple border. The toga virilis, (or toga pura) was worn by men over the age of 16 to signify their citizenship in Rome. The toga picta was worn by triumphant generals and had embroidery of their skill on the battlefield. The toga pulla was worn when in mourning. Even footwear indicated a person\'s social status. Patricians wore red and orange sandals, senators had brown footwear, consuls had white shoes, and soldiers wore heavy boots. The Romans also invented socks for those soldiers required to fight on the northern frontiers, sometimes worn in sandals. Romans had simple food habits.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:dd83c13a-60ed-4da4-94a6-5d461eaafec6>']}, {'passage': 'In a discussion of any ancient music, however, non-specialists and even many musicians have to be reminded that much of what makes our modern music familiar to us is the result of developments only within the last 1,000 years; thus, our ideas of melody, scales, harmony, and even the instruments we use would not be familiar to Romans who made and listened to music many centuries earlier. Over time, Roman architecture was modified as their urban requirements changed, and the civil engineering and building construction technology became developed and refined. The Roman concrete has remained a riddle, and even after more than 2,000 years some Roman structures still stand magnificently. The architectural style of the capitol city was emulated by other urban centers under Roman control and influence. Roman cities were well planned, efficiently managed and neatly maintained. Sports and entertainment\nThe city of Rome had a place called the Campus Martius (""Field of Mars""), which was a sort of drill ground for Roman soldiers. Later, the Campus became Rome\'s track and field playground. In the campus, the youth assembled to play and exercise, which included jumping, wrestling, boxing and racing. Equestrian sports, throwing, and swimming were also preferred physical activities. In the countryside, pastime included fishing and hunting. Board games played in Rome included dice (Tesserae or Tali), Roman Chess (Latrunculi), Roman Checkers (Calculi), Tic-tac-toe (Terni Lapilli), and Ludus duodecim scriptorum and Tabula, predecessors of backgammon. There were several other activities to keep people engaged like chariot races, musical and theatrical performances. Roman religious beliefs date back to the founding of Rome, around 800 BC. However, the Roman religion commonly associated with the republic and early empire did not begin until around 500 BC, when Romans came in contact with Greek culture, and adopted many of the Greek religious beliefs. Private and personal worship was an important aspect of religious practices. In a sense, each household was a temple to the gods. Each household had an altar (lararium), at which the family members would offer prayers, perform rites, and interact with the household gods. Many of the gods that Romans worshiped came from the Proto-Indo-European pantheon, others were based on Greek gods. The two most famous deities were Jupiter (the king God) and Mars (the god of war). With its cultural influence spreading over most of the Mediterranean, Romans began accepting foreign gods into their own culture, as well as other philosophical traditions such as Cynicism and Stoicism.

The Roman military was split into the Roman army and the Roman navy, although these two branches were less distinct than they tend to be in modern defence forces. Within the top-level branches of army and navy, structural changes occurred both as a result of positive military reform and through organic structural evolution. Hoplite armies (509–c. 315 BC)\nDuring this period, Roman soldiers seem to have been modelled after those of the Etruscans to the north, who themselves seem to have copied their style of warfare from the Greeks. Traditionally, the introduction of the phalanx formation into the Roman army is ascribed to the city\'s penultimate king, Servius Tullius (ruled 578 to 534 BC). According to Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the front rank was composed of the wealthiest citizens, who were able to purchase the best equipment. Each subsequent rank consisted of those with less wealth and poorer equipment than the one before it.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:dd83c13a-60ed-4da4-94a6-5d461eaafec6>']}, {'passage': 'The chapter concludes with a brief but interesting review of recruitment, training and promotion--with an almost exclusively imperial focus. The fourth chapter, ""The Culture of the Roman Army,"" continues the handbook style/format. Following a brief section on ""physiognomy,"" by which Southern seems to mean the provenance of the recruits, we read of matters of morale, discipline, and traditions. Southern notes the privileged legal status of soldiers but notes as well that military discipline was apparently enforced with less rigor in the Empire than in the Republic and also less so in peacetime than in war. Punishments ranged from extra duty to loss of rank or pay to discharge and finally execution. Southern notes as well that soldiers were not entitled to leave or furlough but could apparently arrange privately with their commanders to be absent (literally at their own expense) from camp and the duty roster. The section on traditions explores unit names, decorations and medals, uniforms (from helmets to socks over several pages), military music, and holidays. The last include the specially ""military festivals"" of the Quinquatria on 19 March and the feast of Vesta on 9 June as well as the emperor\'s birthday and 21 April, the anniversary of the founding of the city. A section on veterans concludes the chapter; Southern explains the military diploma, the privileges and obligations, the state funded, one time, cash pensions of the retirees, and finally the exemptions from some taxes. Chapter five examines the subject of ""The Roman Army at War."" Southern opens with the traditional claim that ""From their earliest beginnings to the late empire, the Romans consistently adopted a warlike disposition""(171). That said, however, she believes that the Empire lacked a strategic plan: Romans tended to behave reactively in going to war and pragmatically in settling a conflict. Reflecting the defensive posture employed over much of imperial history, Southern devotes several pages (178-186) to frontiers and forts (with perhaps the book\'s most useful illustrations--diagrams of the Wallsend and Housestead forts on Hadrian\'s Wall). Under tactics and operational concepts are grouped the order of march (with examples taken from Polybius, Josephus and Arrian), marching and temporary camps, and battle. The chapter examines as well planning and staff work, command and control (including the difficult balance of aggression and diffidence that troubled imperial commanders like Corbulo and Agricola), and operations involving combined naval and ground forces. Rather unusually for this book but doubtlessly reflecting the sources, almost all of the information about the last dates from the Republic rather than the Empire. ""The Tools of War"" occupy chapter six, though in addition to weaponry Southern examines logistics, communications, medicine, technology and cartography. The weapons discussed include gladius, pilum, lancea, spatha, pugio, bows and arrows, artillery, and slingshots. Here more than anywhere else a selection of drawings or photographs would have been immensely helpful. While Southern does provide references to other authors, I would have traded several of the book\'s illustrations taken from the Library of Congress for genuine ""hardware"" here. In discussing logistics Southern points to the obvious differences between Republic and Empire when permanent forts and bases were the rule. Over several pages Southern discusses food and fodder requirements, the number of pack animals employed by a legion on the move, and the speed of transport/march. Of intelligence and communications Southern suggests that they worked much better on the local than the regional or imperial level; and so, as the frontiers became increasingly troublesome, emperors necessarily moved from Rome to where their presence was required. The discussion of medicine is brief, though Southern does demonstrate that the Romans made significant advances in the treatment of wounds and outbreaks of disease/illness in camp. Equally brief are the sections on technology and cartography, the former effectively equated with engineering and the latter with itineraries; again references indicate possibilities for more detailed study. Chapter seven, ""The Late Roman Army,"" returns to more traditional, historical narrative in the book\'s shortest chapter; here Southern provides a dramatically abridged but updated version of her 1996 work of the same title.

Finally, newly recruited soldiers were taught to use weapons. Exercises, however, were carried out using wooden and wicker swords or shields that were heavier than a real weapon. In this way, the legionary was acquainted with the fatigue and exhaustion that could appear on the battlefield. IV. Length of service and pay\nEmperor Octavian August finally determined the length of the legionary’s service in 16 BCE as 16 years. After this period, it was expected that the hardened soldier would join the vexillum veteranorum or veteran unit for four consecutive years. In 6 CE the service was extended to 20 years and the so-called praemia militare, which is a form of retirement pension paid to veterans in the amount of 12,000 sesterces (3,000 denarii). Over time, veterans received land instead of money. In the middle of the first century CE the service was finally 25 years old. However, all military reports were less and less followed, and some legionaries could boast of 30 or even 40 years of military service. In addition to payment (after serving more years), praemia militare legionaries received a pay of 900 sesteria per year (paid in three tranches). Wages remained constant until around 80 CE, despite rising inflation. Naturally, however, the pay varied depending on the rank – specialists, e.g., received 1.5, 2 or 2 times more pay. V. Temptation of loot and plunder\nWhat often encouraged young people to join the army was the prospect of gaining great spoils during the war campaigns. Leaders wanting to gain the support of their soldiers allowed for plunder and robbery in the captured cities. There were rules regarding plundering in the Roman army. When the city was stormed, all the spoils were divided among legionaries. If the city surrendered itself, the senior officers decided about the distribution of loot. The fact that the allocation of loot was an important element for the integrity of the Roman army is testified by the account of Livius, who mentioned the rebellion of the army stationed under Sukron (in Spain) in 206 BCE According to an ancient historian, the decline in soldier’s discipline took place there, among others, “because they were used to living from quite abundant spoils gained on the enemy” . In the case of conquering a hostile city, the Romans quite often carried out not only his plunder, but also murders of the population inhabiting them. The acts of crime on the civilian population of the captured city were carried out in two ways: by order of the main commander or on his own responsibility. In Roman war doctrine, however, it was not accepted that Roman people, especially women and their virtue, would suffer. During the civil war in Spain, Roman commander Sertorius (1st century BCE) ordered the loss of the entire 500 people cohort. He did it because one of the soldiers of this unit tried to rape a Roman citizen. In addition to discipline and training, brotherhood had a great impact on the quality of the Roman army. Roman Centuria with 80 people, was divided into 10 contubernium, of 8 soldiers. They shared a tent, spent their free days, marched, practiced and fought. They were brothers in arms and often undertook to contact the family of a fallen companion. VII. Cowardice was severly punished\nThe word decimation nowadays usually means destruction of the environment, population or ecosystem. In Roman times, the term was used to describe the punishment that Roman generals used on their disobedient troops to discipline them properly.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:a35aeac9-f54b-48e4-94a9-c499f1fc5903>']}, {'passage': 'In addition, the shortage of available manpower led to a greater burden being placed upon Rome\'s allies for the provision of allied troops. Eventually, the Romans were forced to begin hiring mercenaries to fight alongside the legions. The legion after the reforms of Gaius Marius (107–27 BC)\nIn a process known as the Marian reforms, Roman consul Gaius Marius carried out a programme of reform of the Roman military. In 107 BC, all citizens, regardless of their wealth or social class, were made eligible for entry into the Roman army. This move formalised and concluded a gradual process that had been growing for centuries, of removing property requirements for military service. The distinction between the three heavy infantry classes, which had already become blurred, had collapsed into a single class of heavy legionary infantry. The heavy infantry legionaries were drawn from citizen stock, while non-citizens came to dominate the ranks of the light infantry. The army\'s higher-level officers and commanders were still drawn exclusively from the Roman aristocracy. Unlike earlier in the Republic, legionaries were no longer fighting on a seasonal basis to protect their land. Instead, they received standard pay, and were employed by the state on a fixed-term basis. As a consequence, military duty began to appeal most to the poorest sections of society, to whom a salaried pay was attractive. A destabilising consequence of this development was that the proletariat ""acquired a stronger and more elevated position"" within the state. The legions of the late Republic were, structurally, almost entirely heavy infantry. The legion\'s main sub-unit was called a cohort and consisted of approximately 480 infantrymen. The cohort was therefore a much larger unit than the earlier maniple sub-unit, and was divided into six centuries of 80 men each. Each century was separated further into 10 ""tent groups"" of 8 men each. Legions additionally consisted of a small body, typically 120 men, of Roman legionary cavalry. The cavalry troops were used as scouts and dispatch riders rather than battlefield cavalry. Legions also contained a dedicated group of artillery crew of perhaps 60 men. Each legion was normally partnered with an approximately equal number of allied (non-Roman) troops. However, the most obvious deficiency of the Roman army remained its shortage of cavalry, especially heavy cavalry. As Rome\'s borders expanded and its adversaries changed from largely infantry-based to largely cavalry-based troops, the infantry-based Roman army began to find itself at a tactical disadvantage, particularly in the East. After having declined in size following the subjugation of the Mediterranean, the Roman navy underwent short-term upgrading and revitalisation in the late Republic to meet several new demands. Under Caesar, an invasion fleet was assembled in the English Channel to allow the invasion of Britannia; under Pompey, a large fleet was raised in the Mediterranean Sea to clear the sea of Cilician pirates. During the civil war that followed, as many as a thousand ships were either constructed or pressed into service from Greek cities. The core of the campaign history of the Roman Republican military is the account of the Roman military\'s land battles. Despite the encompassing of lands around the periphery of the Mediterranean sea, naval battles were typically less significant than land battles to the military history of Rome. As with most ancient civilisations, Rome\'s military served the triple purposes of securing its borders, exploiting peripheral areas through measures such as imposing tribute on conquered peoples, and maintaining internal order. From the outset, Rome\'s military typified this pattern and the majority of Rome\'s campaigns were characterised by one of two types. The first is the territorial expansionist campaign, normally begun as a counter-offensive, in which each victory brought subjugation of large areas of territory. The second is the civil war, of which examples plagued the Roman Republic in its final century. Roman armies were not invincible, despite their formidable reputation and host of victories. Over the centuries the Romans ""produced their share of incompetents"" who led Roman armies into catastrophic defeats.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:dd83c13a-60ed-4da4-94a6-5d461eaafec6>']}, {'passage': 'In fact, the legions of early Rome were conscripted only as part-time soldiers and had their main occupation as farmers and herders. This stringent economic system prevented them from taking part in extended campaigns (that hardly went beyond a month), thus keeping military actions short and decisive. Moreover, these legions had to pay for their own arms and armaments – which at times was compensated only by a small payment from the state. The Ancient Roman Infantry, circa late 6th century BC – early 4th century BC\nThe popular notion of the Roman army fighting in maniples is a correct one if only perceived during the later years after 4th century BC. However, in the preceding centuries, the Roman military system was inspired by its more-advanced neighbor (and enemy) – the Etruscans. In fact, the hoplite tactics of mass formation of men fighting with their shield and spear were already adopted by the Greeks by 675 BC and reached the Italy-based Etruscans by early 7th century BC. The Romans, in turn, were influenced by their Etruscan foes, and thus managed to adopt many of the rigid Greek-inspired formations along with their arms. As per historical tradition, the very adoption of the hoplite tactics was fueled by the sweeping military reforms undertaken by the penultimate Roman ruler Servius Tullius, who probably reigned in 6th century BC. He made a departure from the ‘tribal’ institutions of curia and gentes, and instead divided the military based on the individual soldier’s possession of the property. In that regard, the Roman army and its mirroring peace-time society were segregated into classes (classis). According to Livy, there were six such classes – all based on their possession of wealth (that was defined by asses or small copper coins). The first three classes fought as the traditional hoplites, armed with spears and shields – with the armaments possibly matching their economic statuses. The fourth class was only armed with spears and javelins, while the fifth class was scantily armed with slings. Finally, the six (and poorest) class was totally exempt from military service. This system once again alludes to how the early Roman army was formed on truly nationalistic values. Simply put, these men left their homes and went to war to protect (or increase) their own lands and wealth, as opposed to opting for just a ‘career’. The Ancient Roman Infantry, circa late 4th century BC –\nThe greatest strength of the Roman army had always been its adaptability and penchant for evolution. Like we mentioned before how the early Romans from their kingdom era adopted the hoplite tactics of their foes and defeated them in turn. However, by the time of the first Samnite War (in around 343 BC), the Roman army seemed to have endorsed newer formations that were more flexible in nature. This change in battlefield stratagem was probably in response to the Samnite armies – and as a result, the maniple formations came into existence (instead of the earlier rigid phalanx). The very term manipulus means ‘a handful’, and thus its early standard pertained to a pole with a handful of hay placed around it. According to most literary pieces of evidence, the Roman army was now divided up into three separate battle-lines, with the first line comprising the young hastati in ten maniples (each of 120 men); the second line comprising the hardened principes in ten maniples; and the third and last line consisting of the veteran triarii in ten maniples – who probably fought as heavy hoplites (but their maniples had only 60 men). Additionally, these battle-lines were also possibly screened by the light-armed velites, who mostly belonged to the poorer class of Roman civilians. Now if we go back to Livy’s description of the classis, we can certainly draw similarities between the economic classes and their corresponding statuses within the manipular system. For example, the primary three classes were now divided into the main fighting arm – and they comprised the hastati (the young and relatively poor); the principes (the experienced and belonging to the middle class); and the triarii (the veterans and relatively well-off citizens).', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:7b1790ca-1d0b-4b0a-8676-7afcb6d5e50b>']}, {'passage': 'Le Bohec calls for more detailed studies on the ranks of the army (Chapter 6, pp. 95-117). At the higher levels of responsibilty one can trace the military careers (p. 102 for a summary chart). St. Jerome’s use of military terminology assists in the reconstruction of lesser ranks (tables on pp. 103, 105) and Le Bohec finds continuities with terminology from Republican times. Military service itself was characterized by the increased performance of policing activities. Military building activity (Chapter 7, pp. 118-130) is a field in motion for Le Bohec, one marked by new excavations and new assessments of the already known data (site list on pp. 129-130). He cautions that one must abandon ideas of a ‘tetrarchische’ camp plan and notes that individual fortifications themselves seem to decrease in square area (Abb. 48 and p. 125). The next two chapters (Chapter 8, pp. 131-151; Chapter 9, pp. 152-170) discuss various aspects of the army’s tactics. Le Bohec removes the erroneous perception of the ‘soldier-farmer’ constantly tending crops (pp. 141 ff); supplies were made available by the state and private contractors with only limited interruptions in success (p. 146). Soldiers relied increasingly on artillery (missilia, tela), in addition to their swords and lances, although it proves difficult to match found objects with the terminology in literary sources (p. 134). Military diplomacy requires a more detailed study, but an increased interest on the part of the emperor in receiving all information-gathering reports is noted. As regards actual battle, the literary sources reflect that for most Romans military matters were an unknown quantity. No detailed portrait of a specific enemy normally was presented by ancient authors and Le Bohec argues against the selective rehabilitation of individual peoples, a practice known only this century and the end of the last (pp. 157-158). Overall, the army displayed a flexibility in battle tactics, which were adapted to deal with the enemy at hand and placed importance upon Pioneerarbeit. Chapters 10 (pp. 171-184), 11 (pp. 185-22), and 12 (pp. 201-212) discuss the various aspects of strategy. Le Bohec begins by dispelling misconceptions (pp. 171-173). By investigating the ancients’ use of strategic terminology (pp. 174-177) one discovers many continuities with earlier Roman practices, particularly those of the early empire. Le Bohec sets aside the view of a ‘bewegliche Armee”. Often it is difficult to distinguish between pure fortifications, cities in which soldiers were stationed, and cities proper (p. 181). The viae militares were not military in nature. Rather the term denotes a road of greater breadth (pp.183-184). The different theaters of action are surveyed in Chapters 11 and 12, with cautious reporting about the state of our knowledge and recent scholarship. Contact between military and civilians is the topic for Chapter 13 (pp. 218-228), the soldier’s life seen as ‘ein verzerrtes Bild der Zivilgesellschaft”, a somewhat altered model drawn from the structure of civil society (p. 213). Without soldiers the Empire would have proved ungovernable, hence the importance placed on the Emperor’s verbal communications and appearances before the troops, the adlocutio, and the more ornate adventus. Some gatherings are illustrated, but pose difficulties in interpretation (p. 215 and Abb. 16). Setting aside the illusory ‘soldier-farmer’, Le Bohec discusses the various forms of payment to the military and their economic impact (p. 223 for flow chart). The Roman army, like society, gradually Christianized, the first Christians present in the force as early as 200 AD. Chapters 14 (pp. 229-242) and 15 (pp. 243-260) return to a chronological narrative. The years 364-378 represent a worsening of the military situation, but Le Bohec cautions that the Voelkerwanderung was a slower process than often perceived.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:32818d17-4e19-4047-b97f-5ade37102a85>']}, {'passage': 'For a five-hundred-year period beginning in 100 b.c. With Marius’s and Sulla’s defeat of the massive tribal invasions of the Mediterranean world by the Teutons and the Cimbri, the Romans ruled the northern frontier of their world, an empire that stretched across europe from the mouth of the Rhine to that of the Danube. On the other side of the Rhine lay fierce warrior tribes, which from time to time posed serious threats to the empire’s security. Yet for all their fierceness, the tribes were consistently defeated by Rome’s legions. There were military defeats, of course, such as the massacre of Teutoburger Wald, but from the crushing of the Teutons and the Cimbri, the Romans enjoyed an astonishing record of destroying the armed mobs that characterized the German approach to war. From the rise of Octavian Caesar, later titled Augustus, to supremacy over the Roman world in 32 B.C. with his defeat of Mark Antony, a professional army of between twenty-five and thirty-three legions (approximately 150,000 legionnaires and 150,000 auxiliaries) defended the empire from Hadrian’s Wall in northern Britain to the upper Nile and from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Euphrates River in Syria. This indeed was an extraordinary example of economy of force. What explains this stunning military effectiveness? Above all, Roman military effectiveness depended on the discipline and training of the legionnaires, the hallmark of a professional military organization in the modern sense. Flavius Josephus, the great historian of the Roman-Jewish War of A.D. 66–70, described the Roman training regimen in the following terms:\nAnd indeed, if anyone does but attend to the other parts of [Roman] military discipline, he will be forced to confess, that their obtaining so large a dominion hath been the acquisition of their valor, and not the bare gift of fortune: for they do not begin to use their weapons first in time of war, nor do they put their hands first into motion, having been idle in times of peace; but as if their weapons were part of themselves, they never have any truce with warlike exercises; nor do they stay till times of war admonish them to use them; for their military exercises by no means fall short of the tension of real warfare, but every soldier is every day exercised, and that with real diligence, as if they were in time of war, which is why they bear the fatigue of battle so easily; … nor would he be mistaken [who] would call their exercises unbloody battles, and their battles bloody exercises. In short, the Roman army with its legions and auxiliaries was the first true professional army in history, one that relied in battle on its discipline and training rather than on the psychological glue of culture and familial and social relations. In other words, it trained as it fought. The resulting superiority allowed the Romans to dominate their world for two and a half centuries. But things fell apart in the first half of the third century. Unfortunately for historians, there are few written records for this crucial period. Between 31 B.C. and A.D. 211, excluding emperors killed in the two major civil wars, ten emperors died of natural causes and only three were assassinated by their officers or soldiers. However, in the forty-year period between A.D. 235 and 275, only one emperor died of natural causes, while no fewer than ten were assassinated by their officers or killed by barbarians, the majority via the former mode. In effect, the armies and ambitious generals tore the empire apart, while great barbarian invasions ravaged much of its territory. The problem was that of legitimacy in the transition from one emperor to the next. The great Roman historian Tacitus had suggested that the root cause of the civil war of A.D. 69–70, the year of the four emperors, was that the legions had discovered the secret of empire—namely, that they could choose the emperor.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:0d9aba3b-5482-4596-bd57-7d9e50cbe67b>']}, {'passage': 'The Brooklyn Museum’s “Killer Heels: The Art of the High-Heeled Shoe” exhibition explores the origins of high heels worn by women and men across the world since ancient times. Meanwhile, a book that was recently published under the title “Killer Heels” follows the story of high-heeled shoes through various essays and illustrations throughout history, from ancient Greece until modern times. In ancient Greece, platform sandals called “kothorni” were shoes with high wooden cork soles, worn by actors in order to differentiate the social classes and importance of each character during the play. Later, in ancient Rome, high heels were used to identify prostitutes to potential clients, therefore, high heels became associated with prostitution. In the Middle East around 1300 BC, people would wear high heels made from wood in the bath so that they would not slip on the wet floor. These wooden platform shoes were called Kabkabs, due to the sound they made when they hit the floor. During the Middle Ages, both men and women wore “pattens,” wooden soles attached to their shoes in order to keep their fragile and expensive footwear away from street mud. “Chopines,” another form of platform shoes, became popular in Turkey and throughout Europe around the 1400s until the mid-1600s. The shoes were often higher than 30 inches and women who wore them usually used canes or servants to assist them in walking.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:99aadeff-65e8-4f09-a2ca-8d52192393f6>']}]","{

The spectator is typically an all leather shoe, but can be constructed using a canvas, mesh or suede leathers. The saddle shoe, another style of two-tone oxford shoe, can be distinguished from the spectator shoe by noting the saddle shoe's plain toe and distinctive, saddle-shaped decorative panel placed mid foot. John Lobb the famous English footwear maker, claimed to have designed the first spectator shoe as a cricket shoe in 1868. The spectator was originally constructed of willow calf leather and white buck or reverse calf suede. The white portion was sometimes made from a mesh material, for better ventilation in hot weather. For women, spectator pumps have been considered, during certain periods, to be very high fashion and a kind of dress shoe, After their loss of popularity in the early 1950s, when sling-backed and sandaled, thinner pumps became stylish, they returned to fashion in the early 1980s. Perennially favorite in England, their high-fashion appeal went with the polka dot and black-and-white, red-and-white, navy-and-white, etc. combination dress ensembles trendy during this time. With their white color, spectator shoes are most appropriate for women's spring and summer wear. Spats (originally a contraction of spatterdashes) are a type of classic shoe accessory covering the instep and ankle. Spats were primarily worn in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Spats should not be confused with gaiters which are garments worn over the shoe and lower pants leg, and used primarily as protective equipment. French infantry wore white spats for parade and off duty wear until 1903. Italian soldiers wore a light tan version until 1910 and the Japanese wore long white spats or guaiters during 1905. Spats continue as a distinctive feature of the Scottish dress of Highland pipe bands, whether civilian or military. The modern Royal Regiment of Scotland, into which all Scottish line infantry regiments were amalgamated in 2006, retain white spats as part of their uniform. Prior to that date most Scottish infantry units in the British Army wore spats. For Highland regiments in kilts, spats reached halfway up the calf. For Lowland regiments in spats were visible only over the boots. Most regiments of the modern Indian Armies wear long white spats into which trousers are tucked, as part of their parade dress. Other full dress uniforms which still include spats are those of the Finnish Army. In the Finnish Navy, spats are part of the winter uniform. The U.S. Navy Honor Guard and Rifle Guard still wear them while performing ceremonies. Spats are still used as a traditional accessory in many marching band uniforms in the United States. The wearing of spats is often used as symbolic shorthand to represent wealth, eccentricity or both. The Brogue wingtip is a style of low-heeled shoe or boot traditionally characterized by multiple-piece, sturdy leather uppers with decorative holes (or \""broguing\"") and serration along the pieces' visible edges. Modern brogues trace their roots to a rudimentary shoe originating in Scottland and Ireland that was constructed using untanned hide with perforations that allowed water to drain from the shoes when the wearer crossed wet terrain such as a bog. Brogues were traditionally considered to be outdoor or country footwear not otherwise appropriate for casual or business occasions, but brogues are now considered appropriate in most contexts. Brogues are most commonly found in one of four toe cap styles (full or \""wingtip\"", semi-, quarter and longwing) and four closure styles oxford, derby, ghillie and monk. Today, in addition to their typical form of sturdy leather shoes or boots, brogues may also take the form of business dress shoes and sneakers or any other shoe form that utilizes or evokes the multi-piece construction and perforated, serrated piece edges characteristic of brogues. 10 18 13"",

                ""text"": ""Those Spartans. Those magnificent, well-accessorized Spartans. Although the Athenians get more credit for \u201cphilosophy\u201d and \u201cart\u201d and \u201cculture\u201d and stuff, it\u2019s the Spartans who could teach us a thing or two about dressing for demanding conditions in a harsh climate. From their jaunty red capes (carefully tailored to provide maximum warming to the deltoids and trapeziuses while bearing abs so killer that a single view would send most foes fleeing for their very lives) to their excellent footwear, those Spartans knew how to accessorize and rock a killa uniform. And how about those sandals! They provide maximum shin protection while exposing the heel to cooling upward drafts from the wells into which one must, from time to time, kick emissaries from enemy nations. What great dual action! Not to mention their undeniable wow factor. Clearly, the Spartans knew from sandals. So why is it that the Romans have become so well-woven into the cobbler\u2019s lexicon? And how is it that they get so much credit for their version of the Spartan shoe that we now refer to as soi-disant \u201cgladiator sandals\u201d? Those Romans! They knew a thing or two about swiping other cultures\u2019 excellent ideas and taking credit for them. Historical documents like 300 and Gladiator clearly reveal (as MoT\u2018s resident Shoeologist confirms from her painstaking graduate-level research) the way the Romans adopted the general idea of the Spartan sandal, enhanced its strappiness and added a bit o\u2019 imperial beadazzling, and faster than you can say quod erat demonstrandum, a new kicks craze was born. Two millennia later we\u2019ve yet to kick it. Tall and strappy (and we mean really tall and really strappy) sandals have come and gone through the years, but got a whole new lease on life when Chanel trotted out its resort collection back in 2007. Behold the \u00fcber-gladiator sandal:\nAll of us here at MoT HQ were gaga about the whole get up; you can bet your big floppy sun hat that those of us who look like Chanel models and did our best to emulate it. (Especially on weekly bikini day.) Those of us who look more like we have a few children or graduate degrees (or both in equal numbers) stayed away from the tall sandals, not quite sure they were quite the thing for the office, the grocery store, the kids\u2019 soccer field and so on. And even if we had, we would worry about getting funky tan lines on the three days of the summer we actually got to go outside to play. (And it was awfully hard to source those matching strappy glove things.) While foregoing the knee-high glads, we supported anyone who could pull off this look with a hearty brava. But now we are faced with something new under the sun\u2013or at least, a new version this old something. Instead of being under the sun, it ought to be kept locked behind closed doors. It appears that, having stretched the sandal to what to most eyes appeared to be its limit (reaching boot-like heights but still maintaining identity of a sandal), shoe designers have taken a regrettable turn by hybridizing the two kinds of footwear. Such unions sometimes result in wonderful offspring: witness the marriage of Mary Jane and Stiletto performed by Manolo Blahnik. The mongrel rolling off the runways this season is a sad, ugly marriage. And it needs to stop. Philosophically, functionally and aesthetically, these sandal-plus-leg-warmer-ankle-shackle get ups are an absolute travesty of shoedom. This approach to shoe design is a crime, and Matters of Taste is here to save you from being a victim. Or a perpetrator. For your personal safety, read on. In this exemplary offering, the shin/ankle element has been reduced from its earlier (ca. 2007 Chanel) heights that recalled gladiators and warriors and made us all feel pretty Xena-esque. This short version can only be appropriate for people whose jobs involve a whip (at either end) or a pole, and we think that alluding to such is in the worst of taste. The color! The fringe! How is it that they couldn\u2019t have worked some sequins in to make this part of the uniform for people who work at establishments with a name like \u201cVelvet Angels\u201d?"",

### Context: For every bottle of red wine, there is a perfect food pairing. While there’s no strict rule as to what you should eat with your favourite red wine, especially because everyone has different palettes and preferences, there are certain reasons why wine connoisseurs make specific food and wine pairing suggestions. If you’re new to the world of developing your wine palette, that’s okay! Half the fun is understanding what notes to look for, learning what the different bodies of wine are, and what flavours best match its notes. Have you ever been sent to the liquor store with instructions to “buy red wine” but you aren’t sure what kind to get? Surely there has to be certain meanings behind each kind. We’re here to tell you that yes, each kind is completely different. Below, we’ll go over the differences (in alphabetical order) between the types of red wines so you’ll never have to feel confused about which kind to buy again. These types of grapes do well in a cooler climate, therefore, they thrive in Ontario (though they originated in France). They’re known for being very flavourful with earthy and spicy notes which is why they’re used to create drier red wines. These types of grapes thrive in both humid and cooler environments. They’re the most common type of grape that mainly come from places like Napa Valley, Australia, and the Niagara Region. They’re a little more fruity, acidic, and a deeper colour of red. If you’re looking for a unique combination, you’ll love this type of red wine that’s popularly found in Niagara. It’s often mixed with Merlot or Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and then aged in oak barrels. The oak barrels bring out the unique flavours even more and provide a more “dry” structure to the wine. This is another very popular type of grape because of its ease to mix with others and to try drinking for beginners. It’s often soft, smooth, sweet, and makes a great math for any dish or dessert. Malbec grapes are most famously known for growing in Argentina even though they originated in France. Because of these grapes being darker and thicker skinned, their sweetness and fruity flavours create a less-dry red wine. Known as one of the lighter reds, Pinot Noir wine is fruity, smoothy, and much like Merlot, it can make the perfect match for any dish or dessert. But did you know that Pinot Noir grapes are the hardest to grow? Because of their thin skin, they’re more susceptible to being damaged by temperatures or by themselves since they grow tightly together. Zinfandel is largely grown in the United States in more humid climates like Napa Valley and Lodi. It makes for a very fruity red wine but on the other hand, has subtle flavours of licorice and tobacco. It’s another wine that’s very easy to drink, making it the perfect pairing for most dishes. Note: Full, medium and light-bodied refers to the alcohol content. The fuller the body of wine, the higher alcohol content it contains (more than 13.5%). The lighter the body of wine, the lower the alcohol content (less than 12.5%). Nothing pairs together more perfectly than wine and food, especially after you’ve had a long day or you haven’t spent a night out (or in) with your friends in a long time. But how do you decide what to order with your glass of wine? Remember, the choice is completely up to you and your specific preferences, but here are the best wine and food pairings strictly based on the types of notes the red wine contains. Red meat, whether it be land, grilled steak, or burgers, make a great match for Cabernet Sauvignon. This type of full-bodied red wine has strong, deep and fruity flavours, so pairing it with equally strong meat flavours will make for a delicious dinner you won’t soon forget. The meat can also dial down the acidity and sweetness of the wine if that’s what you desire. If you’re opting for a hearty stew such as beef bourguignon, for example, Merlot is a great wine pairing to bring out the soft flavours of both the dish and the wine.

Types of Red Wine
Learn about Merlot, Malbec, and more in this list of red wine types. Red wine is like a lot of other topics that people are passionate about. There’s an overwhelming amount of information you can learn about red wine. There are dozens of varietals that are made all over the world. There are single varietal wines (wines made from a single type of grape) and red wine blends. There are wines named after the grape they are made from, and there are wines named after the region in which the wine was made. You can learn about different vintage years in different parts of the world, and you can learn about what different weather and climate conditions mean for the finished wine. In short: there’s a lot to learn about red wine. However, red wine is also like other topics that people are passionate about in this way:
You can generally get along just fine by knowing a few basics. That’s what we’re here to discuss. We’ll cover a few basic red wine types that you’ll find on almost any restaurant menu. We’ll cover what these wines taste like, any notable facts about the wine, and what types of food you can pair it with. It’s your cheat sheet to types of red wine. Pinot Noir wine is light-bodied, light red in color, and translucent. The flavor is subtle and has low tannins, but the acidity is nice and bright. The taste is fruity and delicate; you will probably find notes of cherry, strawberry, or raspberry. Earthy flavors may also be present, which is why this wine pairs well with recipes with mushrooms. This is a popular wine, and wine enthusiasts study its complex flavor and unique grape. Try this affordable Pinot Noir: DeLoach Heritage Reserve Pinot Noir

There are two names for this variety of wine. European vintners only use the name “Syrah.” The wine is well known as a dark, almost inky, full-bodied wine. It is very smooth and has flavors of dark fruit such as blackcurrant and plum; this is a hearty, often spicy, red. Syrah has gripping tannins and is excellent when paired with red meat or other bold, flavorful foods. It is also a nice complement to many soft or stinky cheeses.

This full-bodied red wine is made mostly in Argentina, with some wine coming out of France. French and Argentinian varieties taste very different. A Malbec from Argentina (which is the most popular) is fruit forward, with flavors of blackberry and plum. A French Malbec is tarter (black plum, currant), with higher acidity and peppery flavors. This wine pairs well with dark meat poultry, lean red meats, and funky flavors like blue cheese and mushroom.

Pairing Food and Wine
Throw out the old rules-of-thumb
There are a whole bunch of rules-of thumb that have developed over the years
- Serve white wine with fish or white meat and red wine with red meat
- Serve red wine at room temperature (whatever that might be)
- You only decant red wine
- Serve white wine cold
All of which only have the tiniest speck of truth, if any at all. Our particular bug bear is cold white wine. Most restaurant serve white wine at the same temperature as lager. What this achieves is to make the wine hide away – no nose and almost no taste. Which is kind of what we think of lager! Older wines and aromatic wines should be served only lightly chilled – around 15C. But, this section is about pairing food and wine. It’s not about rules but about a framework in which to decide what goes with what. We are indebted to Katarina van Niekerk and Brian Burke who have written a very good and extensive book called The Food & Wine Pairing Guide (Struik Lifestyle, Cape Town, 2009) for the basis of what we have written here. If you want to find out more we suggest you buy their book (e-book available on Apple and Amazon). Their framework contains just three things to consider when you are selecting a wine to accompany a dish; weight; flavour intensity; and the role of the five primary taste sensations. See below for more details on each. The weight of a dish is the most important thing to take into account and one should always aim to balance the weight of the food with the weight of the wine, so that neither overwhelms the other. The food range from light to heavy is, for example, white fish; chicken; grilled meats; hearty stews. For white wines it is Pinot Gris; Riesling; Sauvignon Blanc; unoaked Chardonnay; Semillon; oaked Chardonnay. And for red wines, Pinot Noir; merlot; Malbec; Shiraz; Cabernet Sauvignon. So chicken, for example, pairs well with the heavier whites and the lighter reds. Although cold roast chicken goes well with an off-dry, low alcohol, Riesling on Sunday evenings. But the biggest challenge is often posed by the sauce in the dish - sauces rule. Many people choose a creamy pepper or mushroom sauce to go with grilled steak. Together, this makes for a heavy dish that needs to be paired with an equally heavy wine. The creaminess of the sauce demands an equally creamy wine. A buttery, velvety, oaked Chardonnay or Semillon provides both the weight that the steak needs and the creamy texture that the sauce demands. By flavour intensity we mean the degree of flavour that a dish has; ranging from bland to spicy. Again one should aim to balance the flavour intensity of the wine and the food. Flavour intensity for white wine ranges from the subtlety of a Pinot Gris or an unoaked Chardonnay (think Chablis) up through Rieslings to Sauvignon Blanc (especially New World Sauvignons) or Gewürztraminer. For red wines Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz and Grenache (southern Rhone wines) have far more flavour intensity than Pinot Noir. But we think the distinction is far more along the new world / old world dimension; new world reds having far more flavour intensity than old world wines. From food’s perspective the subtle flavour end of the range is with light coloured meat and fish or red meat with little fat such as fillet. At the intense flavour end are the dark coloured meats and fish or meats with lots of fat such as lamb or prime rib. The five primary taste sensations
Wines and foods share some basic tastes. Physically, we have taste buds that give us the intrinsic ability to register five primary taste sensations in the mouth: sweetness; acidity; saltiness; bitterness and umami (or 'savoury'). Each of these five tastes is present to some degree, and in various combinations and permutations, in all foods. Wine is also a combination of primary tastes, usually three: sweetness; acidity (sourness) and, in the case of red wine, umami. These combinations define a wine's profile and determine with what food it is best served.

And the majority of the time, when you’re serving wine, there will be some sort of food involved. So it’s important to know the basics of food & wine pairing. Right now, there’s only one principle that you need to be aware of when you’re matching wine with food: The lighter the food, the lighter the wine. The richer the food, the richer the wine. It’s as simple as that. For example, red meats, like beef and lamb, are considered to be rich and heavy foods. According to the principle, that means that they would match very well with a rich and heavy wine. Like a full-bodied red wine. On the other side of the spectrum, oysters are a very light and delicate food. So they wouldn’t match very well with a rich full-bodied red wine. But they would match extremely well with a lighter styled wine, like a sparkling wine or a light-bodied white wine. If you only applied this principal, most of the time, you would nail your food & wine pairings. But what about the food & wine that land in the middle of the spectrum? For example, what type of food would go well with a light-bodied red wine or a full-bodied white wine? Well, the answer isn’t a simple as ‘this food goes with that’ or ‘that wine goes with this’. Most foods go well with a few different styles of wine and vice-versa. And it takes a bit of experimentation and memorization to learn what types of food go well with what styles of wine. It also depends on what people like. In part 4, we’ll give you some specific details of what types of wine go with what types of food. For now, it’s sufficient enough to know that light foods, go with light wines. And rich foods, go with rich wines. We’ve just been through a lot there. So take your time with it. Once you have a solid understanding of how to taste wine, describe it, and pair wine with food, you’ll have developed all the tools you need to learn about wine and confidently talk about it with anyone. In part 3 of this guide, you’ll be learning how to put those tools to practical use as a bartender. You’ll learn how to recommend wine you know the customer will enjoy. And then you’ll learn how to serve it like a pro. Until then, remember my sommelier friend’s advice, ‘In order to learn about wine, you must drink wine!’ So go out there, buy a few bottles, and start doing your ‘research’.

Undoubtedly, it can be confusing when it comes to choosing the perfect wine with different food, especially if you are new in the field. That is why we have compiled some fundamentals tips and advice to help you pair your wine and food in the correct way below. Here’s What You Need to Know for Great Wine and Food Pairings
There Need to Have More Acidic than the Meal
You need to choose a wine having a very sour or sharp taste; in other words, the amount of acidic should be higher than your food. In this way, you will enjoy the wine much better. The Food Should Be Less Sweeter than the Wine
Undoubtedly, the food you are having need to contain less sugar than the wine you are drinking. Else, you will not genuinely have the authentic taste of the wine. Drink Low-Alcohol Wine with Spicy Foods
It is advisable to drink wine with a low amount of alcohol with spicy food since this can cause stomach burn and deprive you of the wine’s actual taste due to the burning sensation in the mouth. Red Meat is Best to Drink Red Wine With
If you have red meat for a meal, consider having a glass of red wine to make the meal more delicious. Red meat with red wine has always been the best combination that could exist. Choose Lighter Wine for Dessert
When having dessert, it is advisable to choose lighter consistency of wine. This will allow you to enjoy your dessert to its authentic taste, especially if it contains sugar. Cheese and Rosé Wine is an Excellent Combination
Have you ever tried Rosé wine with cheese? If not, you are imperatively missing something excellent. Consider tasting both, and see how delicious the meal will be.

Because you won’t be able to describe a wine to customers if you don’t know what to describe in the first place! The 5 principle characteristics of wine are:
- Flavour Profile (fruit, oak, earth, other)
The first element you need to be aware of is the ‘body’ of the wine. The ‘body’ is simply a way of categorizing different styles of wine from lightest to boldest. In general, knowing the body of a wine is as simple as knowing the grape variety. Because most of the time, grape varieties share the same ‘body’ regardless of how or where the wine was made. Red wines are categorized into light-bodied, medium-bodied, and full-bodied wines. Whereas white wines are categorized into light-bodied, full-bodied, and aromatic wines. The difference between these styles of wine will be obvious once you’ve tasted them side by side. But a great way to think about them is to compare the difference between skim and full cream milk. Full cream milk is much richer and fuller in flavor than skim milk. The same can be said for full-bodied wine in comparison to light-bodied wine. With medium-bodied wine landing somewhere in the middle. The aromatic white wines category simply means that the wine will have highly perfumed and sweet fruit aromas. Although that doesn’t necessarily mean that the wine itself will be sweet. The sweetness/dryness of a wine is referring to how much residual sugar is left in the wine (i.e. how sweet the wine is). If there’s a lot, you’ll describe the wine as ‘very sweet’. If there’s hardly any, you’ll describe the wine as ‘very dry’. This is a characteristic you’ll need to describe with all white, sparkling, and rosé wines. But you won’t need to worry about describing the sweetness levels of red wines as they all have some element of sweetness. Customers will commonly ask you for dry white wines. Even though the majority of white wines are dry, it generally means that they’re looking for the driest wine possible. Acids are what gives a wine its sour/tart flavor. When you taste citrus (lemon, lime, orange) in a wine, it’s because the wine has some element of acidity. You can also feel a wine’s level of acidity because it will make your mouth water. This is an important characteristic to describe with all styles of wine. All white wines have some element of citrus which makes tasting the acidity obvious. But red wines can have high levels of acids too. But because red wines have higher amounts of sugar, the sweetness balances out the acids so they’re not as obvious (think about balancing simple syrup with lemon/lime juice in cocktails). The sauvignon blanc white wine is a great example of what a wine with high acidity tastes like. It tastes sour, there are strong elements of citrus, and it makes your mouth water. Tannins are unique to red wines. So you don’t need to worry about describing them when you’re dealing with white wines. Tannins are what cause the grippy/drying feeling on your tongue and that’s how you’ll recognize them. A high tannin wine will almost make your tongue feel numb. This is an important characteristic to cover when you’re describing red wines. If you’re looking for an example of tannin, you only need to taste a young vintage Cabernet Sauvignon red wine and you’ll know exactly what I mean. This is when a glass of wine starts to get interesting. When I mentioned in part 1 that the astute wine drinker can pick up tobacco, mint, vanilla, citrus, cherry, and even sweaty socks in a glass of wine, this is what I was talking about. The flavor profile of a wine is essential every flavor/scent that we can smell in the wine. There are a lot of different flavors in this world, even within wine. So to make understanding them easier, they can be broken down into 4 major categories: fruit, oak, earth, and the catchall ‘other.’
When you taste & smell wine you should try and identify any flavors (or lack thereof) from each of these categories. Every wine has some element of fruit in it. Some of these fruits are out there and more exotic, whilst others are a lot more familiar and closer to home.

Wine is meant to have a partner. Food. As the two enter their union, the full flavors of both the wine and food stretch throughout all of the lovely layers and deepen the satiation and satisfaction of the dining experience. When I am in Bend, I look to our local grocer Newport Market to help me pick out my wine and trust the wine buyers there to not only recommend but share what they love about a particular wine. If I am picking out a wine to pair with a dish I have never made, I look no further than Suzi who has always steered me in delicious directions. From pairing with seafood to trout to lamb to paella, she suggests varying price points and leaves me to decide. Perhaps that is the key as well, know who to ask and who to trust for recommendations. For nine years when I lived near Walla Walla, Washington’s nearly 100 wineries, I trusted my own palate as we would visit the tasting rooms, often without a fee (and if there was a fee, it was $5 that could go toward your wine purchase), but that option is not available unless I travel now that I live in central Oregon – which perhaps is yet another reason to travel. 🙂
However, to stick to hard-and-fast rules about what wine should go with what, while something to consider and inquire as to why, shouldn’t be adhered to absolutely nor blindly. Drink what you like, like what you drink was often a motto I would hear and for the most part, agree with. What I would add would be to just remember to pair it with food you enjoy as well. The entire flavor profile of the wine and the food when partnered, as mentioned above, changes, and often those traditional pairing suggestions reveal their wisdom. From something as simple as a luscious red cabernet-blend paired with a hamburger nestled between a brioche bun to a bouillabaisse paired with a light, crisp sauvignon blanc or viognier, if there is food, there is a wine that will pair with it and the experience will be all the more scrumptious and memorable because of it. There are many books available to deepen your knowledge of wine. Depending upon what your sense of humor, depth of curiosity and any other preference, there is a book for you. I have gathered up a few below. For the Cook

I love it!”
Say it about a full-bodied red wine: “You have to try this! It’s just unbelievably rich, and weighty, like taking a big gulp of whole milk — or even chocolate milk — and it’s totally hedonistic and delicious.”
Like acidity, sweetness is a taste that can be perceived by the tongue. Sweetness can be balanced by other components in the wine, particularly acid and tannin, so sweetness can be cloying or help smooth out the wine, depending on the overall balance. Say it about an off-dry (almost imperceptibly) sweet wine: “Oh, this is good. There’ just a hint of sweetness on the tip of my tongue, but there’s lots of juicy acidity to keep it lively and fresh.”
Say it about a fully sweet white wine: “This is unreal! It’s just everything you ever wanted in a dessert wine — it’s rich and unctuous and viscous and beautifully sweet, like the best 3-Michelin-Star dessert you’ve ever had, only liquified!”
And there you have it. For practicality’s sake, the wines curated in our Wine Access store each include a flavor profile to help you understand the complexities of the wine. These flavor profiles provide a deeper understanding of each wine so you can pinpoint the attributes you enjoy in wine. And with this guide, you can really know (or at least sound like you know) what you’re talking about when you’re talking about a wine.

You may have noticed that we've begun to incorporate pairing suggestions with some of our products, beginning with our red meats, like a Bonanza Cabernet Sauvignon by Caymus with our Chuck Roast (one of Bryce's favorites). We believe it's fairly common knowledge that red wines go well with red meat and, on the flip side, it's common for white wines to be paired with lighter meats, especially fish. And while grabbing any wine willy nilly is likely to enhance your dining experience, we think you'll find the art of intentional pairing to be quite rewarding. It certainly causes us to be more present in the dining moment, and remain more conscious of the flavor profiles for the entire meal. We thought some of you may not be convinced right off the bat so we decided to bring science and some beginner tips to the table to get you started. First, off, why red with red and white with white? Red wines tend to be heavier in body and more robust in taste than white wine. The same can be said about red and white meat. Thus, if you were to pair red wine with tilapia, there's a good chance you'll see the flavors of the tilapia overpowered and wiped out by the red wine. It doesn't get much more complicated than that, at least at the early beginners level. If you're already on board with the red-red/white-white concept, then here are some additional tips and pairings that may interest you. The GOLDEN RULE: Taste is Subjective
Always remember what you taste is personal. If a combination pleases you then it is a good choice. Focus on the Dominant Flavors
While we just took up your time going on and on about pairing with meats, it's important to remember that the meat may not always be the dominant flavor of the dish. Did you make a crazy good, crazy flavorful sauce to go with it? There's your pairing target! When in Doubt, Pinot Noir
Pinot Noir is notorious for having a light-medium body. It's sort of in the middle on the whole spectrum which helps it go with many foods. More Sweet, More Acidic
This one is a simple and generic, but highly effective trick that's likely to take your pairing ability and experience to the next level. The wine should [almost] always be more acidic and sweeter than the food. Spice High, Alcohol Content Low
Alcohol amplifies the oils that make spicy food hot. Stick to wines that are low in alcohol, such as off-dry German Rieslings. Smoke with Oak
Oaked wines are often more intense, and therefore they can overwhelm the flavors in a dish. By pairing them with foods that match that intensity, you'll find the strong oak notes suddenly tamed and the fruit flavors of the wine will be brought out instead. All the Things
Finally, here's a nice all-around reference to help you figure this all out. As a reminder though, the most important rule is to do what you like and have fun. Cheers!

A simple approach to wine buying is to match the acidity of the wine with the acidity of the dish. That’s because you don’t want the acidity of the food to overpower the wine. Both white and red wines (depending on the darkness of the skins) can be acidic depending on how they were made (like being aged in an oak barrel versus a steel barrel). Some foods, like chicken and pork, can go with either white or red wine depending on how they’re prepared. Generally, I suggest a white wine for either, and maybe a rosé (often midway in its acidity – thus one of my favorite food wine pairs) or light red, depending on the overall flavor. As for red wines, the skins and seeds included in the pressing and fermentation release even more tannic acids and alcohols into the wines – creating the flavor and color. Remember that with red wines, the lighter the wine color, the lower the tannins. That’s what creates the spectrum, varying levels of tannins. Fatty foods like steak require heavy-tannin reds like cabernets and merlots. Meanwhile, light to moderate fatty foods like salmon or pork can pair well with a light red like a pinot or Chianti. Finally, there’s one more rule for simple pairing… Pair spice with sweet. Sweeter wines, especially whites like riesling, tend to pair better with spicier foods like Thai and Mexican. That’s because sweeter wines help coat your burning tongue (from the spiciness) with sugars. Keep in mind, lower alcohol wines, like riesling and moscato, are also gentler on your palate as you enjoy spicy foods. These are my basic rules for wine pairing:
- Focus on your taste and what you imagine it tastes like. - Make a guess as to how many tannins are in the wine. Weigh that against how heavy and acidic your food is… lemon mango salsa grilled tuna needs a bright acidic white wine with texture and body. A heavy rib eye with gravy and potatoes needs a dark and perhaps oaked red wine. And in between, say turkey or ham deserves a heavier white wine, a crisp rosé or lighter red. - Pair spicy with sweet. To make it even easier, here’s a list I put together for the most common food and wine pairings…
- Fish: White
- Pork: Rosé or white
- Chicken: White or light red
- Beef: Red
- Pasta: Light red, though richer pasta dishes need acidic and ageable red wines
Keep in mind, these are general rules based on food chemistry. You may find varieties of wines that go better with your meal but appear to break these rules. An old classmate of mine from graduate school at Kellogg once wrote to tell me he’d just had my Eifrig Cabernet Sauvignon with grilled swordfish on the beach. I loved it… it’s easy to see how my reds could balance the meatier texture of swordfish. And the oil and richness of the fish was complemented by the perfectly balanced acids and heavier tannins of my cabernet. Remember… The best part of learning about wine is trying and discovering what you like! The most important thing is that the value of wine tasting lies with you, the individual taster. Spending hundreds of dollars on a “good” bottle of wine doesn’t mean you’ll enjoy it (unless it’s mine of course). The best way to experience new wines pre-coronavirus was to stop by a local wine store for free tastings – often done several times a month. In some places and states, they might still be doing this… just call the store or check its website to see when it offers an event. It’s a great way to sample wine for free and get closer to finding your ideal wine. Likewise, when I’m dining out, I always ask the wait staff what they’d recommend with my dish and then ask them to get me a sip of a couple ideas before I pick what I want.

- Something different: We owe Milli Vanilli an apology.","[{'passage': 'For every bottle of red wine, there is a perfect food pairing. While there’s no strict rule as to what you should eat with your favourite red wine, especially because everyone has different palettes and preferences, there are certain reasons why wine connoisseurs make specific food and wine pairing suggestions. If you’re new to the world of developing your wine palette, that’s okay! Half the fun is understanding what notes to look for, learning what the different bodies of wine are, and what flavours best match its notes. Have you ever been sent to the liquor store with instructions to “buy red wine” but you aren’t sure what kind to get? Surely there has to be certain meanings behind each kind. We’re here to tell you that yes, each kind is completely different. Below, we’ll go over the differences (in alphabetical order) between the types of red wines so you’ll never have to feel confused about which kind to buy again. These types of grapes do well in a cooler climate, therefore, they thrive in Ontario (though they originated in France). They’re known for being very flavourful with earthy and spicy notes which is why they’re used to create drier red wines. These types of grapes thrive in both humid and cooler environments. They’re the most common type of grape that mainly come from places like Napa Valley, Australia, and the Niagara Region. They’re a little more fruity, acidic, and a deeper colour of red. If you’re looking for a unique combination, you’ll love this type of red wine that’s popularly found in Niagara. It’s often mixed with Merlot or Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and then aged in oak barrels. The oak barrels bring out the unique flavours even more and provide a more “dry” structure to the wine. This is another very popular type of grape because of its ease to mix with others and to try drinking for beginners. It’s often soft, smooth, sweet, and makes a great math for any dish or dessert. Malbec grapes are most famously known for growing in Argentina even though they originated in France. Because of these grapes being darker and thicker skinned, their sweetness and fruity flavours create a less-dry red wine. Known as one of the lighter reds, Pinot Noir wine is fruity, smoothy, and much like Merlot, it can make the perfect match for any dish or dessert. But did you know that Pinot Noir grapes are the hardest to grow? Because of their thin skin, they’re more susceptible to being damaged by temperatures or by themselves since they grow tightly together. Zinfandel is largely grown in the United States in more humid climates like Napa Valley and Lodi. It makes for a very fruity red wine but on the other hand, has subtle flavours of licorice and tobacco. It’s another wine that’s very easy to drink, making it the perfect pairing for most dishes. Note: Full, medium and light-bodied refers to the alcohol content. The fuller the body of wine, the higher alcohol content it contains (more than 13.5%). The lighter the body of wine, the lower the alcohol content (less than 12.5%). Nothing pairs together more perfectly than wine and food, especially after you’ve had a long day or you haven’t spent a night out (or in) with your friends in a long time. But how do you decide what to order with your glass of wine? Remember, the choice is completely up to you and your specific preferences, but here are the best wine and food pairings strictly based on the types of notes the red wine contains. Red meat, whether it be land, grilled steak, or burgers, make a great match for Cabernet Sauvignon. This type of full-bodied red wine has strong, deep and fruity flavours, so pairing it with equally strong meat flavours will make for a delicious dinner you won’t soon forget. The meat can also dial down the acidity and sweetness of the wine if that’s what you desire. If you’re opting for a hearty stew such as beef bourguignon, for example, Merlot is a great wine pairing to bring out the soft flavours of both the dish and the wine.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:4f359aa1-c466-4885-a308-88f6dde8288b>']}, {'passage': ""Types of Red Wine\nLearn about Merlot, Malbec, and more in this list of red wine types. Red wine is like a lot of other topics that people are passionate about. There’s an overwhelming amount of information you can learn about red wine. There are dozens of varietals that are made all over the world. There are single varietal wines (wines made from a single type of grape) and red wine blends. There are wines named after the grape they are made from, and there are wines named after the region in which the wine was made. You can learn about different vintage years in different parts of the world, and you can learn about what different weather and climate conditions mean for the finished wine. In short: there’s a lot to learn about red wine. However, red wine is also like other topics that people are passionate about in this way:\nYou can generally get along just fine by knowing a few basics. That’s what we’re here to discuss. We’ll cover a few basic red wine types that you’ll find on almost any restaurant menu. We’ll cover what these wines taste like, any notable facts about the wine, and what types of food you can pair it with. It’s your cheat sheet to types of red wine. Pinot Noir wine is light-bodied, light red in color, and translucent. The flavor is subtle and has low tannins, but the acidity is nice and bright. The taste is fruity and delicate; you will probably find notes of cherry, strawberry, or raspberry. Earthy flavors may also be present, which is why this wine pairs well with recipes with mushrooms. This is a popular wine, and wine enthusiasts study its complex flavor and unique grape.

It’s full-bodied and has strong tannins. The aroma often has notes of dark cherry and vanilla, and tasting notes may be herbaceous and have hints of green pepper. Cabernet Sauvignons are excellent complements to food and go well with steak and other rich red meat dishes.

Syrah (or Shiraz)\nThere are two names for this variety of wine. European vintners only use the name “Syrah.” The wine is well known as a dark, almost inky, full-bodied wine. It is very smooth and has flavors of dark fruit such as blackcurrant and plum; this is a hearty, often spicy, red. Syrah has gripping tannins and is excellent when paired with red meat or other bold, flavorful foods. It is also a nice complement to many soft or stinky cheeses.

Our particular bug bear is cold white wine. Most restaurant serve white wine at the same temperature as lager. What this achieves is to make the wine hide away – no nose and almost no taste. Which is kind of what we think of lager! Older wines and aromatic wines should be served only lightly chilled – around 15C. But, this section is about pairing food and wine. It’s not about rules but about a framework in which to decide what goes with what. We are indebted to Katarina van Niekerk and Brian Burke who have written a very good and extensive book called The Food & Wine Pairing Guide (Struik Lifestyle, Cape Town, 2009) for the basis of what we have written here. If you want to find out more we suggest you buy their book (e-book available on Apple and Amazon). Their framework contains just three things to consider when you are selecting a wine to accompany a dish; weight; flavour intensity; and the role of the five primary taste sensations. See below for more details on each. The weight of a dish is the most important thing to take into account and one should always aim to balance the weight of the food with the weight of the wine, so that neither overwhelms the other. The food range from light to heavy is, for example, white fish; chicken; grilled meats; hearty stews. For white wines it is Pinot Gris; Riesling; Sauvignon Blanc; unoaked Chardonnay; Semillon; oaked Chardonnay. And for red wines, Pinot Noir; merlot; Malbec; Shiraz; Cabernet Sauvignon. So chicken, for example, pairs well with the heavier whites and the lighter reds. Although cold roast chicken goes well with an off-dry, low alcohol, Riesling on Sunday evenings. But the biggest challenge is often posed by the sauce in the dish - sauces rule. Many people choose a creamy pepper or mushroom sauce to go with grilled steak. Together, this makes for a heavy dish that needs to be paired with an equally heavy wine. The creaminess of the sauce demands an equally creamy wine. A buttery, velvety, oaked Chardonnay or Semillon provides both the weight that the steak needs and the creamy texture that the sauce demands. By flavour intensity we mean the degree of flavour that a dish has; ranging from bland to spicy. Again one should aim to balance the flavour intensity of the wine and the food. Flavour intensity for white wine ranges from the subtlety of a Pinot Gris or an unoaked Chardonnay (think Chablis) up through Rieslings to Sauvignon Blanc (especially New World Sauvignons) or Gewürztraminer. For red wines Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz and Grenache (southern Rhone wines) have far more flavour intensity than Pinot Noir. But we think the distinction is far more along the new world / old world dimension; new world reds having far more flavour intensity than old world wines. From food’s perspective the subtle flavour end of the range is with light coloured meat and fish or red meat with little fat such as fillet. At the intense flavour end are the dark coloured meats and fish or meats with lots of fat such as lamb or prime rib. The five primary taste sensations\nWines and foods share some basic tastes. Physically, we have taste buds that give us the intrinsic ability to register five primary taste sensations in the mouth: sweetness; acidity; saltiness; bitterness and umami (or 'savoury'). Each of these five tastes is present to some degree, and in various combinations and permutations, in all foods. Wine is also a combination of primary tastes, usually three: sweetness; acidity (sourness) and, in the case of red wine, umami. These combinations define a wine's profile and determine with what food it is best served."", 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:b3db4d4b-49df-4c28-bb87-69e6c3e27e32>']}, {'passage': 'And the majority of the time, when you’re serving wine, there will be some sort of food involved. So it’s important to know the basics of food & wine pairing. Right now, there’s only one principle that you need to be aware of when you’re matching wine with food: The lighter the food, the lighter the wine. The richer the food, the richer the wine. It’s as simple as that. For example, red meats, like beef and lamb, are considered to be rich and heavy foods. According to the principle, that means that they would match very well with a rich and heavy wine. Like a full-bodied red wine. On the other side of the spectrum, oysters are a very light and delicate food. So they wouldn’t match very well with a rich full-bodied red wine. But they would match extremely well with a lighter styled wine, like a sparkling wine or a light-bodied white wine. If you only applied this principal, most of the time, you would nail your food & wine pairings. But what about the food & wine that land in the middle of the spectrum? For example, what type of food would go well with a light-bodied red wine or a full-bodied white wine? Well, the answer isn’t a simple as ‘this food goes with that’ or ‘that wine goes with this’. Most foods go well with a few different styles of wine and vice-versa. And it takes a bit of experimentation and memorization to learn what types of food go well with what styles of wine. It also depends on what people like. In part 4, we’ll give you some specific details of what types of wine go with what types of food. For now, it’s sufficient enough to know that light foods, go with light wines. And rich foods, go with rich wines. We’ve just been through a lot there. So take your time with it.

The 5 principle characteristics of wine are:\n- Flavour Profile (fruit, oak, earth, other)\nThe first element you need to be aware of is the ‘body’ of the wine. The ‘body’ is simply a way of categorizing different styles of wine from lightest to boldest. In general, knowing the body of a wine is as simple as knowing the grape variety. Because most of the time, grape varieties share the same ‘body’ regardless of how or where the wine was made. Red wines are categorized into light-bodied, medium-bodied, and full-bodied wines. Whereas white wines are categorized into light-bodied, full-bodied, and aromatic wines. The difference between these styles of wine will be obvious once you’ve tasted them side by side. But a great way to think about them is to compare the difference between skim and full cream milk. Full cream milk is much richer and fuller in flavor than skim milk. The same can be said for full-bodied wine in comparison to light-bodied wine. With medium-bodied wine landing somewhere in the middle. The aromatic white wines category simply means that the wine will have highly perfumed and sweet fruit aromas. Although that doesn’t necessarily mean that the wine itself will be sweet. The sweetness/dryness of a wine is referring to how much residual sugar is left in the wine (i.e. how sweet the wine is). If there’s a lot, you’ll describe the wine as ‘very sweet’. If there’s hardly any, you’ll describe the wine as ‘very dry’. This is a characteristic you’ll need to describe with all white, sparkling, and rosé wines. But you won’t need to worry about describing the sweetness levels of red wines as they all have some element of sweetness. Customers will commonly ask you for dry white wines. Even though the majority of white wines are dry, it generally means that they’re looking for the driest wine possible. Acids are what gives a wine its sour/tart flavor. When you taste citrus (lemon, lime, orange) in a wine, it’s because the wine has some element of acidity. You can also feel a wine’s level of acidity because it will make your mouth water. This is an important characteristic to describe with all styles of wine. All white wines have some element of citrus which makes tasting the acidity obvious. But red wines can have high levels of acids too. But because red wines have higher amounts of sugar, the sweetness balances out the acids so they’re not as obvious (think about balancing simple syrup with lemon/lime juice in cocktails). The sauvignon blanc white wine is a great example of what a wine with high acidity tastes like. It tastes sour, there are strong elements of citrus, and it makes your mouth water. Tannins are unique to red wines. So you don’t need to worry about describing them when you’re dealing with white wines. Tannins are what cause the grippy/drying feeling on your tongue and that’s how you’ll recognize them. A high tannin wine will almost make your tongue feel numb. This is an important characteristic to cover when you’re describing red wines. If you’re looking for an example of tannin, you only need to taste a young vintage Cabernet Sauvignon red wine and you’ll know exactly what I mean. This is when a glass of wine starts to get interesting. When I mentioned in part 1 that the astute wine drinker can pick up tobacco, mint, vanilla, citrus, cherry, and even sweaty socks in a glass of wine, this is what I was talking about. The flavor profile of a wine is essential every flavor/scent that we can smell in the wine. There are a lot of different flavors in this world, even within wine. So to make understanding them easier, they can be broken down into 4 major categories: fruit, oak, earth, and the catchall ‘other.’\nWhen you taste & smell wine you should try and identify any flavors (or lack thereof) from each of these categories. Every wine has some element of fruit in it. Some of these fruits are out there and more exotic, whilst others are a lot more familiar and closer to home.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:9e75b67f-6e14-4632-a2d7-b5a463d362e0>']}, {'passage': 'Wine is meant to have a partner. Food. As the two enter their union, the full flavors of both the wine and food stretch throughout all of the lovely layers and deepen the satiation and satisfaction of the dining experience. When I am in Bend, I look to our local grocer Newport Market to help me pick out my wine and trust the wine buyers there to not only recommend but share what they love about a particular wine. If I am picking out a wine to pair with a dish I have never made, I look no further than Suzi who has always steered me in delicious directions. From pairing with seafood to trout to lamb to paella, she suggests varying price points and leaves me to decide. Perhaps that is the key as well, know who to ask and who to trust for recommendations. For nine years when I lived near Walla Walla, Washington’s nearly 100 wineries, I trusted my own palate as we would visit the tasting rooms, often without a fee (and if there was a fee, it was $5 that could go toward your wine purchase), but that option is not available unless I travel now that I live in central Oregon – which perhaps is yet another reason to travel. 🙂\nHowever, to stick to hard-and-fast rules about what wine should go with what, while something to consider and inquire as to why, shouldn’t be adhered to absolutely nor blindly. Drink what you like, like what you drink was often a motto I would hear and for the most part, agree with. What I would add would be to just remember to pair it with food you enjoy as well. The entire flavor profile of the wine and the food when partnered, as mentioned above, changes, and often those traditional pairing suggestions reveal their wisdom. From something as simple as a luscious red cabernet-blend paired with a hamburger nestled between a brioche bun to a bouillabaisse paired with a light, crisp sauvignon blanc or viognier, if there is food, there is a wine that will pair with it and the experience will be all the more scrumptious and memorable because of it.

It’s just unbelievably rich, and weighty, like taking a big gulp of whole milk — or even chocolate milk — and it’s totally hedonistic and delicious.”\nLike acidity, sweetness is a taste that can be perceived by the tongue. Sweetness can be balanced by other components in the wine, particularly acid and tannin, so sweetness can be cloying or help smooth out the wine, depending on the overall balance.

We believe it's fairly common knowledge that red wines go well with red meat and, on the flip side, it's common for white wines to be paired with lighter meats, especially fish. And while grabbing any wine willy nilly is likely to enhance your dining experience, we think you'll find the art of intentional pairing to be quite rewarding. It certainly causes us to be more present in the dining moment, and remain more conscious of the flavor profiles for the entire meal. We thought some of you may not be convinced right off the bat so we decided to bring science and some beginner tips to the table to get you started. First, off, why red with red and white with white? Red wines tend to be heavier in body and more robust in taste than white wine. The same can be said about red and white meat. Thus, if you were to pair red wine with tilapia, there's a good chance you'll see the flavors of the tilapia overpowered and wiped out by the red wine. It doesn't get much more complicated than that, at least at the early beginners level. If you're already on board with the red-red/white-white concept, then here are some additional tips and pairings that may interest you. The GOLDEN RULE: Taste is Subjective\nAlways remember what you taste is personal. If a combination pleases you then it is a good choice. Focus on the Dominant Flavors\nWhile we just took up your time going on and on about pairing with meats, it's important to remember that the meat may not always be the dominant flavor of the dish. Did you make a crazy good, crazy flavorful sauce to go with it? There's your pairing target! When in Doubt, Pinot Noir\nPinot Noir is notorious for having a light-medium body. It's sort of in the middle on the whole spectrum which helps it go with many foods. More Sweet, More Acidic\nThis one is a simple and generic, but highly effective trick that's likely to take your pairing ability and experience to the next level. The wine should [almost] always be more acidic and sweeter than the food. Spice High, Alcohol Content Low\nAlcohol amplifies the oils that make spicy food hot. Stick to wines that are low in alcohol, such as off-dry German Rieslings. Smoke with Oak\nOaked wines are often more intense, and therefore they can overwhelm the flavors in a dish. By pairing them with foods that match that intensity, you'll find the strong oak notes suddenly tamed and the fruit flavors of the wine will be brought out instead. All the Things\nFinally, here's a nice all-around reference to help you figure this all out. As a reminder though, the most important rule is to do what you like and have fun. Cheers!"", 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:4b634eaa-a56c-4862-a942-9b9d74bf4a5c>']}, {'passage': 'A simple approach to wine buying is to match the acidity of the wine with the acidity of the dish. That’s because you don’t want the acidity of the food to overpower the wine. Both white and red wines (depending on the darkness of the skins) can be acidic depending on how they were made (like being aged in an oak barrel versus a steel barrel). Some foods, like chicken and pork, can go with either white or red wine depending on how they’re prepared. Generally, I suggest a white wine for either, and maybe a rosé (often midway in its acidity – thus one of my favorite food wine pairs) or light red, depending on the overall flavor. As for red wines, the skins and seeds included in the pressing and fermentation release even more tannic acids and alcohols into the wines – creating the flavor and color. Remember that with red wines, the lighter the wine color, the lower the tannins. That’s what creates the spectrum, varying levels of tannins. Fatty foods like steak require heavy-tannin reds like cabernets and merlots. Meanwhile, light to moderate fatty foods like salmon or pork can pair well with a light red like a pinot or Chianti. Finally, there’s one more rule for simple pairing… Pair spice with sweet. Sweeter wines, especially whites like riesling, tend to pair better with spicier foods like Thai and Mexican. That’s because sweeter wines help coat your burning tongue (from the spiciness) with sugars. Keep in mind, lower alcohol wines, like riesling and moscato, are also gentler on your palate as you enjoy spicy foods. These are my basic rules for wine pairing:\n- Focus on your taste and what you imagine it tastes like. - Make a guess as to how many tannins are in the wine. Weigh that against how heavy and acidic your food is… lemon mango salsa grilled tuna needs a bright acidic white wine with texture and body. A heavy rib eye with gravy and potatoes needs a dark and perhaps oaked red wine. And in between, say turkey or ham deserves a heavier white wine, a crisp rosé or lighter red. - Pair spicy with sweet. To make it even easier, here’s a list I put together for the most common food and wine pairings…\n- Fish: White\n- Pork: Rosé or white\n- Chicken: White or light red\n- Beef: Red\n- Pasta: Light red, though richer pasta dishes need acidic and ageable red wines\nKeep in mind, these are general rules based on food chemistry. You may find varieties of wines that go better with your meal but appear to break these rules. An old classmate of mine from graduate school at Kellogg once wrote to tell me he’d just had my Eifrig Cabernet Sauvignon with grilled swordfish on the beach. I loved it… it’s easy to see how my reds could balance the meatier texture of swordfish. And the oil and richness of the fish was complemented by the perfectly balanced acids and heavier tannins of my cabernet. Remember… The best part of learning about wine is trying and discovering what you like! The most important thing is that the value of wine tasting lies with you, the individual taster. Spending hundreds of dollars on a “good” bottle of wine doesn’t mean you’ll enjoy it (unless it’s mine of course). The best way to experience new wines pre-coronavirus was to stop by a local wine store for free tastings – often done several times a month. In some places and states, they might still be doing this… just call the store or check its website to see when it offers an event. It’s a great way to sample wine for free and get closer to finding your ideal wine. Likewise, when I’m dining out, I always ask the wait staff what they’d recommend with my dish and then ask them to get me a sip of a couple ideas before I pick what I want.

                ""text"": ""Last week we asked our fans on Facebook if they had a question for Executive Chef Justin Wangler. The response was great, and we got questions about food and wine pairings, best techniques in the kitchen, and favorite recipes. Chef Justin personally read each question and was quick to respond. But because there were so many questions, we thought it\u2019d be best to compile them here to be a resource for our community. If you have any more questions, let us know on Facebook and Twitter, or below in the comments. Cheers. 1. Chef Justin, my favorite varietal is Riesling (on the sweet side). Usually, I have the urge of drinking it with any and every dish possible. Do you recommend against it? What should I REALLY be drinking it with? Thanks! \u2013Daniella G\nIf you like Riesling, keep rocking it. Riesling is a great food wine and often lends itself to the dish. I really enjoy the K-J Riesling with spicy food and slightly sweet dishes. It\u2019s always fun to mix it up and try new things. The great thing about wine is there is always more to learn and taste. 2. Chef, which wine do you recommend for a big BBQ beef brisket sandwich? \u2013Larry H.\nI would enjoy some fine brisket with a Syrah or Zinfandel. The both have some nice fruit but also a bit of tannins to hold up to the rich, smoky brisket. 3. What is your favorite dish for the holiday family dinner? And what wine would you serve with it? \u2013Lorraine A\n4. Is there a kind of wine that is best for gift giving? One that is perhaps more popular than others, \u2013Marianne C\nI like to give Pinot Noir as a gift because it\u2019s very popular, and also lends itself well to lots of different foods. 5. What is your favorite ingredient to use from the K-J garden? \u2013Jessica R\nMy favorite ingredients vary from season to season. This time of year we really enjoy using Fuyu persimmons; we like to call it the \u201cwinter tomato.\u201d I really like Fuyu persimmons raw & sliced in salads. Overall, my favorite thing is to watch the asparagus grow in the garden. Check out our time lapse video of asparagus growing. 6. What\u2019s your favorite dish to make for your family? \u2013Meredith H\nAt home in Sonoma county I like to cook wild local salmon when in season. If I sear the salmon I usually serve it with K-J Grand Reserve Chardonnay and if I throw it on the grill and get a bit of smoke on it I like to pair with the K-J Vintners Reserve Pinot Noir. My wife and daughter also love the fatty salmon belly brushed with Meyer lemon olive oil sprinkled with salt and roasted at a low temp in the oven until just cooked. 7. I am always searching for a good wine. I like reds and whites, nothing too sweet or too dry. The best way for me to describe it is smooth, buttery & creamy very little or no bite. I steer clear of anything that sounds like it might have too much oak taste. Any suggestions? \u2013Carol H.\nIt\u2019s sounds like you are describing our Grand Reserve Chardonnay. It has great fruit, light on the oak and a wonderful round, rich texture. 8. What\u2019s the hardest dish/food to combine with wine? \u2013Marine R\nExtremely spicy foods can be tricky (for example,Trinidad Scorpion Morouga peppers \u2014 there are some funny videos online!). Artichokes are a notoriously tricky one because they can make whatever you eat or drink afterwards taste sweet, but they can be quite good when paired with the right wine. It\u2019s fun to play around tasting artichokes with different wines, such as a crisp wine like Sauvignon Blanc, a rich Chardonnay or maybe even an off-dry wine that has it\u2019s own sweetness. 9. Chef, is there an easy way to cut the slices from an orange without getting any membrane and ruining most of the slice? \u2013John B\nSegmenting an orange is a simple process, but it\u2019s a little tough to explain. Here\u2019s a great video I found from Fine Cooking on YouTube."",

                ""text"": ""The last thing one needs to hear when trying out wine in a local - read Asian - context is to match red meat with red wines and white meat with white wines. After all, most of us are familiar with the tremendous amount of complexity in Asian fare, such that a typical white meat such as fish can involve such different flavours that it might be better off paired with a light red. Yet how does one make a choice, given the vast array of choices available when speaking of Asian food? Although not the last word on the subject, this article aims to provide some rough guidelines of matching local food with wine. Some rough rules of thumb, based on the following (broad) classifications of wines:\nDry tart reds go well with strong meats (beef steak, lamb - syrah and lamb, yum). I am thinking here of most Indian dishes (which feature lamb) and many Thai dishes (which feature beef). Stir fried beef, however, might go well with lighter, fruiter reds as well. For the Chinese-style stir-fried mushrooms, I find that the generally lighter body of Pinots go well with the flavours there. I would pair dry tart whites with most seafood (and also Chinese style stir-fry). In fact, if going out for a Chiense-style dinner, I would more often than not grab a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc, as it seems to be the most versatile wine for the large spread of dishes in a typical Chinese meal. Dry fruity reds, other than with beef stir-fry, could be paired with lighter meats (chicken, even maybe salmon, as well as cheese). I find that sauces and gravies from most Asian dishes would overwhelm the delicate flavour of a light fruity red, with the exception of the Merlot. I would tag this final wine with dishes from a more Malay setting, perhaps even Indonesia food. Dry fruity whites go well with fish, in general. I have also enjoyed it with seafood, although the possibly spicy nature of most Asian seafood makes crisp whites a better match. Steamed fish, or drunken prawns, I would imagine, would be well complemented by fruity whites. I would have light sweets alone (or with ice cream and not-so-sweet desserts - eg. apple strudel and lighter, fluffier cheesecakes - say, Fiesta), although I once had a slightly sweet white with crayfish, and it was quite an unforgettable experience. For that matter, the more adventurous might want to try non-spicy seafoods with a slightly sweet wine. For sweets, they usually go best with sweet desserts, especially sweeter cakes (i think of Tiramisu and New York cheesecake). Local desserts like chendol would also go well, since neither would overpower the other. Try Tokaji with Durian ice-cream - a friend swears by it. Some other pointers:\nGewurtztraminer & Co.: Wine books used to dismiss the whole question by recommending this one wine as the only match for Asian dishes. This is misleading - and possibly even plain wrong for some dishes. This arose from the fact that \""Gewurz\"" means \""spicy\"" in German, many tended to assume that spicy food would go well with Gewurtztraminer. Although the actual wine is more reminiscent of tropical fruit than tropical fare, it actually doesn't go too badly with Asian seafood. This arises because gewurztraminers are often off dry, and this makes them a decent choice with Asian dishes that have sweet or fruity flavors. For the same reason, Riesling - also typically made off-dry - can be good companions with your sweet and sour pork or chilli crab. Sparking Wine: It might surprise many that champagne actually marries well with a wide range of Asian food, especially if the food is spicy, since the bubbles tend to quench a little of that spicy heat. I can imagine some of the cheaper sparking wines, especially from Spain (Cava) or sparkling wines not from the Champagne region (say, Cremants from Loire). The analogy here is to imagine an almost ice-cold bubbly going down with the spice, somewhat like how a beer neutralises many of the sharp tangs in chilli. East Meets West: Even with exotic fare, the old \""red with red\"" rule often works."",

                ""text"": ""What is the best wine to pair with your meal? The old adage \u201cred wine with meat, white wine with fish\u201d is a good rule of thumb. Pairing is about matching the main components of a dish and the main components of the wine. However, that does not always mean complementing. Sometimes, a contrasting style is ideal. But, in general, think about the main dish\u2019s dominant flavor, its character, intensity and the comparative level of its fats to acids. Then find a wine whose style will best showcase that dish. However, not all meals need to be paired perfectly, although I enjoy when I have a meal where the wine matches up perfectly with the food, more often than not, I just pour myself a glass of wine that I want, and have it along with my meal, whether or not it falls within \u201cthe rules\u201d of pairing. For most of us, most of the time, when we are eating a meal that we like and drinking a wine that we love, our enjoyment of both the wine and food will be good. Below are some tips for Wine and Food Pairing:\nThe wine should be more acidic than the food. The wine should be sweeter than the food. The wine should have the same flavor intensity as the food. Red wines pair best with bold flavored meats (e.g. red meat). White wines pair best with light-intensity meats (e.g. fish or chicken). Bitter wines (e.g. red wines) are best balanced with fat. It is better to match the wine with the sauce than with the meat. More often than not, White, Sparkling and Ros\u00e9 wines create contrasting pairings. More often than not, Red wines will create congruent pairings. Some classic wine and food pairings:\n1. Sauvignon Blanc and Oysters\n2. Chardonnay and Lobster\n3. Sparkling Wine or Pinot Grigio and chips\n4. Sparkling Wine and Fried Chicken\n5. Spicy Foods and Riesling\n6. Pinot Noir and Rosted Pork\n7. Spaghetti and Chianti\n8. BBQ Chicken and Zinfandel\n9. Burgers and Merlot or a Red Blend\n10. Spice Rubbed Brisket and Syrah\n11. Cabernet and Steak\nBottom line is, drink what you want, with what you want. However, you will find that when the food and wine are paired properly, it can elevate the enjoyment of your entire meal. Do you have a meal that you have paired with a wine from Vino Mas, send us a picture, the recipe if you would like, we would love to share it with others!"",

This list explores the top five bluegrass influences on today’s music scene. The genre of bluegrass was created in the southern Appalachian region of the United States. From its beginning, many genres have been influenced by it. The following are notable influences that are listened to today:
1) Alternative rock – Some bands with alternative rock roots include Nickel Creek, Widespread Panic, State Radio and Old Crow Medicine Show. Each one of these bands carries the sound of bluegrass in their music. Nickel Creek, specifically, has a lot of folk elements in its songs. 2) Country – The country band Little Big Town got its start in the bluegrass genre. Although they have changed their style to fit mainstream audiences, they still retain some traditional bluegrass sounds in their popular songs. Other notable country artists include Dierks Bentley, Keith Urban and Sara Evans. 3) Folk – The folk band Crooked Still draws its inspiration from bluegrass and old time music. They have released several albums including 2008’s “Shaken by a Low Sound” and 2011’s “Tomorrow Is Going to Be a Brighter Day.” They are very popular in the folk music scene. 4) Pop/R&B – The pop band Nickel Creek has incorporated bluegrass sounds into its albums for quite some time; their album “A Dotted Line” was released in 2014 and has many of those elements. Another well known bluegrass pop group is the Avett Brothers. They have incorporated bluegrass sounds into their folk-rock music. 5) Hip hop – Recently, several artists have found themselves incorporating bluegrass into hip hop beats and instrumentals.

Music comes in many different forms and not all of them are equally popular. Maybe you are into a specific type of music and maybe you like 1 or 2 genres more, but the thing is, most people prefer just one genre. This can be useful to new musicians, due to the fact they can start their career in the music genre that is most popular. This would definitely make the things easier. You may believe that POP music is the #1 in the world, but it isn’t. Now you will see the most popular music genres in the world. - Heavy Metal
Once treated as outcasts, the musicians of this genre are today the number one when it comes to the music popularity. They have the most fans across the planet, but in the United States, this number is even higher. Heavy Metal started its life back in the 60s, as a sub-genre of rock. Some of the best-known names in this genre are Metallica and Iron Maiden. Fans of this type of music are completely into it and their lifestyle is even based on Heavy Metal. - Rock n’ Roll
Rock n’ Roll has been one of the most popular music genres since the day it was invented. Let’s just say that the first traces of this music come from the 50s, but the popularity was significantly increased during the 70s and 80s. ACDC, G N R and many others have made this genre the ultimate choice for most people. This music is commonly produced by a drummer, a singer, bass player and a guitar player. - Alternative music
This music genre has no description, nor it can be described actually, simply because it is based on art. We all know that art cannot be defined. Linkin Park, Evanescence and many others made this music extremely popular and extremely desirable. You will need drummer, vocals and a guitar and you are good to go. This is also the hardest music genre to dominate. - Hard Rock
This genre isn’t the same as heavy metal or just rock. It is completely different in a matter of fact and it has a lot to offer. Rush, Led Zeppelin and literally, dozens of other bands made this genre the ultimate one if you want to enjoy the music, but at the same time, you want to listen to the beautiful words, great bass and to dance like you have never before. Classical music is still one of the most popular music genres ever. It is completely different than anything else and it is more than just beneficial to listen. Just relax in one of the best massage chairs, turn on the music and relax. First and foremost, this music is always produced by some of the biggest and the best musicians ever known. Mozart, Beethoven, and literally many others have shaped the classical music according to their beliefs. Now, we can simply enjoy that literally forever. And yes, this music is also known for increasing the IQ. Rap has been the most popular type of music in ghettoes, and in groups where people wanted to express themselves in an interesting and original way. This music may be the only kind that can make you laugh and cry at the same time. Since the time it has been first noticed, till now, it has made a significant improvement. Some of the biggest names here are Eminem, Tupac, Nas, Big L and etc. How many of you listen to the jazz music? Probably all of you have listened to it at least a few times in your life. The reason why is very simple. This is a gentle, sensitive music that is rich in feelings and always makes you think about something or someone. All artists from this genre are very popular and there are high chances this is going to be similar to the classical music in the near future. Frank Sinatra, Louis Armstrong, and many others have been responsible for some of the best songs ever. In addition, jazz originated from New Orleans and it has been made by slaves back in a day! - Electronic music
Commonly known as dance music, or electronic dance music (EDM), is one of those genres that has to be on every list. It has been among us since the 80s, but in the 90s it got very desirable. The place of origin is Europe, but since 2000 electronic music has been introduced in the United States. Nowadays, it is the most common choice for crazy parties and nightclubs where people simply want to relax and dance. Here, words and vocals are not present. On the other side, thebass is something that has an important part. Pop music isn’t the most popular, as you can see, but the highest number of people talk about it every day.

Musicologists have sometimes classified music according to a trichotomic distinction such as Philip Tagg's ""axiomatic triangle consisting of'folk','art' and'popular' musics"", he explains that each of these three is distinguishable from the others according to certain criteria. The term art music refers to classical traditions, including both contemporary and historical classical music forms. Art music exists in many parts of the world, it emphasizes formal styles that invite technical and detailed deconstruction and criticism, demand focused attention from the listener. In Western practice, art music is considered a written musical tradition, preserved in some form of music notation rather than being transmitted orally, by rote, or in recordings, as popular and traditional music are. Most western art music has been written down using the standard forms of music notation that evolved in Europe, beginning well before the Renaissance and reaching its maturity in the Romantic period. The identity of a ""work"" or ""piece"" of art music is defined by the notated version rather than by a particular performance, is associated with the composer rather than the performer. This is so in the case of western classical music. Art music may include certain forms of jazz, though some feel that jazz is a form of popular music. Sacred Christian music forms an important part of the classical music tradition and repertoire, but can be considered to have an identity of its own; the term popular music refers to any musical style accessible to the general public and disseminated by the mass media. Musicologist and popular music specialist Philip Tagg defined the notion in the light of sociocultural and economical aspects: Popular music, unlike art music, is conceived for mass distribution to large and socioculturally heterogeneous groups of listeners and distributed in non-written form, only possible in an industrial monetary economy where it becomes a commodity and in capitalist societies, subject to the laws of'free' enterprise... it should ideally sell as much as possible. Popular music is found on most commercial and public service radio stations, in most commercial music retailers and department stores, in movie and television soundtracks. It is noted on the Billboard charts and, in addition to singer-songwriters and composers, it involves music producers more than other genres do; the distinction between classical and popular music has sometimes been blurred in marginal areas such as minimalist music and light classics. Background music for films/movies draws on both traditions. In this respect, music is like fiction, which draws a distinction between literary fiction and popular fiction, not always precise. Country music known as country and western, hillbilly music, is a genre of popular music that originated in the southern United States in the early 1920s; the polka is a Czech dance and genre of dance music familiar throughout Europe and the Americas. Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as ""rock and roll"" in the United States in the early 1950s, developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and particular
A drum kit — called a drum set, trap set, or drums — is a collection of drums and other percussion instruments cymbals, which are set up on stands to be played by a single player, with drumsticks held in both hands, the feet operating pedals that control the hi-hat cymbal and the beater for the bass drum. A drum kit consists of a mix of drums and idiophones – most cymbals, but can include the woodblock and cowbell. In the 2000s, some kits include electronic instruments. Both hybrid and electronic kits are used. A standard modern kit, as used in popular music and taught in music schools, contains: A snare drum, mounted on a stand, placed between the player's knees and played with drum sticks A bass drum, played by a pedal operated by the right foot, which moves a felt-covered beater One or more toms, played with sticks or brushes A hi-hat, played with the sticks and closed with left foot pedal One or more cymbals, mounted on stands, played with the sticksAll of these are classified as non-pitched percussion, allowing the music to be scored using percussion notation, for which a loose semi-standardized form exists for both the drum kit and electronic drums. The drum kit is played while seated on a stool known as a throne.

Many students learning English have learned how to talk about their favorite songs and music genres, but don’t know much beyond describing what band they like or a broad description of the type of music they’re interested in. So, let’s take your English to the next level with some native-like ways to describe your musical interests. Try describing your favorite music genre more specifically with sub-genres. While it’s commonly known that there are many genres of music from pop to country, sub-genres are sub-categories within these genres that specify exactly what kind of music you’re talking about. Here are just a few examples but you can easily search online for more. New Wave Pop
Lofi Hip Hop
Using the time of the music’s release can help narrow down your musical interest. This is especially useful with genres like pop that can vary greatly from year to year. The type of music released by artists can also change a lot over time, so you can use different points in the career of a band or singer to describe the style of music you like. Here are some examples in sentences. I like listening to 80’s pop. I’m a big fan of early 2000’s alternative rock. Motown from the late 60’s was incredible. The early works of that band are the best. The mood and aesthetic of certain bands become a unique part of the listening experience. Some songs released by even the same artist can sound completely different from each other. Additionally, the aesthetic, or artistic image of a band can sometimes be just as important as the music. In fact, some aesthetics are so intertwined with the music, they merge to create their own sub-genre, like gothic rock. Here are some words to describe mood and aesthetic. Popularity plays a lot into describing music. For example, an important feature of enjoying pop music may be about what’s on top of the charts at the time. On the other hand, many rock music lovers prefer their favorite artists before they become popular. Here are some ways to describe the popularity of your favorite music. Many of these expressions can also be used when talking about movies, books, video games, and other interests. whatever– expresses openness to acceptance
I usually like whatever’s on the radio. trending– currently popular
This group is trending online. indie– independent; not belonging to a major company
I love this indie band. You probably haven’t heard of them. sell out– become too popular to be relatable
I used to like that singer before they sold out. These are just a few examples of words and phrases to describe music, but there is much more available. Keep in mind that sub-genres, popularity, and other aspects of music help describe your musical interests more specifically. Combine these tips and describe your musical tastes like a native speaker with ease.","[{'passage': 'Bluegrass is one of the most diverse genres in the world of music. Bluegrass has influenced many different styles including rock, country, pop and even hip-hop! This list explores the top five bluegrass influences on today’s music scene. The genre of bluegrass was created in the southern Appalachian region of the United States. From its beginning, many genres have been influenced by it. The following are notable influences that are listened to today:\n1) Alternative rock – Some bands with alternative rock roots include Nickel Creek, Widespread Panic, State Radio and Old Crow Medicine Show. Each one of these bands carries the sound of bluegrass in their music. Nickel Creek, specifically, has a lot of folk elements in its songs. 2) Country – The country band Little Big Town got its start in the bluegrass genre. Although they have changed their style to fit mainstream audiences, they still retain some traditional bluegrass sounds in their popular songs. Other notable country artists include Dierks Bentley, Keith Urban and Sara Evans. 3) Folk – The folk band Crooked Still draws its inspiration from bluegrass and old time music. They have released several albums including 2008’s “Shaken by a Low Sound” and 2011’s “Tomorrow Is Going to Be a Brighter Day.” They are very popular in the folk music scene. 4) Pop/R&B – The pop band Nickel Creek has incorporated bluegrass sounds into its albums for quite some time; their album “A Dotted Line” was released in 2014 and has many of those elements. Another well known bluegrass pop group is the Avett Brothers. They have incorporated bluegrass sounds into their folk-rock music. 5) Hip hop – Recently, several artists have found themselves incorporating bluegrass into hip hop beats and instrumentals. Artists who do this include Jim James of My Morning Jacket, Big Krit and Wiz Khalifa. Each artist brings different elements of bluegrass to their songs. Bluegrass has influenced many different aspects of today’s music scene and continues to be a growing musical genre in the world of music.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:3544afbb-39f7-4c0d-8070-f2e378729642>']}, {'passage': ""Every man today fits under at least one classification of music essays related to music classifications 1 the classification of film, genre also.

Maybe you are into a specific type of music and maybe you like 1 or 2 genres more, but the thing is, most people prefer just one genre. This can be useful to new musicians, due to the fact they can start their career in the music genre that is most popular. This would definitely make the things easier. You may believe that POP music is the #1 in the world, but it isn’t. Now you will see the most popular music genres in the world. - Heavy Metal\nOnce treated as outcasts, the musicians of this genre are today the number one when it comes to the music popularity. They have the most fans across the planet, but in the United States, this number is even higher. Heavy Metal started its life back in the 60s, as a sub-genre of rock. Some of the best-known names in this genre are Metallica and Iron Maiden. Fans of this type of music are completely into it and their lifestyle is even based on Heavy Metal. - Rock n’ Roll\nRock n’ Roll has been one of the most popular music genres since the day it was invented.

ACDC, G N R and many others have made this genre the ultimate choice for most people. This music is commonly produced by a drummer, a singer, bass player and a guitar player. - Alternative music\nThis music genre has no description, nor it can be described actually, simply because it is based on art. We all know that art cannot be defined. Linkin Park, Evanescence and many others made this music extremely popular and extremely desirable. You will need drummer, vocals and a guitar and you are good to go. This is also the hardest music genre to dominate. - Hard Rock\nThis genre isn’t the same as heavy metal or just rock. It is completely different in a matter of fact and it has a lot to offer. Rush, Led Zeppelin and literally, dozens of other bands made this genre the ultimate one if you want to enjoy the music, but at the same time, you want to listen to the beautiful words, great bass and to dance like you have never before. Classical music is still one of the most popular music genres ever. It is completely different than anything else and it is more than just beneficial to listen. Just relax in one of the best massage chairs, turn on the music and relax. First and foremost, this music is always produced by some of the biggest and the best musicians ever known. Mozart, Beethoven, and literally many others have shaped the classical music according to their beliefs. Now, we can simply enjoy that literally forever.

Rap has been the most popular type of music in ghettoes, and in groups where people wanted to express themselves in an interesting and original way.

Some of the biggest names here are Eminem, Tupac, Nas, Big L and etc. How many of you listen to the jazz music? Probably all of you have listened to it at least a few times in your life. The reason why is very simple. This is a gentle, sensitive music that is rich in feelings and always makes you think about something or someone. All artists from this genre are very popular and there are high chances this is going to be similar to the classical music in the near future. Frank Sinatra, Louis Armstrong, and many others have been responsible for some of the best songs ever.

The term art music refers to classical traditions, including both contemporary and historical classical music forms. Art music exists in many parts of the world, it emphasizes formal styles that invite technical and detailed deconstruction and criticism, demand focused attention from the listener. In Western practice, art music is considered a written musical tradition, preserved in some form of music notation rather than being transmitted orally, by rote, or in recordings, as popular and traditional music are. Most western art music has been written down using the standard forms of music notation that evolved in Europe, beginning well before the Renaissance and reaching its maturity in the Romantic period. The identity of a ""work"" or ""piece"" of art music is defined by the notated version rather than by a particular performance, is associated with the composer rather than the performer. This is so in the case of western classical music. Art music may include certain forms of jazz, though some feel that jazz is a form of popular music. Sacred Christian music forms an important part of the classical music tradition and repertoire, but can be considered to have an identity of its own; the term popular music refers to any musical style accessible to the general public and disseminated by the mass media. Musicologist and popular music specialist Philip Tagg defined the notion in the light of sociocultural and economical aspects: Popular music, unlike art music, is conceived for mass distribution to large and socioculturally heterogeneous groups of listeners and distributed in non-written form, only possible in an industrial monetary economy where it becomes a commodity and in capitalist societies, subject to the laws of\'free\' enterprise... it should ideally sell as much as possible. Popular music is found on most commercial and public service radio stations, in most commercial music retailers and department stores, in movie and television soundtracks. It is noted on the Billboard charts and, in addition to singer-songwriters and composers, it involves music producers more than other genres do; the distinction between classical and popular music has sometimes been blurred in marginal areas such as minimalist music and light classics. Background music for films/movies draws on both traditions. In this respect, music is like fiction, which draws a distinction between literary fiction and popular fiction, not always precise. Country music known as country and western, hillbilly music, is a genre of popular music that originated in the southern United States in the early 1920s; the polka is a Czech dance and genre of dance music familiar throughout Europe and the Americas. Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as ""rock and roll"" in the United States in the early 1950s, developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and particular\nA drum kit — called a drum set, trap set, or drums — is a collection of drums and other percussion instruments cymbals, which are set up on stands to be played by a single player, with drumsticks held in both hands, the feet operating pedals that control the hi-hat cymbal and the beater for the bass drum. A drum kit consists of a mix of drums and idiophones – most cymbals, but can include the woodblock and cowbell. In the 2000s, some kits include electronic instruments. Both hybrid and electronic kits are used. A standard modern kit, as used in popular music and taught in music schools, contains: A snare drum, mounted on a stand, placed between the player\'s knees and played with drum sticks A bass drum, played by a pedal operated by the right foot, which moves a felt-covered beater One or more toms, played with sticks or brushes A hi-hat, played with the sticks and closed with left foot pedal One or more cymbals, mounted on stands, played with the sticksAll of these are classified as non-pitched percussion, allowing the music to be scored using percussion notation, for which a loose semi-standardized form exists for both the drum kit and electronic drums.

So, let’s take your English to the next level with some native-like ways to describe your musical interests. Try describing your favorite music genre more specifically with sub-genres. While it’s commonly known that there are many genres of music from pop to country, sub-genres are sub-categories within these genres that specify exactly what kind of music you’re talking about. Here are just a few examples but you can easily search online for more. New Wave Pop\nLofi Hip Hop\nUsing the time of the music’s release can help narrow down your musical interest. This is especially useful with genres like pop that can vary greatly from year to year. The type of music released by artists can also change a lot over time, so you can use different points in the career of a band or singer to describe the style of music you like. Here are some examples in sentences. I like listening to 80’s pop. I’m a big fan of early 2000’s alternative rock. Motown from the late 60’s was incredible. The early works of that band are the best. The mood and aesthetic of certain bands become a unique part of the listening experience. Some songs released by even the same artist can sound completely different from each other. Additionally, the aesthetic, or artistic image of a band can sometimes be just as important as the music. In fact, some aesthetics are so intertwined with the music, they merge to create their own sub-genre, like gothic rock. Here are some words to describe mood and aesthetic. Popularity plays a lot into describing music. For example, an important feature of enjoying pop music may be about what’s on top of the charts at the time. On the other hand, many rock music lovers prefer their favorite artists before they become popular. Here are some ways to describe the popularity of your favorite music. Many of these expressions can also be used when talking about movies, books, video games, and other interests. whatever– expresses openness to acceptance\nI usually like whatever’s on the radio. trending– currently popular\nThis group is trending online. indie– independent; not belonging to a major company\nI love this indie band. You probably haven’t heard of them. sell out– become too popular to be relatable\nI used to like that singer before they sold out. These are just a few examples of words and phrases to describe music, but there is much more available. Keep in mind that sub-genres, popularity, and other aspects of music help describe your musical interests more specifically. Combine these tips and describe your musical tastes like a native speaker with ease.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:01af8715-cb18-459c-8f20-ce26682c3249>']}]","{

                ""text"": ""The last time I listened to Nickel Creek was to analyze their adaptation of Robert Burns\u2019 poem, \u201cSweet Afton,\u201d in my English literature class in college three years ago. Indeed, the waters of Nickel Creek flow gently, a trait reflected in \u201cSweet Afton\u201d and many other Nickel Creek staples. And that general lack of bite, paired with an almost robotic mastery of each band members\u2019 respective instrument, pushed me away from the band. So it was strange that, with no expectations and an arbitrarily negative perception of the classic folk band, I really enjoyed seeing Nickel Creek reunite in Washington, D.C. after a six-year hiatus. The show, in sum, was really, really good. I was sandwiched on the upper level between some high schoolers and a middle-aged man at the show with, presumably, his mom. Below us was a melting pot of folk music fans of all ages with one thing in common: they all love Nickel Creek. I didn\u2019t realize so many people could love Nickel Creek so strongly, and I was blown away by the energy and participation of the crowd. The band thrived on the raucous sing alongs of the crowd and seemed to feel like it almost owed them a great performance. Everyone in the building was having a good time. I went to see Punch Brothers last spring at the same venue (the 9:30 Club in D.C.) and was blown away by the musicianship of all of the band\u2019s members but especially its mandolin virtuoso and front man \u2014 Chris Thile \u2014 who also happens to be a member of Nickel Creek. The Nickel Creek performance followed suit, and each member provided stunning displays of technical mastery combined with emotional energy (usually fueled by the crowd), particularly on the instrumental tunes peppered throughout the set. The band played all of their hits (see their \u201cbest of\u201d album, Reasons Why: The Very Best) for what comprised most of their set list. They threw in a few nice new tunes like \u201cDestination\u201d and \u201cLove of Mine\u201d for good measure, but the crowd definitely enjoyed hearing some of the more popular songs like \u201cThe Lighthouse\u2019s Tale\u201d and \u201cWhen in Rome.\u201d\nAll in all, great show from a great band, and who knows how long they\u2019ll be on tour for in the future \u2014 fans had to wait six years up until a few months ago. Here\u2019s to hoping there\u2019s still more to come from an already prolific folk band. Brandon Hook is the Web and Multimedia Associtae at Sojourners."",

                ""text"": ""Bluegrass is one of the most diverse genres in the world of music. Bluegrass has influenced many different styles including rock, country, pop and even hip-hop! This list explores the top five bluegrass influences on today\u2019s music scene. The genre of bluegrass was created in the southern Appalachian region of the United States. From its beginning, many genres have been influenced by it. The following are notable influences that are listened to today:\n1) Alternative rock \u2013 Some bands with alternative rock roots include Nickel Creek, Widespread Panic, State Radio and Old Crow Medicine Show. Each one of these bands carries the sound of bluegrass in their music. Nickel Creek, specifically, has a lot of folk elements in its songs. 2) Country \u2013 The country band Little Big Town got its start in the bluegrass genre. Although they have changed their style to fit mainstream audiences, they still retain some traditional bluegrass sounds in their popular songs. Other notable country artists include Dierks Bentley, Keith Urban and Sara Evans. 3) Folk \u2013 The folk band Crooked Still draws its inspiration from bluegrass and old time music. They have released several albums including 2008\u2019s \u201cShaken by a Low Sound\u201d and 2011\u2019s \u201cTomorrow Is Going to Be a Brighter Day.\u201d They are very popular in the folk music scene. 4) Pop/R&B \u2013 The pop band Nickel Creek has incorporated bluegrass sounds into its albums for quite some time; their album \u201cA Dotted Line\u201d was released in 2014 and has many of those elements.

They have incorporated bluegrass sounds into their folk-rock music. 5) Hip hop \u2013 Recently, several artists have found themselves incorporating bluegrass into hip hop beats and instrumentals. Artists who do this include Jim James of My Morning Jacket, Big Krit and Wiz Khalifa. Each artist brings different elements of bluegrass to their songs. Bluegrass has influenced many different aspects of today\u2019s music scene and continues to be a growing musical genre in the world of music."",

There is a tradition preceding (or paralleling) this aspect of Nickel Creek. Even Chris Thile's own effort, \""Not All Who Wander Are Lost\"" (2001) is pretty solid. Buy that one first. I liked Nickel Creek's first effort but 'This Side' blew me away. Every track on this CD is terrific. For anyone who loves acoustic music with outstanding vocals, this is a must hear. Their instrumental tracks are great, but 1 or 2 per album is enough for me. The four tracks on their debut release was a little too much. Great Job Nickel Creek! I LOVED their first CD, and was waiting to get my hands on this CD. At first, I was a little hesitant as I listned to the songs. But, when I listened to it the second time, I fell in love with it. It's different, which is good. I enjoyed the first album but I think this album ventured to far from the roots of bluegrass\nNickel Creek's sophomore album does not disappoint. The songs live up to the band's energetic and lively playing! Kudos to the band for going out on a limb and daring to be adventurous in their song choices and interpretations. The title track stands out as well as their rendition of Carrie Newcomer's \""I Should've Known Better.\"" We can only hope they will continue to sing and play for many more years! I was watching public television and saw their set...so young yet their sound is so captivating, I'm amazed at their ability to make such great music. After hearing them on TV, I had to buy the cd! folksie bluegrass diehards who obessed over the perfection of nickel creek's self-titled first release on sugar hill a few years back beware- you may be a bit angry not to find much bluegrass here. however, all the lame comments about nickel creek \""wandering too far from their roots\"" are ubsurd and unfounded! the band members are from SoCal people, not your bluegrass capital of the world! however, keep an open mind, go through the album SLOWLY and DEEPLY, and you will be just as impressed as the first go around! Smoothie Song- is the only instrumental but is great, they need a few more ones like this on the album to round it out; Spit on a Stranger- not really my thing, but has attracted some new listeners i'm sure; Speak- gorgeous song, a lot like Sean's solo album (check that out too btw); Hanging By a Thread- Chris's voice is kinda funky here, and kinda makes you hurt; I Should've Known Better- awesome, love this song; This Side- another great example of why Sean should sing a lot more, his writing skills are really amasing! ; Green and Grey- really cool lyrics here... great imagery so i'll give it the best lyrics of the album nod; Seven Wonders- kinda sleepy but sits well with Sara's voice; House Carpenter- long but good for the traditionalist's sake; Beauty and the Mess- Sara steps out of her shell here, it's an awesome song; Sabra Girl- great cover, could stand to be a bit more 'celtic'; Young- nice lyrics, pretty song; Brand New Song- really deep, Chris's growth since the last time is apparent here... on the whole- GIVE IT A CHANCE.. it, just like the last one, will grow on you... as allison krauss said \""it's just nickel creek music\""\nWhat Can I Say That Hasn't Already Been Said About Nickel Creek. Thile Has Developed As One Of The Most Talented Songwriters and Vocalists In Years. Great Vocal Debut By Sean Watkins on ''This Side'' and ''Speak''. Sara Shines As Well. Not What I Expected, But How Could I Expect An Album Of Such Unbridled Talent & Genius. Tracks: 1. Smoothie Song- Not A Sign Of What Is To Come, but a fierce Instrumental None the Less. 2. Spit On A Stranger- Like Nothing You've Heard Before. One of the album's distinctive highlights. 3. Speak-Good Song...Well Done, but not a signature track. 4."",

The negative effects also extend beyond just the homeowners to impact entire neighborhoods.","Losing a home can have significant negative impacts on your health beyond just the mental stress associated with the loss. Here are some ways in which losing a home can affect your health:

1. **Physical Health Consequences:** The stress of losing a home can lead to physical health problems such as high blood pressure, heart disease, and weakened immune system. This is because prolonged stress can cause the body to produce higher levels of stress hormones, which can negatively affect various bodily functions.

2. **Disrupted Routine:** Losing a home often means that you have to move to a new place, which can disrupt your daily routine. This disruption can lead to sleep disturbances, irregular eating patterns, and a lack of physical activity, all of which can contribute to poor health.

3. **Access to Resources:** Your home is often a source of access to healthcare, food, and other resources. Losing a home can mean losing access to these resources, which can lead to malnutrition, untreated health conditions, and a general decline in health.

4. **Social Isolation:** A home provides a sense of security and belonging. When you lose your home, you may also lose your sense of community and social support. Social isolation can lead to depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues, which in turn can impact physical health.

5. **Financial Strain:** The process of finding a new home and the associated costs can create significant financial strain. This financial stress can lead to further health problems, including stress-related illnesses, and may force individuals to make health-damaging choices, such as skipping medical treatments or medications due to cost.

6. **Increased Risk of Homelessness:** If you are unable to find a new home, the risk of homelessness increases, which is associated with a higher incidence of physical and mental health problems, including infectious diseases, chronic illnesses, and mental health disorders.

7. **Chronic Stress:** The constant worry and uncertainty that come with losing a home can lead to chronic stress. Over time, chronic stress can have profound effects on your physical and mental health, contributing to a range of health issues, including heart disease, diabetes, and depression.

In summary, losing a home can have far-reaching consequences on your health, affecting both your mental and physical well-being. It underscores the importance of housing stability as a fundamental component of overall health and well-being.","You are a helpful assistant.

### Context: This can make dealing with an existing mental illness more difficult, like feeling as though you’re backsliding in recovery. It could also show up as not being able to do as much as you used to pre-pandemic. “Many people who previously coped well, are now less able to cope because of the multiple stressors generated by the pandemic,” wrote The Lancet Commission on Global Mental Health and Sustainable Development, according to the United Nations. - Of more than 10,000 survey respondents in early April, 53% said their productivity levels were impacted because of their mental health while working at home
5. Increased Substance Use
Though it’s not the healthiest way to manage your mental health, it’s also not surprising that substance use has increased due to the pandemic. If you or a loved one is affected by addiction and need help, you can call SAMHSA’s hotline at 1-800-662-4357. - Approximately 20% of Canadians between the ages of 15 and 49 have been drinking more alcohol during the pandemic
- A COVID-19 survey found 25% of respondents reported binge drinking at least once in the past week. One out of five said they used prescription drugs for non-prescription reasons and one out of seven used illicit drugs
6. Parenting Is Hard
All memes and good fun aside, the truth underlying those hilarious parenting memes is that parenting right now is hard. With schools closed, parents have taken on a much more intensive role in their child’s day-to-day life, all while being stuck at home more than ever. It’s a lot, and it’s taking its toll. - 20% of parents with children were struggling with their mental health, compared to 13% of those without young kids in the house
- 31% of women with children working full-time felt they had more on their plate than they could handle compared to 13% of men
- Women are spending 7.4 more hours per week on childcare than men, Latinx and Black women spend 4 to 12 hours more each week than white women and single mothers another 7 hours more than women overall
7. Work Is Hard
There’s no question losing your job because of the COVID-19 pandemic is devastating. So far, 36.5 million Americans have filed for unemployment. The economic uncertainty and very real consequences — like fear of losing your home or not being able to feed your family — impact mental health. But it turns out even if you’re working from home, it can have a negative impact on your mental health. - 18% of Americans who were still working as of April 15 were actually more likely to say they were experiencing negative emotional effects compared to 12% of those not working
- 45% of employees said they were burned out — and 25% said it was due to COVID-19
- The top reasons for work-related burnout during COVID-19 included: 26.7% due to no home-work life balance, 20.5% because of an unmanageable workload and 18.8% because of job security concerns
- Only 52% of employees working from home said their employer was more flexible because of the pandemic while only 31% said a manager or human resources staff member checked on their well-being
8. Worried About Mental vs. Physical Health
Some experts have called the mental health impact of COVID-19 a second wave of the pandemic, and the numbers don’t lie. For many people, the mental health consequences of COVID-19 — and everything that comes with it — is a bigger stressor than their physical health. - In mid-April, 15% of Gallup survey participants said their mental health was most impacted by COVID-19, compared to 9% who said their financial health was impacted and 6% who said their physical health
Help Is Available
If you’re struggling with your mental health during COVID-19, you’re not alone. Reach out to loved ones or a mental health professional for support, and be gentle with yourself. Check out this list of mental health resources you can lean on right now. And no matter what you’re experiencing, know you’re not alone. This is hard and it’s OK to ask for help. “I’m learning it is OK to ask for help even during this pandemic. Especially during this pandemic,” wrote Mighty contributor Tori S., adding:
Right now is the time to be there for each other. To show our vulnerabilities, our struggles, the moments when we aren’t so ‘put-together.’ … I am learning that it is OK to not be OK; it is OK to show that I am not OK, and it is more than OK to ask for help when I need it.

Do you believe that your home can have an impact on your mental health? There are many driving factors in your mental state, including genetics, character, personality, and relationships. The environment in your house is one, too. Here are some points to think about. Having a clean home helps create a peaceful environment. That is good for your mental well-being because you will not have to think about clutter all over the house. It gives you a sense of tranquility, helping you rest and relax. Having a well-lit home is also welcome, particularly for people suffering from depression. It is common for them to like dark environments, which could only aggravate their loneliness. This would also only get worse if you make it a habit. Allowing natural light in your house can make you feel happier and more positive. It can lift your mood, leading you to become more productive in whatever task you have at hand, whether it is spring-cleaning the house or preparing for the property maintenance franchise opportunities a friend has offered you. It is also essential that you get a good sleep every night. And the quality of sleep that you get to enjoy is also dependent on the environment of your bedroom. Parts of the Home
Are you living with your family or friends? If you are living with your family, make sure you have a harmonious relationship. Eat meals together, spend time watching your favorite TV series, and talk at the end of the day, every day. Make it a point to spend quality time with each other. In case you are living with friends and have a hard time adjusting, you can talk to them to sort things out. Some parts of your home, meanwhile, can remind you of a breakup, like the flooring where you used to sit with your partner. This can affect your mood. If you are too affected, right now, it might help to go on a vacation for a while. Another aspect of the house that can influence your mood and health is the paint color. Happy colors like yellow, light pink, and other pastel hues promote a positive and delightful vibe. Dark colors can evoke too much emotion. Choose wisely. Home and Mental Health
Your housing location can do a lot for your mental health, as well. You tend to feel good when you live in a peaceful neighborhood. On the other hand, living in a neighborhood where crime is prevalent and vandalism is an ongoing thing can scare you off. You can become paranoid and fearful for your life. Lastly, the environment of the house can affect not only your mental health but physical health, too. As mentioned above, the state of the neighborhood you belong to can affect your feelings. For example, some houses have harmful chemicals or metals because they are already old. You can get serious illnesses like lead poisoning. The condition of your mind is somehow affected by the house you live in. Choose to live in a safe, welcoming, and positive area if you are prone to get affected mentally. A beautiful home, even if it is small, can help you think of good things and focus on living well. Live in a place where you can have peace of mind.

Renters are More Likely to Have Poor Health than Home Owners
Homes play vital roles in our lives. Home is the place where we rest, spend time with family and friends and the place where we can be ourselves. The house or apartment where we live should feel like a home. When you consider how important a role our home has in our lives, it is not surprising that researchers have found a link between the homes we live in and our overall health. Recent research explored a connection between housing and health by using an objective indicator: C-reactive protein level (CRP) which is a marker found in blood connected to stress and infections. Researchers found that private renters have higher levels of CRP in their blood indicating that they have poorer health compared to homeowners. However, the poorer health of renters may reflect the lower quality of their homes. If the private renters were paying more for their homes they are more likely to be healthier which is a strong link between home quality and overall health. Most renters are not ready to pay too much for a home if it is not necessary simply because they are aware that this is not a long-term solution. That is the main reason why most renters do not live in fully equipped homes. Plus, there is a stress typical for home renters while those who own property are less likely to experience stress linked to housing. Owning a house is a big milestone in everyone’s life while renters feel they are just not there yet. Does Your Skin Affect Your Mental Health? Almost every bottle of oral acne medication comes with a large warning about the risks it might have on our mental health. Brand name Accutane has a label with a statement:
“Accutane may cause depression, psychosis and, rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide, and aggressive and/or violent behaviors.”
This is not just a myth, there have been a number of high-profile suicides related to acne medicine isotretinoin such as the death of Seamus Todd, the son of the actor Richard Todd, who committed suicide. Some studies have proved there is a link between the use of isotretinoin and depression and suicidal thoughts, it is still not clear whether mental health issues are caused by the drug or the severe acne condition, especially since acne can temporarily get worse after using the medicine. Recent researchers contradict that the medicine itself could lead to suicide and depression. Dermatologists and psychiatrists are paying close attention to any link that can be found between acne and depression especially among young people. The field called psychodermatology investigates how the mind affects our skin and vice versa, if skin conditions can affect our mind. However, the nature of skin and mind connection is far from clear. It is very difficult to study any potential link between a person’s physical and mental health. Some researchers have found the link between stress and skin conditions, but we are far from completely understanding the link between our skin and mental health. Mental Health Crisis Among Soldiers
New figures have shown that mental health emergencies account for one in ten air evacuation of military personnel. Among many other issues, soldiers often struggle with PTSD, depression, stress, and anxiety. The mental health issue is the second most common reason for medical evacuation among military personnel, right after limb injuries. More soldiers were evacuated for mental health issues than spinal injuries or heart problems. Evacuations can take place due to emergency treatment which often prevents servicemen and women from carrying out their military duties. Often after treatment in their country, they can return to operations abroad or stay home. The servicemen and women are often under a high risk of self-harm due to their mental health conditions. We often don’t pay too much attention to mental health issues in the army. In the UK, a Ministry of Defense spokesman said:
“We are committed to the mental health of our service personnel and have increased funding in this area by £20 million. We have also launched an emergency mental health hotline and are working with experts and charities to tackle any perceived stigma around talking about mental health.”
Let’s not forget that soldiers do need all the help they can get to adjust to a new life when they come back from countries devastated by war.

In recent years, there has been a massive increase in mental health issues across all genders, age groups and cultures. This is a problem that will increase and will probably get worse before it gets better. Many people go through life accepting their problems, seeing them as “normal” or as a an inevitable consequence of their job, family life or upbringing. However, mental health issues always start somewhere and increasing amounts of research is looking at the link between stress and more serious disorders which can follow. Researchers define stress as a physical, mental, or emotional response to events that causes bodily or mental tension. Simply put, stress is any outside force or event that has an effect on our body or mind. Modern life is full of hassles, deadlines, frustrations, and demands. For many people, stress is so commonplace that it has become a way of life. However, stress is not always bad. In small doses, it can help you perform under pressure and motivate you to do your best. But when you’re constantly running in emergency mode, your mind and body pay the price. Stress is a normal physical response to events that make you feel threatened or upset your balance in some way. When you sense danger – whether it’s real or imagined – the body’s defenses kick into high gear in a rapid, automatic process known as the “fight-or-flight” reaction, or the stress response. The stress response is coordinated through two mechanisms:
1. changes in the activities of various brain regions and brain chemicals and
2. changes in the activity of a hormonal system. The stress response is the body’s way of protecting you. When working properly, it helps you stay focused, energetic, and alert. In emergency situations, stress can save your life – giving you extra strength to defend yourself, for example, or spurring you to slam on the brakes to avoid an accident. The stress response also helps you rise to meet challenges. Stress is what keeps you on your toes during a presentation at work, sharpens your concentration when you’re attempting the game-winning free throw, or drives you to study for an exam when you’d rather be watching TV but beyond a certain point, stress stops being helpful and starts causing major damage to your health, your mood, your productivity, your relationships, and your quality of life. It is shocking to learn what stress is doing to our body and mind. According to Mental Health America (MHA), here is what stress can do to us:
- The Brain:
- Stress can cause headaches, sadness, lack of energy, nervousness, irritability, trouble concentrating, memory issues, difficulty sleeping, and even mental health disorders themselves. - The Heart:
- If you are experiencing stress, you may have a faster heartbeat, heart palpitations, a rise in blood pressure, and an increased risk for high cholesterol and even heart attacks. - The Stomach:
- The stomach can be affected by stress—nausea, aches, heartburn, weight gain, and appetite changes are some of the symptoms. - The Pancreas:
- Stress can increase your risk for diabetes. - The Intestines:
- Diarrhea, constipation, and other digestive problems can occur due to stress. - The Reproductive Organs:
- For women, stress can cause irregular or painful periods and reduced sexual desire. In men, impotence, low sperm production, and reduced sexual desire may also occur. - Other Effects:
- Other effects on your body due to stress may be acne, muscle aches, and a weakened immune system. Some women may also be at an increased risk for low bone density. According to the American Psychological Association, nearly 70% of Americans experience physical and mental symptoms of stress. A study that was also released in 2005 by the American Psychological Association presented some very startling stress related statistics. It found that the six leading causes of death at that time, accidents, suicide, lung ailments, heart disease, cancer, and cirrhosis of the liver, could all be linked back to stress. At that time stress-related issues were the reasons for a full two-thirds of visits to the family doctor. Sixty four percent of Americans were working on lowering the amount of stress that they dealt with on a daily basis.Speaking on a global scale stress touches nearly every home no matter how big or how small. According to a study that was done by the Foundation for Integrated Research In Mental Health in 2007 some numbers stood out.

Cleaning for Mental Health
October 30, 2018
Everyone does their best to keep up on household chores and cleaning, but clutter always finds a way to seep back in. It’s as if messes pop up out of nowhere sometimes, no matter how often clean. If you staring down another Saturday’s worth of cleaning in the Stamford apartments, then there is some good news you might find surprising. Leading psychological research as attributed clutter to stress and anxiety, but recent studies discovered that cleaning up messes actually has a positive benefit on your mental health. That’s right. If you want to destress, then pick up a cleaning rag and a duster. Here’s the science behind why cleaning is good for your health. The University of California gathered thirty couples for a study on stress hormones. Those who described their house as messy or chaotic displayed increased levels of cortisol, a steroid hormone produced in the adrenal gland in response to stress. The same study also found that women were more adversely affected by clutter than men. So, a messy home has a negative impact on your health. It only makes sense that decreasing the clutter would alleviate your buildup of cortisol, therefore being a healthy habit. However, there’s more to it than just that. The Mental Benefits
Aside from improving cleanliness, cleaning does have a positive impact on your mental health. A recent study by the British Journal of Sports Medicine proved that a mere twenty minutes of physical activity was enough to decrease stress levels, but a Scottish Health Survey proved that activity didn’t have to be a workout. Over 3,000 people surveyed reported that regular housework was enough to decrease anxiety and stress levels, with further research placing that decrease at around 20%. While cleaning isn’t a cure all, that percentage can work wonders on your daily level of stress. Did you know that anxiety and stress are linked to a shorter lifespan? A 2015 study in the U.K. found that a stressful work environment can take up to 33 years off your life. Most people have stressful jobs, but adding on the stress of a cluttered home could be even more detrimental. If you can clean for just twenty minutes a day, you can reduce the impact that stress has on your life. It gets even better, though. Vigorous cleaning (like washing the floors) is an outlet for negative emotions thanks to the energy your burn while scrubbing away. Individuals also reported having an easier time unwinding at the end of the day when their home was cleaned. Altogether, that means doing household chores after a rough day at the office is the perfect remedy. The Physical Benefits
Another study conducted by Indiana University’s Physical Activity Department looked at the impact a clean home had on both physical and mental health. Their findings on mental health coincided with the benefits found by previous studies, but they did find one interesting correlation between a cluttered home and an individual’s activity level. As it turn out, people with the cleanest homes are the most active. While the correlation is unclear, there’s something about clutter that causes people to lose motivation, choosing to sit down in front of the TV instead of go for a walk or hit the gym. Another benefit to a clean home is a lack of allergens waiting to attack your immune system. The longer you go without cleaning your home (really cleaning, not just dusting) the more polluted the air inside your home becomes. Compared to right outside your front door, your home’s air quality is often five times worse on any given day. That means more pollen, dust mites, dander, and other allergens hiding in plain sight. Regular cleaning your home is an excellent way to relieve stress, stay active, and feel your best by removing the pesky elements lingering in the air. Keeping up with such a rigorous cleaning schedule isn’t exactly easy, though. However, there are a few steps you can take to make this chore less taxing. De-Clutter for Good
The first step to de-cluttering your home is to cut back on the number of things you purchase. If you take a moment to think about it, how many items in your home are simply collecting dust? How many items do you own and never use? If you have a free weekend, then you might want to consider taking the time to sort through all of your belongings and sell or donate the items you don’t need. Closets are an excellent place to start, as are cupboards and any form of storage space.

Everyone feels stressed from time to time. But what is stress? How does it affect your health? And what can you do about it? Stress is how the brain and body respond to any demand. Every type of stressor—such as exercise, work, school, significant life changes, or traumatic events—can be stressful. Stress can affect your health. It is essential to pay attention to how you deal with minor and significant stress events so that you know when to seek help. Below are 5 things you should know about stress and how you can relieve it. 1. Everyone is affected
Everyone feels stressed from time to time. Some people may cope more efficiently or recover from stressful events more quickly than others. There are different types of stress—all of which carry physical and mental health risks. A stressor may be a one time or short-term occurrence, or it can be an occurrence that keeps happening over an extended period. Examples of stress include:
- Routine pressures of work, school, family and other daily responsibilities
- A sudden adverse change, such as losing a job, divorce, or illness
- A traumatic experience such as a major accident, war, assault, or a natural disaster where people may be in danger of being seriously hurt or killed. People who experience traumatic stress often experience temporary symptoms of mental illness, but most recover naturally soon after. 2. Not all stress is severe
Stress can motivate people to prepare or perform, like when they need to take a test or interview for a new job. It can even be life-saving in some situations. In response to danger, your body prepares to face a threat or flee to safety. In these circumstances, your pulse quickens, you breathe faster, your muscles tense, your brain uses more oxygen and increases activity—all functions aimed at survival. 3. Long-term effects can harm your health
Health problems can occur if the stress response goes on for too long or becomes chronic, such as when the source of is constant, or if the reaction continues after the danger has subsided. With chronic stress, those same life-saving responses in your body can suppress immune, digestive, sleep, and reproductive systems, which may cause them to stop working usually. Different people are affected in different ways. For example, some people experience mainly digestive symptoms, while others may have headaches, sleeplessness, sadness, anger or irritability. People under chronic stress are prone to more frequent and severe viral infections, such as the flu or common cold. Routine stress may be the hardest type to notice at first. Because the source tends to be more constant than in cases of acute or traumatic stress, the body gets no clear signal to return to normal functioning. Over time, continued strain on your body may contribute to serious health problems, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and other illnesses, as well as mental disorders like depression or anxiety. 4. There are ways to manage stress
The effects of stress tend to build up over time. Taking practical steps to can reduce or prevent these results. The following are some tips that may help you to cope better:
- Recognize the signs of your body’s response, such as difficulty sleeping, increased alcohol and other substance use, being easily angered, feeling depressed, and having low energy. - Talk to Your Doctor or Health Care Provider. Get proper health care for existing or new health problems. - Get Regular Exercise. Just 30 minutes per day of walking can help boost your mood and reduce stress. - Try a Relaxing Activity. Explore coping programs, which may incorporate meditation, yoga, tai chi, or other gentle exercises. For some related conditions, these approaches are used in addition to other forms of treatment. Schedule regular times for these and other healthy and relaxing activities. Learn more about these techniques on the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) website at (www.nccih.nih.gov/health/stress)
- Set Goals and Priorities. Decide what must get done and what can wait, and learn to say no to new tasks if they are putting you on overload. Note what you have accomplished at the end of the day, not what you have been unable to do. - Stay Connected with people who can provide emotional and other support. Ask for help from friends, family, and community or religious organizations. - Consider a Clinical Trial. Researchers at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), NCCIH, and other research facilities across the country are studying the causes and effects of psychological stress, and stress management techniques.

What is stress? Stress is something we all encounter at some time in our lives, no matter what our circumstances. It is an unavoidable part of being alive. When we are faced with change, or threatened or challenged in any way, we come under stress. How we respond varies from person to person. A situation that one person finds intolerable may be stimulating and exciting to another. Too little stimulation, resulting in boredom, can also cause problems, which is why some people may feel more stressed after they have retired from work than when they were doing a highly demanding job. Stress affects us not only mentally but can bring about physical changes too. In fact, our bodies’ response to stress clearly illustrates the way in which our mental health can be directly linked to physical problems. Animals respond to danger by turning to face the fight or fleeing. This is called the ‘fight or flight’ response. Human beings share this automatic bodily reaction, and we respond to emotional stress as if it were a physical threat. You may only be having an argument with a colleague at work, but you are physically ready for a life-or-death struggle with a lion. Your muscles grow tense, ready for action, your heart beats faster, your blood pressure goes up, you breathe faster and sweat more, and your mouth becomes dry. These physical reactions are caused by the release of adrenaline and other hormones into the bloodstream. The reason why different people react differently to stress is because the intensity of the hormone response varies from person to person, according to lifestyle and genetic make-up. Your personality affects how stressful you judge a situation to be and how you deal with it. A troubled childhood may make you more vulnerable to stress, while being in a supportive relationship or family situation is thought to give some protection from stress. Experiencing a certain amount of stress can result in a surge of energy that will help you to achieve your goals in life. Without it, you may not be alert enough to perform well or to make appropriate changes should any difficulties or obstacles arise. However, problems tend to occur when you are constantly reacting to stressful situations without taking, or feeling you are able to take, any action to counter their effects. When someone is under too much stress for too long, it can threaten their health and well-being. The resulting continual rise in levels of adrenaline can lead to the development of certain illnesses. These may be relatively minor such as insomnia, backache or headaches, but stress has also been identified as a contributory factor in several potentially life-threatening conditions, including high blood pressure and heart disease. Some people have a good awareness of their stress levels – even if they succumb to stress easily, they know how to recognize its symptoms and to deal with them effectively – while others fail to recognize their condition or try to cope by ignoring it. It is common for people affected by stress to turn to alcohol, cigarettes, tranquillizers or other drugs as a way of dealing with the problem. But such responses can eventually cause physical, emotional and behavioural problems, which can also affect their health and peace of mind. These problems can have an impact on relationships at home and in the workplace. Who is at risk for stress? In modern life, stress is most likely to be caused by worries concerning your job, finances, health, personal life or surroundings that make you feel under constant pressure. Generally speaking, stress arises from events that create a sense of anxiety, uncertainty or loss. In addition, a feeling of being out of control frequently accompanies such events. If you feel in control of your life, you will often still function well despite being subjected to a constant flow of highly demanding situations. Symptoms of stress
Stress shows itself in various ways. If you are under stress, you may notice a number of the following physical, emotional or behavioural signs. - Breathlessness or palpitations. - Muscle cramps, aches or spasms. - Constipation or diarrhea. - Headaches, migraines or backache. - Skin problems such as eczema or acne. - Tiredness or insomnia. - Panic attacks. - Frequent colds. - Irritability or impatience. - Anxiety and fear. - Anger or aggression. - Mood swings. - Inability to express or feel emotion. - Difficulty concentrating. - Problems making decisions. - Eating, smoking or drinking more.

Stress is a state of physical or emotional tension caused by any thoughts, feelings, or occurrences that make you angry, frustrated, or anxious. The truth is that chronic stress can be deadly if it persists for an extended time. If left untreated and uncontrolled, it can cause havoc on all aspects of your life. Stress, when not managed, can have an impact on your personal and professional lives. The Harmful Effects of Stress To Your Body
While stress is intended to be a temporary reaction to distress, it is not intended to be a permanent state of being. Let’s look at why stress can be fatal if left untreated and unmanaged. It weakens the immune system
Have you ever become ill as a result of overworking yourself or dealing with an emotional situation at home? Stress weakens immune system responses, and as a result, your body’s lymphocytes, also known as white blood cells, are reduced, rendering them unable to fight infection. According to Nadia Hasan, DO, a physician at Delancey Internal Medicine, “The lesser your lymphocyte levels, the more vulnerable you are to viruses such as the common cold.” When you are under stress, you are more vulnerable to common illnesses. People who manage their stress well are less likely to get the common cold, allergies, or the seasonal flu. Stress has a physiological impact on your body
High levels of stress have been linked to a variety of health issues and illnesses. You are more likely to suffer from strokes, heart attacks, headaches and migraines, and other cardiovascular diseases if you do not have a system in place for dealing with and managing stress. When you are stressed, your blood pressure rises, your heart rate quickens, and you may experience other symptoms. Signs of Excessive Stress
Stress can cause a variety of physical and emotional symptoms. Most of the time, we are unaware that the symptoms we are experiencing are the result of stress. Excessive stress can result in a variety of mental and physical health problems. Here are some signs that you might be stressed:
- Stiff neck or jaw
- Sleep disorder
- Constipation or diarrhea
- Stomachache, diarrhea or constipation
- Body aches and pains on a regular basis
- Weight loss or gain
- Lack of energy
- Lack of focus
- Weight gain or loss
Ways to Cope with Stress
Exercising can help you de-stress at any time. Physical activity, according to medical practitioners, is one of the best ways to reduce stress and maintain mental health. Endorphins are released into the brain when you exercise. The chemicals are antidepressants that act as stress buffers. When you spend some time at the gym or go for a walk or run, and you will not only feel happier but will also be able to sleep better. Practice meditation and mindfulness
Meditation and mindfulness have been shown to improve a person’s stress level and ability to cope with stress. These practices entail setting aside at least five or ten minutes each day to spend in a quiet, distraction-free space. An important aspect of these practices is paying attention to your body’s natural breathing patterns. Relax by concentrating on your breathing. When we are stressed, we often forget to eat healthily. We consume large amounts of caffeine, alcohol, fatty snacks, and sugary foods. This may momentarily lessen your stress level, but it has long-term health consequences and may cause you certain health concerns. If you want to alleviate stress, it’s recommended to avoid these meals and eat healthily. Eat more organic fruits and vegetables and drink more water. Fish is abundant in omega-3 fatty acids and is beneficial for stress relief. Get enough sleep
Sadly, sleep deprivation is a major source of stress. If you don’t get enough sleep at night, your body won’t function effectively as it should. Lack of sleep throws your brain and body out of sync, and you become stressed. Thus, ensure you get about seven to eight hours of sleep every night. If stress keeps you awake at night, reduce your light, switch off the tv, and practice meditation. Getting enough sleep is one of the most effective stress relievers. It’s pretty important to notice and recognize stressful situations so that you can focus on how to deal with them. Hey Joyfreshers, how do you cope with stress? Let’s discuss them below!

The Negative Impact Of Stress [Infographic]
In 2020, the negative impact of stress can be felt in all areas of our lives. There is a profound and challenging struggle in understanding what is driving our stress, what its real impacts are, and ways we can manage our stress for our well-being. Having complementary daily strategies in place to manage and actively work to minimise stress is key to caring for your health in a holistic way that nurtures your long-term well-being. Why Is A Holistic Approach Necessary For Stress Management? Holistic steps play a significant role in approaching a health issue like stress because the triggers are genuinely multifaceted. Additionally, the impacts are far-reaching therefore dynamic methodologies can help you to work towards a healthier life. In fact, HealthKnowledge.org.uk says that, “Mental health and physical health are inextricably linked, with evidence for a strong relationship between the two accumulating over recent decades and challenging the historical notion of mind-body duality.” They go further to say that public mental health has been recognised as integral to public health, therefore emphasising the New Economics Foundation’s five evidence-based actions individuals can take for their well-being: connect, be active, take notice, keep learning, and give. A comprehensive combination of mindfulness, rest, rejuvenation, prioritising your physical health through diet and exercise, specialist and community support, and lifestyle planning are a starting point for you to approach handling stress as a well-being strategy rather than a stress strategy alone.

One out of five said they used prescription drugs for non-prescription reasons and one out of seven used illicit drugs\n6. Parenting Is Hard\nAll memes and good fun aside, the truth underlying those hilarious parenting memes is that parenting right now is hard. With schools closed, parents have taken on a much more intensive role in their child’s day-to-day life, all while being stuck at home more than ever. It’s a lot, and it’s taking its toll. - 20% of parents with children were struggling with their mental health, compared to 13% of those without young kids in the house\n- 31% of women with children working full-time felt they had more on their plate than they could handle compared to 13% of men\n- Women are spending 7.4 more hours per week on childcare than men, Latinx and Black women spend 4 to 12 hours more each week than white women and single mothers another 7 hours more than women overall\n7.

There are many driving factors in your mental state, including genetics, character, personality, and relationships. The environment in your house is one, too. Here are some points to think about. Having a clean home helps create a peaceful environment. That is good for your mental well-being because you will not have to think about clutter all over the house. It gives you a sense of tranquility, helping you rest and relax. Having a well-lit home is also welcome, particularly for people suffering from depression. It is common for them to like dark environments, which could only aggravate their loneliness. This would also only get worse if you make it a habit. Allowing natural light in your house can make you feel happier and more positive. It can lift your mood, leading you to become more productive in whatever task you have at hand, whether it is spring-cleaning the house or preparing for the property maintenance franchise opportunities a friend has offered you. It is also essential that you get a good sleep every night. And the quality of sleep that you get to enjoy is also dependent on the environment of your bedroom. Parts of the Home\nAre you living with your family or friends? If you are living with your family, make sure you have a harmonious relationship. Eat meals together, spend time watching your favorite TV series, and talk at the end of the day, every day. Make it a point to spend quality time with each other. In case you are living with friends and have a hard time adjusting, you can talk to them to sort things out. Some parts of your home, meanwhile, can remind you of a breakup, like the flooring where you used to sit with your partner. This can affect your mood. If you are too affected, right now, it might help to go on a vacation for a while. Another aspect of the house that can influence your mood and health is the paint color. Happy colors like yellow, light pink, and other pastel hues promote a positive and delightful vibe. Dark colors can evoke too much emotion. Choose wisely. Home and Mental Health\nYour housing location can do a lot for your mental health, as well. You tend to feel good when you live in a peaceful neighborhood. On the other hand, living in a neighborhood where crime is prevalent and vandalism is an ongoing thing can scare you off. You can become paranoid and fearful for your life. Lastly, the environment of the house can affect not only your mental health but physical health, too. As mentioned above, the state of the neighborhood you belong to can affect your feelings. For example, some houses have harmful chemicals or metals because they are already old. You can get serious illnesses like lead poisoning. The condition of your mind is somehow affected by the house you live in. Choose to live in a safe, welcoming, and positive area if you are prone to get affected mentally. A beautiful home, even if it is small, can help you think of good things and focus on living well.

When you consider how important a role our home has in our lives, it is not surprising that researchers have found a link between the homes we live in and our overall health. Recent research explored a connection between housing and health by using an objective indicator: C-reactive protein level (CRP) which is a marker found in blood connected to stress and infections. Researchers found that private renters have higher levels of CRP in their blood indicating that they have poorer health compared to homeowners. However, the poorer health of renters may reflect the lower quality of their homes. If the private renters were paying more for their homes they are more likely to be healthier which is a strong link between home quality and overall health. Most renters are not ready to pay too much for a home if it is not necessary simply because they are aware that this is not a long-term solution. That is the main reason why most renters do not live in fully equipped homes. Plus, there is a stress typical for home renters while those who own property are less likely to experience stress linked to housing. Owning a house is a big milestone in everyone’s life while renters feel they are just not there yet. Does Your Skin Affect Your Mental Health? Almost every bottle of oral acne medication comes with a large warning about the risks it might have on our mental health. Brand name Accutane has a label with a statement:\n“Accutane may cause depression, psychosis and, rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide, and aggressive and/or violent behaviors.”\nThis is not just a myth, there have been a number of high-profile suicides related to acne medicine isotretinoin such as the death of Seamus Todd, the son of the actor Richard Todd, who committed suicide. Some studies have proved there is a link between the use of isotretinoin and depression and suicidal thoughts, it is still not clear whether mental health issues are caused by the drug or the severe acne condition, especially since acne can temporarily get worse after using the medicine. Recent researchers contradict that the medicine itself could lead to suicide and depression. Dermatologists and psychiatrists are paying close attention to any link that can be found between acne and depression especially among young people. The field called psychodermatology investigates how the mind affects our skin and vice versa, if skin conditions can affect our mind. However, the nature of skin and mind connection is far from clear. It is very difficult to study any potential link between a person’s physical and mental health. Some researchers have found the link between stress and skin conditions, but we are far from completely understanding the link between our skin and mental health. Mental Health Crisis Among Soldiers\nNew figures have shown that mental health emergencies account for one in ten air evacuation of military personnel. Among many other issues, soldiers often struggle with PTSD, depression, stress, and anxiety. The mental health issue is the second most common reason for medical evacuation among military personnel, right after limb injuries. More soldiers were evacuated for mental health issues than spinal injuries or heart problems. Evacuations can take place due to emergency treatment which often prevents servicemen and women from carrying out their military duties. Often after treatment in their country, they can return to operations abroad or stay home. The servicemen and women are often under a high risk of self-harm due to their mental health conditions. We often don’t pay too much attention to mental health issues in the army. In the UK, a Ministry of Defense spokesman said:\n“We are committed to the mental health of our service personnel and have increased funding in this area by £20 million. We have also launched an emergency mental health hotline and are working with experts and charities to tackle any perceived stigma around talking about mental health.”\nLet’s not forget that soldiers do need all the help they can get to adjust to a new life when they come back from countries devastated by war.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:7bd5efe6-f7ad-47a7-bade-485e319ff0a9>']}, {'passage': 'In recent years, there has been a massive increase in mental health issues across all genders, age groups and cultures. This is a problem that will increase and will probably get worse before it gets better. Many people go through life accepting their problems, seeing them as “normal” or as a an inevitable consequence of their job, family life or upbringing. However, mental health issues always start somewhere and increasing amounts of research is looking at the link between stress and more serious disorders which can follow. Researchers define stress as a physical, mental, or emotional response to events that causes bodily or mental tension. Simply put, stress is any outside force or event that has an effect on our body or mind. Modern life is full of hassles, deadlines, frustrations, and demands. For many people, stress is so commonplace that it has become a way of life. However, stress is not always bad. In small doses, it can help you perform under pressure and motivate you to do your best. But when you’re constantly running in emergency mode, your mind and body pay the price. Stress is a normal physical response to events that make you feel threatened or upset your balance in some way. When you sense danger – whether it’s real or imagined – the body’s defenses kick into high gear in a rapid, automatic process known as the “fight-or-flight” reaction, or the stress response. The stress response is coordinated through two mechanisms:\n1. changes in the activities of various brain regions and brain chemicals and\n2. changes in the activity of a hormonal system. The stress response is the body’s way of protecting you. When working properly, it helps you stay focused, energetic, and alert. In emergency situations, stress can save your life – giving you extra strength to defend yourself, for example, or spurring you to slam on the brakes to avoid an accident. The stress response also helps you rise to meet challenges. Stress is what keeps you on your toes during a presentation at work, sharpens your concentration when you’re attempting the game-winning free throw, or drives you to study for an exam when you’d rather be watching TV but beyond a certain point, stress stops being helpful and starts causing major damage to your health, your mood, your productivity, your relationships, and your quality of life. It is shocking to learn what stress is doing to our body and mind. According to Mental Health America (MHA), here is what stress can do to us:\n- The Brain:\n- Stress can cause headaches, sadness, lack of energy, nervousness, irritability, trouble concentrating, memory issues, difficulty sleeping, and even mental health disorders themselves. - The Heart:\n- If you are experiencing stress, you may have a faster heartbeat, heart palpitations, a rise in blood pressure, and an increased risk for high cholesterol and even heart attacks. - The Stomach:\n- The stomach can be affected by stress—nausea, aches, heartburn, weight gain, and appetite changes are some of the symptoms. - The Pancreas:\n- Stress can increase your risk for diabetes. - The Intestines:\n- Diarrhea, constipation, and other digestive problems can occur due to stress. - The Reproductive Organs:\n- For women, stress can cause irregular or painful periods and reduced sexual desire. In men, impotence, low sperm production, and reduced sexual desire may also occur. - Other Effects:\n- Other effects on your body due to stress may be acne, muscle aches, and a weakened immune system. Some women may also be at an increased risk for low bone density. According to the American Psychological Association, nearly 70% of Americans experience physical and mental symptoms of stress. A study that was also released in 2005 by the American Psychological Association presented some very startling stress related statistics. It found that the six leading causes of death at that time, accidents, suicide, lung ailments, heart disease, cancer, and cirrhosis of the liver, could all be linked back to stress. At that time stress-related issues were the reasons for a full two-thirds of visits to the family doctor. Sixty four percent of Americans were working on lowering the amount of stress that they dealt with on a daily basis.Speaking on a global scale stress touches nearly every home no matter how big or how small. According to a study that was done by the Foundation for Integrated Research In Mental Health in 2007 some numbers stood out.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:eb6416b4-dab6-46f6-bb92-3f1e16e2d2fb>']}, {'passage': 'Cleaning for Mental Health\nOctober 30, 2018\nEveryone does their best to keep up on household chores and cleaning, but clutter always finds a way to seep back in. It’s as if messes pop up out of nowhere sometimes, no matter how often clean. If you staring down another Saturday’s worth of cleaning in the Stamford apartments, then there is some good news you might find surprising. Leading psychological research as attributed clutter to stress and anxiety, but recent studies discovered that cleaning up messes actually has a positive benefit on your mental health. That’s right. If you want to destress, then pick up a cleaning rag and a duster. Here’s the science behind why cleaning is good for your health. The University of California gathered thirty couples for a study on stress hormones. Those who described their house as messy or chaotic displayed increased levels of cortisol, a steroid hormone produced in the adrenal gland in response to stress. The same study also found that women were more adversely affected by clutter than men. So, a messy home has a negative impact on your health. It only makes sense that decreasing the clutter would alleviate your buildup of cortisol, therefore being a healthy habit. However, there’s more to it than just that. The Mental Benefits\nAside from improving cleanliness, cleaning does have a positive impact on your mental health. A recent study by the British Journal of Sports Medicine proved that a mere twenty minutes of physical activity was enough to decrease stress levels, but a Scottish Health Survey proved that activity didn’t have to be a workout. Over 3,000 people surveyed reported that regular housework was enough to decrease anxiety and stress levels, with further research placing that decrease at around 20%. While cleaning isn’t a cure all, that percentage can work wonders on your daily level of stress. Did you know that anxiety and stress are linked to a shorter lifespan? A 2015 study in the U.K. found that a stressful work environment can take up to 33 years off your life. Most people have stressful jobs, but adding on the stress of a cluttered home could be even more detrimental. If you can clean for just twenty minutes a day, you can reduce the impact that stress has on your life. It gets even better, though. Vigorous cleaning (like washing the floors) is an outlet for negative emotions thanks to the energy your burn while scrubbing away. Individuals also reported having an easier time unwinding at the end of the day when their home was cleaned. Altogether, that means doing household chores after a rough day at the office is the perfect remedy. The Physical Benefits\nAnother study conducted by Indiana University’s Physical Activity Department looked at the impact a clean home had on both physical and mental health. Their findings on mental health coincided with the benefits found by previous studies, but they did find one interesting correlation between a cluttered home and an individual’s activity level. As it turn out, people with the cleanest homes are the most active. While the correlation is unclear, there’s something about clutter that causes people to lose motivation, choosing to sit down in front of the TV instead of go for a walk or hit the gym. Another benefit to a clean home is a lack of allergens waiting to attack your immune system. The longer you go without cleaning your home (really cleaning, not just dusting) the more polluted the air inside your home becomes. Compared to right outside your front door, your home’s air quality is often five times worse on any given day. That means more pollen, dust mites, dander, and other allergens hiding in plain sight. Regular cleaning your home is an excellent way to relieve stress, stay active, and feel your best by removing the pesky elements lingering in the air. Keeping up with such a rigorous cleaning schedule isn’t exactly easy, though. However, there are a few steps you can take to make this chore less taxing. De-Clutter for Good\nThe first step to de-cluttering your home is to cut back on the number of things you purchase. If you take a moment to think about it, how many items in your home are simply collecting dust? How many items do you own and never use? If you have a free weekend, then you might want to consider taking the time to sort through all of your belongings and sell or donate the items you don’t need. Closets are an excellent place to start, as are cupboards and any form of storage space.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:17b68d11-c02d-4f5a-b36e-0056e31b02bb>']}, {'passage': 'Everyone feels stressed from time to time. But what is stress? How does it affect your health? And what can you do about it? Stress is how the brain and body respond to any demand. Every type of stressor—such as exercise, work, school, significant life changes, or traumatic events—can be stressful. Stress can affect your health. It is essential to pay attention to how you deal with minor and significant stress events so that you know when to seek help. Below are 5 things you should know about stress and how you can relieve it. 1. Everyone is affected\nEveryone feels stressed from time to time. Some people may cope more efficiently or recover from stressful events more quickly than others. There are different types of stress—all of which carry physical and mental health risks. A stressor may be a one time or short-term occurrence, or it can be an occurrence that keeps happening over an extended period. Examples of stress include:\n- Routine pressures of work, school, family and other daily responsibilities\n- A sudden adverse change, such as losing a job, divorce, or illness\n- A traumatic experience such as a major accident, war, assault, or a natural disaster where people may be in danger of being seriously hurt or killed. People who experience traumatic stress often experience temporary symptoms of mental illness, but most recover naturally soon after. 2. Not all stress is severe\nStress can motivate people to prepare or perform, like when they need to take a test or interview for a new job. It can even be life-saving in some situations. In response to danger, your body prepares to face a threat or flee to safety. In these circumstances, your pulse quickens, you breathe faster, your muscles tense, your brain uses more oxygen and increases activity—all functions aimed at survival. 3. Long-term effects can harm your health\nHealth problems can occur if the stress response goes on for too long or becomes chronic, such as when the source of is constant, or if the reaction continues after the danger has subsided. With chronic stress, those same life-saving responses in your body can suppress immune, digestive, sleep, and reproductive systems, which may cause them to stop working usually. Different people are affected in different ways. For example, some people experience mainly digestive symptoms, while others may have headaches, sleeplessness, sadness, anger or irritability. People under chronic stress are prone to more frequent and severe viral infections, such as the flu or common cold. Routine stress may be the hardest type to notice at first. Because the source tends to be more constant than in cases of acute or traumatic stress, the body gets no clear signal to return to normal functioning. Over time, continued strain on your body may contribute to serious health problems, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and other illnesses, as well as mental disorders like depression or anxiety. 4. There are ways to manage stress\nThe effects of stress tend to build up over time. Taking practical steps to can reduce or prevent these results. The following are some tips that may help you to cope better:\n- Recognize the signs of your body’s response, such as difficulty sleeping, increased alcohol and other substance use, being easily angered, feeling depressed, and having low energy. - Talk to Your Doctor or Health Care Provider. Get proper health care for existing or new health problems. - Get Regular Exercise. Just 30 minutes per day of walking can help boost your mood and reduce stress. - Try a Relaxing Activity. Explore coping programs, which may incorporate meditation, yoga, tai chi, or other gentle exercises. For some related conditions, these approaches are used in addition to other forms of treatment. Schedule regular times for these and other healthy and relaxing activities. Learn more about these techniques on the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) website at (www.nccih.nih.gov/health/stress)\n- Set Goals and Priorities. Decide what must get done and what can wait, and learn to say no to new tasks if they are putting you on overload. Note what you have accomplished at the end of the day, not what you have been unable to do. - Stay Connected with people who can provide emotional and other support. Ask for help from friends, family, and community or religious organizations. - Consider a Clinical Trial. Researchers at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), NCCIH, and other research facilities across the country are studying the causes and effects of psychological stress, and stress management techniques.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:93076841-e42d-409d-b2b6-17c9aefd0a4b>']}, {'passage': 'Source: Adapted from Family Medical Adviser, Reader’s Digest\nWhat is stress? Stress is something we all encounter at some time in our lives, no matter what our circumstances. It is an unavoidable part of being alive. When we are faced with change, or threatened or challenged in any way, we come under stress. How we respond varies from person to person. A situation that one person finds intolerable may be stimulating and exciting to another. Too little stimulation, resulting in boredom, can also cause problems, which is why some people may feel more stressed after they have retired from work than when they were doing a highly demanding job. Stress affects us not only mentally but can bring about physical changes too. In fact, our bodies’ response to stress clearly illustrates the way in which our mental health can be directly linked to physical problems. Animals respond to danger by turning to face the fight or fleeing. This is called the ‘fight or flight’ response. Human beings share this automatic bodily reaction, and we respond to emotional stress as if it were a physical threat. You may only be having an argument with a colleague at work, but you are physically ready for a life-or-death struggle with a lion. Your muscles grow tense, ready for action, your heart beats faster, your blood pressure goes up, you breathe faster and sweat more, and your mouth becomes dry. These physical reactions are caused by the release of adrenaline and other hormones into the bloodstream. The reason why different people react differently to stress is because the intensity of the hormone response varies from person to person, according to lifestyle and genetic make-up. Your personality affects how stressful you judge a situation to be and how you deal with it. A troubled childhood may make you more vulnerable to stress, while being in a supportive relationship or family situation is thought to give some protection from stress. Experiencing a certain amount of stress can result in a surge of energy that will help you to achieve your goals in life. Without it, you may not be alert enough to perform well or to make appropriate changes should any difficulties or obstacles arise. However, problems tend to occur when you are constantly reacting to stressful situations without taking, or feeling you are able to take, any action to counter their effects. When someone is under too much stress for too long, it can threaten their health and well-being. The resulting continual rise in levels of adrenaline can lead to the development of certain illnesses. These may be relatively minor such as insomnia, backache or headaches, but stress has also been identified as a contributory factor in several potentially life-threatening conditions, including high blood pressure and heart disease. Some people have a good awareness of their stress levels – even if they succumb to stress easily, they know how to recognize its symptoms and to deal with them effectively – while others fail to recognize their condition or try to cope by ignoring it. It is common for people affected by stress to turn to alcohol, cigarettes, tranquillizers or other drugs as a way of dealing with the problem. But such responses can eventually cause physical, emotional and behavioural problems, which can also affect their health and peace of mind. These problems can have an impact on relationships at home and in the workplace. Who is at risk for stress? In modern life, stress is most likely to be caused by worries concerning your job, finances, health, personal life or surroundings that make you feel under constant pressure. Generally speaking, stress arises from events that create a sense of anxiety, uncertainty or loss. In addition, a feeling of being out of control frequently accompanies such events. If you feel in control of your life, you will often still function well despite being subjected to a constant flow of highly demanding situations. Symptoms of stress\nStress shows itself in various ways. If you are under stress, you may notice a number of the following physical, emotional or behavioural signs. - Breathlessness or palpitations. - Muscle cramps, aches or spasms. - Constipation or diarrhea. - Headaches, migraines or backache. - Skin problems such as eczema or acne. - Tiredness or insomnia. - Panic attacks. - Frequent colds. - Irritability or impatience. - Anxiety and fear. - Anger or aggression. - Mood swings. - Inability to express or feel emotion. - Difficulty concentrating. - Problems making decisions. - Eating, smoking or drinking more.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:7c60b7e4-307c-4cb9-af94-d2eaab83200e>']}, {'passage': 'Whether it be a health crisis, job loss, death of a loved one, break up or other difficulty, we all must face and confront losses.

The truth is that chronic stress can be deadly if it persists for an extended time. If left untreated and uncontrolled, it can cause havoc on all aspects of your life. Stress, when not managed, can have an impact on your personal and professional lives. The Harmful Effects of Stress To Your Body\nWhile stress is intended to be a temporary reaction to distress, it is not intended to be a permanent state of being. Let’s look at why stress can be fatal if left untreated and unmanaged. It weakens the immune system\nHave you ever become ill as a result of overworking yourself or dealing with an emotional situation at home? Stress weakens immune system responses, and as a result, your body’s lymphocytes, also known as white blood cells, are reduced, rendering them unable to fight infection. According to Nadia Hasan, DO, a physician at Delancey Internal Medicine, “The lesser your lymphocyte levels, the more vulnerable you are to viruses such as the common cold.” When you are under stress, you are more vulnerable to common illnesses. People who manage their stress well are less likely to get the common cold, allergies, or the seasonal flu. Stress has a physiological impact on your body\nHigh levels of stress have been linked to a variety of health issues and illnesses. You are more likely to suffer from strokes, heart attacks, headaches and migraines, and other cardiovascular diseases if you do not have a system in place for dealing with and managing stress. When you are stressed, your blood pressure rises, your heart rate quickens, and you may experience other symptoms. Signs of Excessive Stress\nStress can cause a variety of physical and emotional symptoms. Most of the time, we are unaware that the symptoms we are experiencing are the result of stress. Excessive stress can result in a variety of mental and physical health problems. Here are some signs that you might be stressed:\n- Stiff neck or jaw\n- Sleep disorder\n- Constipation or diarrhea\n- Stomachache, diarrhea or constipation\n- Body aches and pains on a regular basis\n- Weight loss or gain\n- Lack of energy\n- Lack of focus\n- Weight gain or loss\nWays to Cope with Stress\nExercising can help you de-stress at any time. Physical activity, according to medical practitioners, is one of the best ways to reduce stress and maintain mental health. Endorphins are released into the brain when you exercise. The chemicals are antidepressants that act as stress buffers. When you spend some time at the gym or go for a walk or run, and you will not only feel happier but will also be able to sleep better. Practice meditation and mindfulness\nMeditation and mindfulness have been shown to improve a person’s stress level and ability to cope with stress. These practices entail setting aside at least five or ten minutes each day to spend in a quiet, distraction-free space. An important aspect of these practices is paying attention to your body’s natural breathing patterns. Relax by concentrating on your breathing. When we are stressed, we often forget to eat healthily. We consume large amounts of caffeine, alcohol, fatty snacks, and sugary foods. This may momentarily lessen your stress level, but it has long-term health consequences and may cause you certain health concerns. If you want to alleviate stress, it’s recommended to avoid these meals and eat healthily. Eat more organic fruits and vegetables and drink more water. Fish is abundant in omega-3 fatty acids and is beneficial for stress relief. Get enough sleep\nSadly, sleep deprivation is a major source of stress. If you don’t get enough sleep at night, your body won’t function effectively as it should. Lack of sleep throws your brain and body out of sync, and you become stressed. Thus, ensure you get about seven to eight hours of sleep every night. If stress keeps you awake at night, reduce your light, switch off the tv, and practice meditation. Getting enough sleep is one of the most effective stress relievers. It’s pretty important to notice and recognize stressful situations so that you can focus on how to deal with them.

                ""text"": ""In today\u2019s America, the government and the lenders are completely disconnected from the very real troubles that homeowners are experiencing. The massive foreclosure mess that has crippled our economy has huge social repercussions that all the Band-Aid lending programs in the world are not able to prepare. We are in crisis and those who lead us are failing to see the connection between the loss of homes and the forces crushing the resilience of the American spirit. In the most recent report released by the U.S. Census Bureau, joblessness has pushed another 2.6 million people into poverty last year, with 15.1 percent of Americans counted as poor -- the highest rate since 1993. Approximately 46.2 million people in the United States live in poverty. For a family of four with two children, that means making less than $22,113 a year. What I see when I look at those numbers are literally millions of families that have lost, or are very close to losing their homes. This foreclosure crisis has not been caused by people looking for ways to shirk their obligations. Most Americans who signed their mortgage papers understood that a promissory note symbolized their responsibility to repay a debt. But an economic tailspin, declining home values, and shrinking job market have made it too difficult--if not outright impossible--for them to keep their end of what was often an unreasonable expectation in the first place. These regular Americans are in the most distressing situation you can imagine. They have gone through their retirement plans, their savings accounts, and their checking accounts are drained. They have liquidated vehicles or other assets and racked up credit card debt. They have done all these things in a desperate effort to hold on to their homes. When people are wiped out financially and lose their home; they lose much more. They have lost their dignity. People who have worked their entire life to build up good credit are losing everything. Without jobs, homes, reputations, the stress on these good people and their families often becomes unbearable. Sociologists tell us that families should be viewed as interdependent within the larger society. In other words, the way the members of a family act at any given point in time does not occur in isolation from external events occurring in society. As the loss of family homes mounts, family units break apart, child abuse increases, and divorce rates go up. The legacy of this social stress is handed down for generations. A recent study, led by Marilyn Essex, professor in the Department of Psychiatry and director of the Life Stress & Human Development Lab of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, scientists gave questionnaires to hundreds of parents of young children, who were part of a years-long study. Questions were asked about depression, financial stress (\u201chow much trouble do you have paying monthly bills?\u201d), marital stress (\u201care you concerned about how much you argue and fight?\u201d), parenting stress (\u201cdo you often feel angry with your child?\u201d), and feeling overwhelmed (\u201cdo you feel pulled apart by all your obligations?\u201d). When the kids were 15, the scientists analyzed their DNA, using cells obtained by cheek swabs. What they found was shocking: there were hundreds of differences in the DNA of kids whose parents were in the top 20 percent of stress. In short, parental stress passed along to the children in a family literally changes a child\u2019s brain wiring. Stresses inside the home aren\u2019t the only symptom of the widespread crisis. We are losing entire neighborhoods, destroying an important part of the social fabric of our lives. A widely cited article, titled \u201cBroken Windows\u201d which appeared in the March 1982 issue of The Atlantic Monthly spawned a theory that, in urban areas, repairing real estate problems like broken windows or trash on the sidewalks while they are small keeps crime and vandalism from escalating in neighborhoods. The excess of foreclosed homes in our country serves as a daily reminder of this theory\u2019s depressing outcomes. As families are forced to abandon homes, vandals, squatters or undesirable renters move in, undermining family neighborhoods and tanking the values of the surrounding properties. More empty buildings mean less property tax revenues for cities and towns. And less revenue means fewer services, further accelerating the spiral of disrepair and destruction."",

                ""text"": ""Finding Our Inner Home. Home is so Sad. Home is so sad. It stays as it was left, Shaped to the comfort of the last to go As if to win them back. Instead, bereft Of anyone to please, it withers so, Having no heart to put aside the theft And turn again to what it started as, A joyous shot at how things ought to be, Long fallen wide. You can see how it was: Look at the pictures and the cutlery. The music in the piano stool. That vase. Time passes. We change. Home changes. Yet, the longing for home is a familiar theme across literature, poetry, drama, music and art. Sometimes, this might feel like an unmet need, one that is impossible to satisfy externally. People erect magnificent edifices as their homes, each bigger than the one next door. Yet there is often still a desire to seek further. What is the meaning of this desire? \u201cThis is because home, the real home we are seeking is something within ourselves and our own being. Symbolically, it is the center of the mandala. Home is connection with the centre of our own being; it is to be accepting of and at home with the deepest part of the self. But to find that, we must undertake an inner journey.\u201d\nFor this journey into the self, we might use meditation, religion, psychotherapy. This journey is surely one where we must discover for ourself; we are at the centre of the mandala. It is true that a home inside the self is what many people might be seeking when they come for psychotherapy. In this case, home means so much more than a place, a building, bricks and mortar. This home is related, not to physical space, but to psychic space. This home is about feelings, unrequited and unmet; it is about memories, some traumatic, some wonderful, yet gone forever. It is also about unresolved loss and grief, perhaps guilt at letting go of loved ones. It can also be related to fear of change and a need to live in the past. There might be a fear of letting go of objects and people that may once have felt secure. People with such issues often want to shed their \u2018baggage\u2019, as it is often described, but they feel unable to put it down, to feel relieved of their burdens, to relax into their internal space and their present lives. Perhaps it relates to a fear of growing older and of the responsibilities of adulthood. Just as some people hold onto material objects and hoard them, so we can do this in a psychical way, holding onto the past. We may hold onto both good and bad experiences, which prevent us moving forward in the present. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more difficult than saying goodbye to a house where you\u2019ve suffered.\u201d\nThe \u2018rubbish\u2019 that blocks the room in the image below may be compared to the psychological jumble of \u2018messy\u2019 feelings from the past that people bring into therapy. This past luggage blocks the person from moving on and really living, just as the junk is doing in the picture. Household of Compulsive Hoarders Donald Trung. Wikimedia Commons. The journey is one into acceptance of the reality of the self, past and present. For the home that has been longed for is a kind of displacement, a dislocation of feelings onto a fantasy, an idealisation. The longing for home is a longing for a place that has gone, that belongs in the past. Places change, the people in them change, yet often the idea of home remains unchanged, the same in our memory. Years later, one\u2019s childhood home will look different in reality. Some things will look smaller, other things bigger. Buildings may have altered, been destroyed, or extended, repainted, redesigned, just as we have redesigned ourselves, since. Loss of Home. Losing one\u2019s home can precipitate depression and fear. Such distressing experiences as eviction, fire, flood, demolition, divorce can all result in loss of one\u2019s home and all are traumatic and highly unsettling. Hopes and dreams are shattered, as is \u201cthe rhythm and comfort of everyday activities.\u201d (Thompson). We are a part of our environment and it is important to us. Moving house is one of the greatest stressors, along with death and divorce. Some people refuse to leave their home when it is threatened, even risking their lives."",

This stress could be because of many reasons such as:\nLosing a Job\nA person who is moving to a different house might feel stressful because of losing a job, which means that he or she would not be able to bear the expenses of living in a luxurious house and thus, have to move somewhere else, which means a change in schools and so much more. Sometimes a transfer would be the main cause for moving from the house and hence, there would be a stress of relocation. It is quite tough to relocate and thus, it is important for a person to take appropriate measures to avoid stress even when the situation is stressful. Moving to a new area\nFear of the unknown is quite stressful for some people and moving to a new area means that there would be a new neighborhood, new ambiance, and everything would be like starting from scratch. Buying a New House\nDue to an increase in family size, there might be a need to buy a new house or move to a bigger place to accommodate everyone quite well in the house and hence, it can be quite stressful for some people. There can be different situations, which can create stress for a person and it is important to keep the mind ready for dealing with such stress. Moving to a new place is already hectic.

                ""text"": ""If you\u2019re like most people, you probably associate home-buying with one thing: happiness. And buying a home is indeed a significant milestone in anyone\u2019s life. But what you may not know is that home-buying can also have a profound effect on your health and wellness. In this blog post, we\u2019ll take a closer look at how home-buying affects your well-being and offer some tips for making the process as stress-free as possible. Here are some things to keep in mind:\nIt Can Improve Your Health\nOn the other hand, buying a home can also positively affect your health. For example, purchasing a home can help you stay physically active, as you\u2019ll likely need to do some work around the house. It can also help you establish healthy routines and create a sense of stability in your life. In addition, owning a home can give you a sense of community and belonging. Studies have shown that people who live in neighborhoods with strong social ties tend to be healthier than those who don\u2019t. This is especially true if you can find a good neighborhood where you can find good friends. Another way home-buying can boost your health is that it can help you improve your immune system. When you have your own home, you\u2019re less likely to move around as much. And when you\u2019re not moving around as much, your immune system has a chance to strengthen. Buying a Home Can Be Stressful\nThere are many reasons why home-buying can be stressful. For one, some buyers are not eligible for low down payment loans. Others find it hard to find the right home that fits their needs and lifestyle. Stress is bad for your health and can lead to all sorts of problems, including heart disease, obesity, and insomnia. So it\u2019s important to take steps to reduce the amount of stress in your life. One way to do that is by buying a home. The process of buying a home can be stressful, but there are ways to reduce the stress. For example, you can hire a real estate agent who can help you with the process and take some of the burdens off your shoulders. You can also try to stay organized and keep track of all the paperwork involved in the buying process. It also makes sense that you do your research so you can find the right lender and the type of loan when buying a home for you and your family. This way, you can reduce the stress associated with home-buying. If you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, don\u2019t hesitate to ask for help from friends or family members \u2013 they may be able to offer some useful tips and advice. It Can Affect Your Mental Health\nFinally, it\u2019s important to note that buying a home can also affect your mental health. For example, if you\u2019re buying a home with a partner or spouse, the process can put a lot of stress on your relationship. In addition, if you\u2019re buying a home in a volatile housing market, it can be challenging to keep your emotions in check. There is also a need to make sure you are financially ready to make a significant investment before investing. Remember that your financial health can have a huge impact on your mental health. When financial problems begin to pile up, this can negatively affect your mental health. For instance, you initially thought that a low downpayment mortgage is the best choice since you get to buy a house with a little down payment. After closing the deal, you learn that you are better off using another mortgage plan since this will save you more money. Even if you make such a mistake, there is no need to drown in regret when there are other ways you can solve such an issue. For one, you can consider refinancing your mortgage. This option can offer several benefits, such as a lower interest rate and a longer repayment term. You may also be able to get a cash-out refinance, which will give you money to use for other purposes. If you\u2019re having trouble making your mortgage payments, you can also apply for a loan modification. This will allow you to change the terms of your mortgage so that they are more manageable for you. By focusing on solutions, you can give yourself better peace of mind and not let your mental health suffer when trying to achieve your home-buying dream. It is crucial that you also make sure that you are mentally healthy before starting the buying process. Ask the right questions and prepare to face the potential headaches you might encounter when buying your own home. This way, you can avoid any potential problems down the road."",

                ""text"": ""In the still, lonely hours before dawn, Karen Gaebelein sits in her living room chair staring out the window at the dark sky\u2014her thoughts racing, heart pounding. At age 56, Gaebelein, who lives in Broadview Heights, Ohio, is worried about the mortgage on her condo, her shrinking retirement savings, her questionable job future. Like millions of Americans, she is anxious, stressed by the troubling uncertainties of the faltering economy. And that stress is literally making her sick. Gaebelein, who has been unemployed for a year, has had trouble sleeping. Her blood pressure is high. She has bouts of depression. \u201cI forget to eat some days,\u201d says Gaebelein, who managed two offices of a credit union. \u201cBut once in a while I get a big bag of greasy fast food and a giant Hershey bar. I know I shouldn\u2019t, I know it\u2019s bad for me, but I can\u2019t help it.\u201d\nWhile a certain amount of stress can increase productivity and creativity, too much can be mentally and physically damaging. Not only does stress provoke negative behaviors such as bingeing on junk food, smoking and excessive drinking, it can also lead to ailments ranging from colds and flu to depression, high blood pressure and memory loss. Stress that persists over the years can exacerbate conditions such as heart disease, hardening of the arteries, autoimmune disease, diabetes and ulcers, experts say. Research indicates stress can also speed the aging process. \u201cStress rarely causes disease, but it creates conditions that make the body more vulnerable to disease. And if you\u2019re already sick or have a chronic illness, stress can make it worse,\u201d says Sheldon Cohen, a psychologist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. \u201cIts effects ... can be long-lasting.\u201d\nStress, he says, \u201cis the perception that you are facing demands that exceed your ability to cope.\u201d The demands can be physical\u2014say, if you\u2019re being pursued by a robber. Or they can be psychological\u2014worrying about a job or money. Today\u2019s economic meltdown is triggering widespread psychological stress, which feeds on uncertainty and dread. \u201cWe feel our control slipping and our lives growing more and more unpredictable,\u201d says Cohen. And the mind repeatedly mulls the same questions: What will happen next? How long will it go on? Will it get worse? Americans of all ages are living with the anxieties that a troubled economy brings. But some of the most stressed people, like Gaebelein, have been laid off in their last decade of work, with less chance of finding a new job and recouping financial losses. \u201cLosing your job at 50 or 60 is not good for your health,\u201d says William Gallo, a research scientist at Yale University\u2019s School of Medicine in New Haven. \u201cThere is compelling evidence that no matter who you compare the older job loser to, he or she does worse physically and mentally.\u201d\nGallo\u2019s studies, which tracked older people who lost their jobs after a plant closing, found not only that they had more symptoms of depression, but also that \u201ctheir risk of heart attack and stroke was more than doubled compared with people who did not lose their jobs.\u201d\nGallo says that job loss for people age 50 and older\u2014with its attendant anxiety\u2014should be considered an added risk factor for cardiovascular problems. (When study participants found other jobs, he says, the risk was greatly reduced.) Another finding: People who fear losing their jobs have more health problems than those who actually lost them, says Sarah A. Burgard, assistant professor of sociology at the University of Michigan. She and her team looked at 3,000 employed people under age 60 participating in two long-term studies and divided them into those who worried about losing their jobs and those who didn\u2019t. They found that over a two-year period people who felt chronically insecure about their jobs reported much worse overall health and were more depressed than those who actually lost their jobs. \u201cLiving with uncertainty, that\u2019s extremely damaging to your health,\u201d says Burgard."",

Each specialist brings their unique expertise, allowing for a more thorough evaluation of the child's development, behavior, and learning abilities. Here's how collaborating with various specialists can be beneficial:

1. **Psychologists**: They can conduct cognitive assessments, personality evaluations, and provide insights into the child's emotional and behavioral functioning. They might also offer therapy or counseling services.

2. **Speech-Language Pathologists**: They can assess and treat communication and language disorders, helping to identify if a child has expressive or receptive language difficulties, stuttering, or other speech-related issues.

3. **Occupational Therapists**: These professionals can evaluate a child's fine motor skills, sensory processing, and ability to perform daily activities. They can help address issues that impact a child's ability to function in everyday tasks.

4. **Physical Therapists**: They can assess a child's gross motor skills, muscle tone, balance, and coordination. They may provide interventions to improve physical abilities and mobility.

5. **Educational Specialists**: These professionals can evaluate a child's learning style, academic performance, and potential learning disabilities. They can recommend appropriate educational strategies and accommodations.

6. **Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists**: They can assess the child's mental health, diagnose any psychiatric disorders, and prescribe medication if necessary. They often work closely with psychologists and other therapists.

7. **Social Workers**: They can assess the child's social and emotional environment, including family dynamics, school relationships, and community resources. They can provide support and connect the family to necessary services.

8. **Neurologists**: In some cases, they may be consulted to assess any neurological conditions that could be affecting the child's development or behavior.

By integrating the insights and recommendations from these specialists, a more holistic picture of the child's needs and abilities is formed. This collaborative approach ensures that the assessment is comprehensive, addressing all aspects of the child's development and providing a foundation for creating an effective intervention plan. Parents and educators can use this information to support the child's growth and learning in the most appropriate and beneficial ways.","You are a helpful assistant.

### Context: Treatment Help, Part 3
Someone who has just spent some time with your child should be able to give you a few reactions or observations. It is completely reasonable to let evaluators know that you’d like a few minutes at the end of the session to get a sense of what they think. Always take notes. You may be more tense than you realize, and it may be hard to remember exactly what you did or didn’t hear. Ask to have unfamiliar terms spelled out and explained and request sources of information you can consult. If you’ve had a full multi-specialty evaluation done, consider making an appointment to come back in, sit down, and discuss the results. Keep a notebook. As time goes by, you will think of questions you want to ask, observations about your child that seem significant, ideas for further assessment or therapy. Write them all down in a notebook. There you can also make note of the specialists you see, the tests they do, the information they give. Jot down phone numbers of programs or specialists you learn about from other parents, as well as contact data for someone who isn’t that helpful now but may be in a few years. A notebook will help you track your child and your own understanding. It will also help you use your time with the specialists to ask the questions you’ve been wanting to bring up. Trust your instincts. Go into this process with an open mind but also with a healthy degree of skepticism. If someone tells you something that absolutely does not fit with your sense of your child, consider it objectively. If it’s nonsense, forget it. Don’t let someone who can’t answer questions to your satisfaction pursue a long-term therapeutic relationship with your child, no matter how grand or glorious his degrees or reception room. Don’t expect a “eureka” moment. We’ll say it again because it’s so important: By and large, quirky kids don’t fit neatly into diagnostic categories. The ongoing process of having your child assessed and considering different diagnoses can be valuable if it points the way to helping your child. Still, it’s probably not going to yield a single, illuminating conclusion when you find out what’s “really” going on. Some specialists or clinics will give almost anyone a diagnosis. If you look hard and long enough, you will come across someone who will pin a label on your child—perhaps because it’s the same label everybody gets at that particular clinic. Be especially wary of labels that carry immediate recommendations for expensive therapists. Don’t let anyone prey on your desire to help your child. It’s worth getting a second opinion or discussing the recommendation with your own pediatrician. Most of the professionals you will encounter as you look into assessment and diagnosis will be honorable. It must be said, however, that there is something of an industry out there in providing diagnoses and therapies to kids with developmental variations. This brings us, once again, to our preference for the academic medical center. Finally, don’t forget that the point of all this—the workup, the testing, the consideration of your child by multiple experts—is not to come up with the right label, the right name, the right answer on some cosmic medical-student exam. It’s to help your child—and to help you help your child. Adapted from Quirky Kids (Ballantine), by Perri Klass, M.D., and Eileen Costello, M.D. Reprinted with permission from Random House.

For that reason, they often make an oppositional youngster uncomfortable. The structure and level of aggrevation the child slips into this part of the assessment can be quite revealing and helpful in planning intervention. Two common examples of projectives are sentence completion tasks and standardized ink blot instruments. Diagnostic interview: A comprehensive interview with the child provides a wealth of strategic information. I happen to use a 155 question interview that I developed for this purpose (although it’s not always necessary to ask them all). The interview captures the youngster’s take on peer relationships, school functioning, factors of home and community and, of course, self. It samples their concerns in their terms, providing insight to areas where they would be most receptive to intervention. All this information is then complied into a comprehensive report that outlines the findings, provides a diagnosis (if there is one), and offers recommendations for intervention. The cost of an assessment like this ranges from a few hundred dollars to well over $1,000. Health insurance generally covers some, if not all, of the expense. Who can do these evaluations? Psychologists can, as well as anyone else trained and licensed or certified to do all components of the assessment. If your child’s oppositional and defiant behavior is causing them to have serious trouble progressing through school, you might ask the school to do an assessment. They have folks on staff who do this sort of thing all the time. They usually have at least one doctorate level psychologist on staff or as a consultant to help with the tougher challenges. Large counties often have a county psychological board (check the phone book) that can refer specialists who work with children. Also, a department of psychology or counseling of a nearby university (universities offer graduate training) might provide assistance or direction. In some cases, they may provide actual counseling or therapy services through their lab programs. Although the services are being provided by students, they are supervised, and they are usually motivated to do a good job. You don’t have much to lose, and the cost is minmal (like free, if they need kids). Keep in mind also that school counselors are required to maintain a resource list as part of their Crisis Response Plan. Ask them; they can probably help directly, or initiate a referral. Then, of course, there’s always the phone book. I believe it is best to find someone who specializes in children and adolescents. Who should do the counseling or therapy? For obvious reasons, it helps a lot if it is the same person who did the assessment. Rapport is already established, and there is no confusion regarding the interpretation of assessment results. Sometimes, however, this is not possible. I get a lot of calls and email asking about how to locate specialists in ODD in different states. Sorry, I’m not aware of any registry like this, although county psychological boards might list specialties. That would be a good place to start.

The latest education stories from the pages of Scholastic Teacher. Is the following a fair description of the kids who make up your classroom? Three of them struggle with math and four with reading, two are ELLs, one needs speech therapy, and two seem determined to never give you a moment of peace. As a teacher, you face a variety of hurdles, but that doesn’t mean you have to go it alone—your army of paraprofessionals, school counselors, speech therapists, reading specialists, and others are there to support you. Each of these specialists has a unique role and a common goal: to help your students, and you, succeed. Together, they are a fount of educational expertise. We asked a group of support people to share tips on working together with teachers. Here’s what they said. Their job: Provide support to students who have communication disorders that affect academic performance
How to leverage this relationship: Speech therapists work with kids who have articulation disorders—difficulty pronouncing words—as well as children who struggle with expressive language. They work on building these skills in one-on-one sessions but can help students in ways that directly apply to class assignments as well. “If a student has poor language skills and has an oral presentation coming up, I can help her—if I know about it,” says Christine Waddell, a speech-language pathologist at Edison Elementary School in Bow, Washington. Teachers who clue in Waddell to upcoming assignments that might present a challenge to certain students give her the opportunity to provide very specific, immediately applicable support. Close cooperation between classroom teachers and speech therapists is essential for students who are receiving support for an articulation disorder, Waddell points out. That’s because articulation disorders are intimately linked to difficulties with phonemic awareness, which also affects students’ reading ability. Because speech therapists have such limited time with students, however, they can’t provide as much phonemic support as students need. “I don’t necessarily treat phonemic awareness as a goal, because I only see a student one or two times a week for half an hour, and [I have to] treat the actual articulation disorder,” Waddell explains. Bonus tip: Classroom teachers can help students by playing a lot of word games in the classroom, says Waddell, even beyond the earliest grades. Their job: Provide extra support and instruction to struggling readers
How to leverage this relationship: “Reading is the hardest thing we learn how to do,” says Mary Martin,
a reading clinician who works with children at Rosa Parks Elementary School in Portland, Oregon. Students who struggle with reading may have difficulty with different aspects of the process, but the one thing they have in common is a lack of confidence. Carefully choose materials and activities that help these children avoid embarrassment and experience success, suggests Martin. “If you try to present a student with reading materials that are too complex, the student feels like a failure when he or she has trouble decoding or answering questions.” Regular check-ins with the child’s reading specialist can help you choose materials that are appropriately challenging. A reading specialist can also help you figure out how to adapt other elements of your curriculum to meet students’ needs. For instance, a fifth grader who isn’t reading at grade level will probably struggle with a spelling list based on words from books the class is reading. You can support the student’s learning (and build confidence) by providing spelling words that correspond with phonics rules the child is practicing with the specialist. “Try a list of words where sections of the words follow the same rule,” Martin says. “You don’t want to crush the student’s spirit with a spelling test; you want to help him build words.”
Their job: Provide instructional support to students under the direction and guidance of a licensed educator
How to leverage this relationship: Students form distinct relationships with people, and a paraprofessional who “clicks” with a student can share all kinds of ideas regarding how to best work with that child. Furthermore, because paraprofessionals bring their own unique backgrounds and skill sets into the classroom, they may see things you don’t and they may consider options you may not be aware of. “We might not have a certification or a degree, but we do have knowledge and history,” says Stephanie Dewberry, a paraprofessional who works with students on the autism spectrum at William M. Boyd Elementary in Atlanta.

You have a part in this, too — so take notes about a typical day with your child, including behaviors, language, and habits. Or videotape your child so that you have a visual record of where your child is, developmentally. Ask the professionals who work with your child to take some baseline data on her skills as a basis for comparison later. You should look for progress in three months, and again at six months. SP: What if, after following these suggestions, you're not satisfied with the help your child is getting? LeComer: Don't be afraid to approach the professionals working with your child to express your concerns. Asking questions or kindly stating your unhappiness with the level or type of services your child is receiving is absolutely warranted. Make sure, though, that your expectations are reasonable. Talk to other parents and professionals and educate yourself about your child's specific difficulties. This will help you discuss treatment more confidently. It's helpful to ask for a meeting in which all who work with your child can hear and discuss your concerns. Try to make a positive difference by being honest and helpful. But don't feel stuck in a situation that you believe is not going anywhere. You know your child best, and you're within your legal rights to make a change if you truly feel it's warranted. SP: How can parents help their child's self-esteem remain intact when there is a delay? LeComer: Examine your own attitude when in your child's presence. What does your body language and tone of voice convey to your child? Try to be your child's biggest cheerleader, and show him that you notice and appreciate his good deeds, his hard work, or his doing one more drill or task or test when he really didn't want to. Ask your child if you can be of assistance in some way. Don't make his therapy the focus of your family's daily life. It should be a component that will help your child participate more in the family, not the one thing your whole lives revolve around. Involve your child in your own interests and hobbies, and maybe help him find a hobby of his own. SP: How can parents help themselves through this challenge? LeComer: The doubt, frustration, and worry involved in having a child with developmental delays can affect your relationship with your spouse, your parenting skills, your patience, and your time with your other children. Parent groups, both in person and online, are great ways to meet other mothers and fathers, whether just to vent your concerns or to share tips on how to cope with the daily reality of your family's situation.

Treatment For Mental Health Disorders In Children
- Advice on managing distressing feelings and unwanted behaviour
- Family appointments to think about ways to resolve problems together
- Individual therapy for your child to help them understand their feelings and learn new ways of coping
- Medication prescribed by a child and adolescent psychiatrist
- Support to other professionals about how best they can help you and your child
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
A model that focuses on the relationship between thoughts, feelings and behaviours and explores practical and meaningful ways of working through current difficulties. The young person is understood as part of an organic and evolving system, for example the family. Change in one part of the system affects the system as a whole. Parent Training (Behavioural Therapy)
The therapist coaches parents in applying such strategies as rewarding positive behaviour, and responding to negative behaviour with clear consequences and time out . There is increasing evidence that medication can be a helpful addition to other treatments in some conditions e.g. severe depression, OCD, ADHD
Liaison with Other Agencies
It is often important to share information about the child with professionals e.g. teachers, Paediatricians or school nurses, so that everyone is working together. When A Child Is Referred To Us
- All referrals are discussed by the team before a first appointment is offered. An initial appointment may be with any of the team, depending on the problem being referred. - We would usually see the parents and child together as well as separately, as appropriate. - After this, further sessions with the same clinician may be offered if appropriate, or a more detailed assessment organised with other members of the team. - At the end of an assessment or piece of treatment, we would usually produce a report for the family, which can be shared with others e.g. GPs, with the family’s consent
Frequently Asked Questions
What mental health problems can children experience? Whilst serious mental illnesses are rare in children, emotional and behavioural problems are common, for example:
- Low mood
- Poor performance at school
These may be a response to stresses in a child’s environment, such as bereavement, illness in a family member, or divorce. The child may be suffering trauma, such as bullying. Or they may have a developmental disability such as a learning difficulty, autism or Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). Who are the different people that make up the CAMHS multidisciplinary team? - Child and adolescent psychiatrists – these are medical doctors who specialise in young people’s mental health, including the use of psychological and pharmacological therapy. They have specialist knowledge of child development, the links between physical and mental health, and how biological, psychological and social issues may combine to produce mental health problems. - Clinical psychologists – these have a comprehensive doctoral training in mental health and emotional wellbeing. They have detailed knowledge of patterns of thinking, feeling, relating and behaviour. They can complete assessments that can indicate issues that may affect learning (e.g. memory, attention). Clinical psychologists may specialise in particular therapies e.g. family therapy or Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). - Child and adolescent mental health nurses – these are qualified mental health nurses who specialise in working with young people with mental health problems and their families. They often have additional training in specific therapies e.g. family therapy, CBT, parent training, or psychodynamic approaches to treatment. They usually work in multidisciplinary teams, liaising closely with GPs, schools, and social workers, etc. Does my child need a child psychiatrist? It may not be necessary for your child to see a psychiatrist. All members of our team are highly qualified and experienced, and our nurse and psychologist are able to offer initial assessments. They are also experts in psychological treatments e.g. parenting support, family work, individual therapy. A psychiatrist may need to be involved if:
- There are concerns about serious mental illness, physical ill-health, or a complex developmental disorder. - Psychological approaches haven’t been sufficient and another treatment, such as medication, needs to be considered. Why does CAMHS share information with other professionals? We have a legal and professional duty to do what is in a child’s best interests, which includes sharing information when necessary. Children will often be experiencing difficulties in multiple settings e.g. school, home, social situations. Treatment may therefore combine clinic-based therapy, parents carrying out behaviour management strategies at home, and support from school. All the adults working together (e.g.

You can find many tips for effective advocacy, including tips for preparing for and discussing your concerns in meetings with school, in the section Raising a concern with school. In the meeting, or beforehand, you can draw the school’s attention to the relevant parts of the Disability Standards for Education as noted above (a direct link is provided in our Tools and Resources section). You can suggest that the school request advice on the right adjustments to meet your child’s learning needs from a relevant specialist in the regional DET office; for more information about these staff, see the relevant page in A guide to the support system. There are many ways in which these staff can help. Alternatively, if your child is already in contact with a therapist or other specialist who can attend an SSG meeting in a consultant role and provide similar input, suggest this to the school. This is provided for in the SSG Guidelines, which you can download from the DET website. For tips on how to effectively raise the suggestion with school, see the relevant page in Building a partnership with school. Challenges with communicating your child’s learning needs
The Commonwealth Disability Standard for Education require that your child’s school consult with you about your child’s disability, and its impacts on your child’s learning needs. This means that within the support system for students with disabilities, you have an important role to play in helping the school to understand your child’s disability and learning needs. So you can be confident about communicating this to the school, and sharing your knowledge of what will help your child to feel comfortable at school, and to reach their learning potential. The primary forum for consultation with you about your child’s disability and needs is through regular SSG meetings (compulsory if your child is on the Program for Students with Disabilities, and highly recommended by DET if not), and seeking your input to create an individual learning and support plan for your child. This is a plan that sets out their learning goals and adjustments to school programs to help them meet those goals. As explained in the section above, schools are legally required to make such adjustments, to give your child the opportunity to learn ‘on the same basis’ as students without a disability. SSG meetings and an individual learning and support plan are a central part of how schools are required to meet the needs of students with disabilities, and not an ‘add on’ or something that only occurs if your child is having problems. If your child’s school does not have these things in place for your child, you can ask for them. If needed, you can draw the school’s attention to relevant parts of the Disability Standards for Education, and the relevant DET policies such as the Guidelines for the Program for Students with Disabilities (if you child is on the PSD) and the Guidelines for Student Support Groups (relevant whether or not your child is on the PSD). - Find links in our Tools and resources
DET supplies a range of resources to schools, to help them assess a student’s learning strengths and needs, and gain insight into what kind of adjustments might be most effective in supporting their learning. This includes assessment tools, curriculum content and guidelines, professional development and expert advice from specialist in the DET regional office. You can refer the school to the relevant sections of Learning Together, or suggest that they request advice from a specialist DET staff member. Alternatively, if your child is already in contact with a therapist or other specialist who can attend an SSG meeting in a consultant role, suggest this to the school. - For tips on how to make the suggestion, see the relevant page in Building a partnership with school. - For information on all of the resources listed above, see the relevant pages in A guide to the support system and Education planning for your child. Challenging responses to input and ideas about your child’s learning needs. You have a key role to play in helping the school understand what adjustment your child might require; under the Disability Standards for Education, schools are legally required to consult with the parents and carers of all students with disabilities or additional needs about their child’s disability, and its impact on their learning needs. The most important forum for this is SSG meetings. You can draw the school’s attention to the relevant section of the Disability Standards for Education that outlines their legal obligation to consult with parents and carers, and suggest that they look at Learning Together for ideas about consulting with parents and carers. The support system for students with disabilities is designed to encourage input from DET and external specialists in meeting the needs of students with disabilities, and DET provides specialist staff who can do this in their regional offices.

Whilst we work in a number of different ways with children, adolescents and adults we promise to always be respectful, creative and find a way that works for you. Children and adolescents
We know that growing up can be hard sometimes. It can be helpful to talk to someone outside of your family if something is getting in the way of you enjoying life to the full. You might have been experiencing difficulties such as:
- Low self-esteem
- Low mood or feeling unhappy
- Getting worried, panicky or anxious
- Having problems in your family
- Living with a health condition
- Having to do something in a certain way or a certain number of times to make it feel okay
It would be helpful for one of us to initially meet with you to understand the difficulties you are facing. We would explore how it affects you at home, at school, with your friends and think about how they can best help you. It would also be helpful to meet one of your parents or guardians, and you could bring a friend if that would help you feel more comfortable. Together we would decide if it is best to work with you individually or if working with you and your parent/guardian would be better. It is possible for one of our Psychologists to meet individually with a young person as well as meeting individually with a parent; this can often be a helpful way to work. We understand that life can be challenging in a variety of different ways. Sometimes people need space to be heard and supported to understand and work through the difficulties they face. We hope that through this work, using a variety of models tailored to fit your needs, we can support you to maximise your strengths and resilience. We can work therapeutically with a range of difficulties including:
- Low mood
- Low self-esteem
- Work stress
- Health problems
- Relationship issues
- Overcoming traumatic events
- Grief and loss
We would meet with you to get an understanding of the difficulties and to assess your current situation. Based on this information we would think together about what therapeutic approach may be best suited to you. We would also be happy to meet with members of your family or a partner if that would be helpful. We understand that having a child can change your life and throw up challenges along the way that make it hard to feel like a “good enough parent”. We recognise that you are an expert about your child and your family situation. We invite you to bring that knowledge, together with our expertise in evidence-based strategies that have been shown to help parents and their children. In doing so we hope to create a winning team that helps you to move towards your goals. We acknowledge that there is not one “right” answer but we can work together to find strategies that fit you, your child and your family situation. We can work with a variety of difficulties including:
- Challenging behaviour and tantrums
- Sleeping and/or eating difficulties
- Relationship and communication difficulties
- Understanding and supporting children with learning or physical disabilities
We are experienced at working alongside and supervising other professionals. We understand that working in the helping professions can be stressful in itself and would be happy to meet with mental health professionals from a therapeutic perspective. We are able to offer:
- Supervision to mental health professionals or other clinical psychologists
- Therapies for trainee mental health workers
- Teaching, training and workshops
- Team building, managing changing circumstances, and building resilience for individuals, teams or groups.

As a parent with a child newly diagnosed with autism, it can be easy to ask yourself, “What do I do for my child diagnosed with autism?” This is a reaction that is to be expected and can be followed with overwhelming feelings and a lot of questions. The good news is that parents don’t have to let an autism diagnosis intimidate or overwhelm them because they are not alone on this journey. Families can find a lot of support, resources, and services through talking to their child’s doctor and team of therapists, teachers at the child’s school, as well as other parents in the autism community. Having and maintaining communication between the child’s team, as well as support groups will prove to be helpful. Your child’s team could consist of the child’s doctor or developmental pediatrician, occupational therapist, speech language pathologist, as well as other mental and physical health professionals, and special education or other services through your child’s school. This team is helpful and does best when working together with the parents and child when setting goals and putting services into place. Steps after receiving your child’s diagnosis of autism
Families play a large role for autistic children. They have been the ones that have witnessed the differing and sometimes difficult to understand behaviors, noticed differences in the child’s development, they know the child’s strengths, and have been there when they learn new skills and language or communication development. The child’s parents will meet with the team and they will discuss the child’s development, strengths, and goals to work towards. The parents will also receive information on community support and services that are available for the newly diagnosed autistic child. The meetings are as frequent as is decided by the parents and team. This is a great time for any questions or concerns to be brought out and discussed. Depending on when your child was diagnosed, there are early intervention services available to support the early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders. These help jump start your child’s therapies and other services that they may qualify for. When plans and goals are figured, they are then put together to form a very individualized plan for your child. Each part and therapy is discussed at the initial meeting and discussed at each decided upon meeting afterward. There may be a need for an individual evaluation following the full assessment that your child already had to receive a diagnosis of autism. These individual evaluations would depend on the practitioner, for instance there may be an assessment for speech therapy, behavioral therapy, or occupational therapy to get a baseline for the therapist to develop a specialized path for your child’s development and growth in that area, based on the goals discussed. What can I do to help my child? There is a lot that parents can do when it comes to helping their autistic child through their therapies and services. Parents learn a lot either through the observation of therapy, or through more hands-on activities like pretend play, using sign language to build communication skills, as well as being there during real life social situations being their child’s support. Attending autism parents support groups, reading quality books about autism spectrum disorder written by parents, autistic individuals, and professionals, and using the skills you have gained through observation and parent education that can be available through services like Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) or other therapies can help build your confidence, while helping your child. The members on your child’s team should be able to answer questions and offer specific suggestions that would benefit your child and family. Through my experience, therapists strongly suggest that parents continue what the child is learning during a session at home and will generally give the parent and/or family the tools and support to help the process.

There are many different ways that parents can find support so that they have the skills, or can start building the skills to best help their child’s development. It can be very individualized, depending on the specifics of your child’s diagnosis, or it can be broad and cover a spectrum, depending on what the parent is looking for. There are many different kinds of support groups for parents, siblings, and families of individuals diagnosed with autism.

Assessment is dependent upon our observations of the children. Anne O’Brien, an experienced teacher and headteacher of young children, explores how we can use the observations we have made to inform the next stage of our planning. - Observing the children as they play and learn
- Talking with children and finding out what they know, can do and how they feel
- Analysing and interpreting what you see and hear. Assessment does not stand alone. It transcends all teaching and learning opportunities. It is an important starting point. When you know what the children can do and know, you can decide what they need next. Assessment can enable you to improve your own professional skills. As you assess the children you will discover what is successful and what doesn’t work. You will be able to identify tasks, which allowed real growth and development of skills, and through analysis you will be able to identify the factors, which contributed to this success – and use them again to inform future planning. You will become a more skilled professional. Three key questions to keep in mind are:
- Why do we need it? - What can it tell us? - How can we use it? - supports children’s learning
- affects future planning
- contributes to professional development
- amend your short term planning
- inform your medium term and long term plans
- adapt activities to suit the needs of individual children
- modify tasks to match children’s known abilities
- provide children with positive and specific feedback as they work and play. The rest of this article provides a route into how effective observation within your setting can raise the level of professionalism amongst your staff. Staff need to be trained in how to observe, how to interpret
their observations and how to use the information they have acquired to inform their future planning and activities. We all know about the importance of observing children as they play, learn and interact with others. We see how they learn as we watch them. We notice the way they approach a problem. We can identify those who methodically try different ways or repeat their actions after a failed attempt. We identify those who give up on the first attempt if it’s not successful or those who are unwilling to try something new. We see what they learn. We can spot steps towards the learning of skills and knowledge. We can see aspects that are proving too tricky at this moment. So what! If your observations stop there, it has all been a waste of your time. ‘Observations are not an end in themselves but a tool for gathering information about a child.’ (Kay 2005, p90)
What happens to your observations? Are they planned, or are your staff simply looking around and chancing upon a child achieving or struggling? If observations are recorded, how is that information then used? Here are some questions, which will help you to focus on what is happening in your setting. They could be a starting point for discussion with your team as you develop your assessment practice. Are observations recorded as soon as possible? - Carry a notebook in your pocket and jot down your observations ready to be recorded later onto your formal documents
- Keep a card index file – one child per card – in your room and jot down notes
- Carry Post-it notes to jot down observations to be transferred to formal documents later
How often do you observe each child? - Put the names of the children for whom you are the key worker in your notebook, one per page, at the start of each day. Choose two or three of your children per day and observe them all on a rota system. - Allocate one member of the team per session to carry out observations of all of the children at a particular activity, and share the information later. - Put an agreed number of cards in the front of a file index box at the start of each day, and observe those for whom you are the key worker, returning their cards to the back of the box at the end of the day. - Make a weekly check to ensure all children are being observed regularly. Do you observe children at a variety of activities over time? - Focus on one activity per session, having set up a specific activity for this. - Change the focus activity each session so that you cover child-led, adult-led, free and organised, indoor and outdoor, individual and group activities over the week. Are all staff members involved in observations, discussion and planning? - Observations, planning and learning will be more effective if all members of your team are involved. Do you discuss your observations with your colleagues? - Think about your plans: at the end of the week look through your observations together and evaluate the planned activities in relation to your observations. Did the activities allow the children to gain the skills or the knowledge that you intended?

Finding Psychological Help for Your Child
Locating a Therapist
The way you find a therapist, psychologist or other mental health professional can be crucial to your child’s success, said Dale Masi, a professor at the University of Maryland graduate school for social work. In her recent book “Shrink to Fit” (Health Communications, $10.95), she suggests seeking referrals from mental health workers you know, your primary physician and people in support groups dealing with the same issues. “You know, most people find a therapist in the telephone book,” she said. “I would not necessarily recommend that.”
Garnette strongly suggests that parents check with their insurance company or HMO for guidelines about what is covered and for how long. When in doubt about a practitioner, she would turn to a trusted friend. “Your best bet is a friend who operates very much like you do,” Garnette said. Once you have a few names, Masi suggests meeting with the doctors without your child. Go armed with a list of questions and get answers about their education, experience, expertise with children, and the specific issues or diagnoses affecting your child. “You should not feel uncomfortable interviewing a therapist,” Masi said. And think about the office atmosphere. Masi would have doubts about a doctor who claimed to specialize in children, but who had no toys or child-sized furniture in the waiting room. “Definitely look for an expertise in treating children,” Garnette said. “Children are not all little adults. A lot of it has to do with how you just click with a person because it’s so personal.”
Garnette would also seek someone with a few years’ experience because “you do get better with practice.”
Leman also recommends finding a therapist who wants to help the child, not finish the payments on his yacht. “Find someone who wants to get rid of you,” he said. “If they’re good, they want the child to be well and take off on his own.”
He would also check with the local mental health society or board for any misconduct cases against a professional you’re considering. Don’t expect to rely on one psychiatrist, psychologist or therapist alone. Many cases are best helped by a network of parents and professionals working together on different aspects of the child’s therapy. As a result, Masi suggests asking about affiliations when interviewing the initial professional. “If she’s not a psychiatrist, ask what psychiatrist she works with and if that person is a child psychiatrist,” Masi said. For many cases, experts recommend a comprehensive plan, taking in a few professionals. For example, a plan for a child showing severe attention problems in school might include talk therapy with a family therapist, participation in a social-skills group and drug management through a psychiatrist. “Ideally, you want a situation in which all those people talk to each other and that ‘s really difficult,” Garnette said. The situation is made more difficult by current practices in health management organizations and insurers that often have definite guidelines regarding length of treatment and the types of professional care covered. On average, Garnette says, managed-care companies will pay for 10 to 15 sessions, but it’s often fewer. In advocating for her son, she once threatened a vice president of her HMO with a lawsuit before the company agreed to extra care. “They want to cure everyone in four sessions and it’s just not possible,” Garnette said. And ask up front how long the therapist expects his or her work with your child to continue. Even a rough estimate can help you plan for expenses and the effect on the child and the family, Masi says. Traumatic situations don’t always allow for weeks of planning. However, some don’t require a therapist either, Leman says. In the case of a child grieving after a family member’s death, Leman encourages parents to “give themselves more credit.”
“Why would a kid want to see a stranger if they’re grieving?” he asked. “Share your imperfect self with your child. It’s healthy for them to see you cry, pray, be concerned. That’s OK.”
Garnette cautions parents to remain involved in the therapy process so they will see if changes are needed. Her son went through five psychiatrists before he found one that seemed a perfect match. “It’s worth it when you get there,” Garnette said. “Your gut feeling is often right.”
Guinness, M. (2016).","[{'passage': ""Treatment Help, Part 3\nSomeone who has just spent some time with your child should be able to give you a few reactions or observations. It is completely reasonable to let evaluators know that you’d like a few minutes at the end of the session to get a sense of what they think. Always take notes. You may be more tense than you realize, and it may be hard to remember exactly what you did or didn’t hear. Ask to have unfamiliar terms spelled out and explained and request sources of information you can consult. If you’ve had a full multi-specialty evaluation done, consider making an appointment to come back in, sit down, and discuss the results. Keep a notebook. As time goes by, you will think of questions you want to ask, observations about your child that seem significant, ideas for further assessment or therapy. Write them all down in a notebook. There you can also make note of the specialists you see, the tests they do, the information they give. Jot down phone numbers of programs or specialists you learn about from other parents, as well as contact data for someone who isn’t that helpful now but may be in a few years. A notebook will help you track your child and your own understanding. It will also help you use your time with the specialists to ask the questions you’ve been wanting to bring up. Trust your instincts. Go into this process with an open mind but also with a healthy degree of skepticism. If someone tells you something that absolutely does not fit with your sense of your child, consider it objectively. If it’s nonsense, forget it. Don’t let someone who can’t answer questions to your satisfaction pursue a long-term therapeutic relationship with your child, no matter how grand or glorious his degrees or reception room. Don’t expect a “eureka” moment. We’ll say it again because it’s so important: By and large, quirky kids don’t fit neatly into diagnostic categories. The ongoing process of having your child assessed and considering different diagnoses can be valuable if it points the way to helping your child. Still, it’s probably not going to yield a single, illuminating conclusion when you find out what’s “really” going on. Some specialists or clinics will give almost anyone a diagnosis. If you look hard and long enough, you will come across someone who will pin a label on your child—perhaps because it’s the same label everybody gets at that particular clinic. Be especially wary of labels that carry immediate recommendations for expensive therapists. Don’t let anyone prey on your desire to help your child. It’s worth getting a second opinion or discussing the recommendation with your own pediatrician. Most of the professionals you will encounter as you look into assessment and diagnosis will be honorable. It must be said, however, that there is something of an industry out there in providing diagnoses and therapies to kids with developmental variations. This brings us, once again, to our preference for the academic medical center. Finally, don’t forget that the point of all this—the workup, the testing, the consideration of your child by multiple experts—is not to come up with the right label, the right name, the right answer on some cosmic medical-student exam. It’s to help your child—and to help you help your child. Adapted from Quirky Kids (Ballantine), by Perri Klass, M.D., and Eileen Costello, M.D. Reprinted with permission from Random House.

The structure and level of aggrevation the child slips into this part of the assessment can be quite revealing and helpful in planning intervention. Two common examples of projectives are sentence completion tasks and standardized ink blot instruments. Diagnostic interview: A comprehensive interview with the child provides a wealth of strategic information. I happen to use a 155 question interview that I developed for this purpose (although it’s not always necessary to ask them all). The interview captures the youngster’s take on peer relationships, school functioning, factors of home and community and, of course, self. It samples their concerns in their terms, providing insight to areas where they would be most receptive to intervention. All this information is then complied into a comprehensive report that outlines the findings, provides a diagnosis (if there is one), and offers recommendations for intervention. The cost of an assessment like this ranges from a few hundred dollars to well over $1,000. Health insurance generally covers some, if not all, of the expense. Who can do these evaluations? Psychologists can, as well as anyone else trained and licensed or certified to do all components of the assessment. If your child’s oppositional and defiant behavior is causing them to have serious trouble progressing through school, you might ask the school to do an assessment. They have folks on staff who do this sort of thing all the time. They usually have at least one doctorate level psychologist on staff or as a consultant to help with the tougher challenges. Large counties often have a county psychological board (check the phone book) that can refer specialists who work with children. Also, a department of psychology or counseling of a nearby university (universities offer graduate training) might provide assistance or direction. In some cases, they may provide actual counseling or therapy services through their lab programs. Although the services are being provided by students, they are supervised, and they are usually motivated to do a good job. You don’t have much to lose, and the cost is minmal (like free, if they need kids). Keep in mind also that school counselors are required to maintain a resource list as part of their Crisis Response Plan. Ask them; they can probably help directly, or initiate a referral. Then, of course, there’s always the phone book. I believe it is best to find someone who specializes in children and adolescents. Who should do the counseling or therapy? For obvious reasons, it helps a lot if it is the same person who did the assessment. Rapport is already established, and there is no confusion regarding the interpretation of assessment results. Sometimes, however, this is not possible. I get a lot of calls and email asking about how to locate specialists in ODD in different states. Sorry, I’m not aware of any registry like this, although county psychological boards might list specialties. That would be a good place to start.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:bf776d14-d370-416f-8a38-a212eb6bbf28>']}, {'passage': 'The latest education stories from the pages of Scholastic Teacher. Is the following a fair description of the kids who make up your classroom? Three of them struggle with math and four with reading, two are ELLs, one needs speech therapy, and two seem determined to never give you a moment of peace. As a teacher, you face a variety of hurdles, but that doesn’t mean you have to go it alone—your army of paraprofessionals, school counselors, speech therapists, reading specialists, and others are there to support you. Each of these specialists has a unique role and a common goal: to help your students, and you, succeed. Together, they are a fount of educational expertise. We asked a group of support people to share tips on working together with teachers. Here’s what they said. Their job: Provide support to students who have communication disorders that affect academic performance\nHow to leverage this relationship: Speech therapists work with kids who have articulation disorders—difficulty pronouncing words—as well as children who struggle with expressive language. They work on building these skills in one-on-one sessions but can help students in ways that directly apply to class assignments as well. “If a student has poor language skills and has an oral presentation coming up, I can help her—if I know about it,” says Christine Waddell, a speech-language pathologist at Edison Elementary School in Bow, Washington. Teachers who clue in Waddell to upcoming assignments that might present a challenge to certain students give her the opportunity to provide very specific, immediately applicable support. Close cooperation between classroom teachers and speech therapists is essential for students who are receiving support for an articulation disorder, Waddell points out. That’s because articulation disorders are intimately linked to difficulties with phonemic awareness, which also affects students’ reading ability. Because speech therapists have such limited time with students, however, they can’t provide as much phonemic support as students need. “I don’t necessarily treat phonemic awareness as a goal, because I only see a student one or two times a week for half an hour, and [I have to] treat the actual articulation disorder,” Waddell explains. Bonus tip: Classroom teachers can help students by playing a lot of word games in the classroom, says Waddell, even beyond the earliest grades. Their job: Provide extra support and instruction to struggling readers\nHow to leverage this relationship: “Reading is the hardest thing we learn how to do,” says Mary Martin,\na reading clinician who works with children at Rosa Parks Elementary School in Portland, Oregon. Students who struggle with reading may have difficulty with different aspects of the process, but the one thing they have in common is a lack of confidence. Carefully choose materials and activities that help these children avoid embarrassment and experience success, suggests Martin. “If you try to present a student with reading materials that are too complex, the student feels like a failure when he or she has trouble decoding or answering questions.” Regular check-ins with the child’s reading specialist can help you choose materials that are appropriately challenging. A reading specialist can also help you figure out how to adapt other elements of your curriculum to meet students’ needs. For instance, a fifth grader who isn’t reading at grade level will probably struggle with a spelling list based on words from books the class is reading. You can support the student’s learning (and build confidence) by providing spelling words that correspond with phonics rules the child is practicing with the specialist. “Try a list of words where sections of the words follow the same rule,” Martin says. “You don’t want to crush the student’s spirit with a spelling test; you want to help him build words.”\nTheir job: Provide instructional support to students under the direction and guidance of a licensed educator\nHow to leverage this relationship: Students form distinct relationships with people, and a paraprofessional who “clicks” with a student can share all kinds of ideas regarding how to best work with that child. Furthermore, because paraprofessionals bring their own unique backgrounds and skill sets into the classroom, they may see things you don’t and they may consider options you may not be aware of. “We might not have a certification or a degree, but we do have knowledge and history,” says Stephanie Dewberry, a paraprofessional who works with students on the autism spectrum at William M. Boyd Elementary in Atlanta.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:65ca45b2-2eaa-4fdc-9ef7-a30715c47327>']}, {'passage': ""You have a part in this, too — so take notes about a typical day with your child, including behaviors, language, and habits. Or videotape your child so that you have a visual record of where your child is, developmentally. Ask the professionals who work with your child to take some baseline data on her skills as a basis for comparison later. You should look for progress in three months, and again at six months. SP: What if, after following these suggestions, you're not satisfied with the help your child is getting? LeComer: Don't be afraid to approach the professionals working with your child to express your concerns. Asking questions or kindly stating your unhappiness with the level or type of services your child is receiving is absolutely warranted. Make sure, though, that your expectations are reasonable. Talk to other parents and professionals and educate yourself about your child's specific difficulties. This will help you discuss treatment more confidently. It's helpful to ask for a meeting in which all who work with your child can hear and discuss your concerns. Try to make a positive difference by being honest and helpful. But don't feel stuck in a situation that you believe is not going anywhere. You know your child best, and you're within your legal rights to make a change if you truly feel it's warranted. SP: How can parents help their child's self-esteem remain intact when there is a delay? LeComer: Examine your own attitude when in your child's presence. What does your body language and tone of voice convey to your child? Try to be your child's biggest cheerleader, and show him that you notice and appreciate his good deeds, his hard work, or his doing one more drill or task or test when he really didn't want to. Ask your child if you can be of assistance in some way. Don't make his therapy the focus of your family's daily life. It should be a component that will help your child participate more in the family, not the one thing your whole lives revolve around. Involve your child in your own interests and hobbies, and maybe help him find a hobby of his own. SP: How can parents help themselves through this challenge? LeComer: The doubt, frustration, and worry involved in having a child with developmental delays can affect your relationship with your spouse, your parenting skills, your patience, and your time with your other children. Parent groups, both in person and online, are great ways to meet other mothers and fathers, whether just to vent your concerns or to share tips on how to cope with the daily reality of your family's situation."", 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:b4ed7f3f-1950-44b3-9edf-fdb5edfe06dc>']}, {'passage': 'Treatment For Mental Health Disorders In Children\n- Advice on managing distressing feelings and unwanted behaviour\n- Family appointments to think about ways to resolve problems together\n- Individual therapy for your child to help them understand their feelings and learn new ways of coping\n- Medication prescribed by a child and adolescent psychiatrist\n- Support to other professionals about how best they can help you and your child\nCognitive Behavioural Therapy\nA model that focuses on the relationship between thoughts, feelings and behaviours and explores practical and meaningful ways of working through current difficulties.

There is increasing evidence that medication can be a helpful addition to other treatments in some conditions e.g. severe depression, OCD, ADHD\nLiaison with Other Agencies\nIt is often important to share information about the child with professionals e.g. teachers, Paediatricians or school nurses, so that everyone is working together. When A Child Is Referred To Us\n- All referrals are discussed by the team before a first appointment is offered. An initial appointment may be with any of the team, depending on the problem being referred. - We would usually see the parents and child together as well as separately, as appropriate. - After this, further sessions with the same clinician may be offered if appropriate, or a more detailed assessment organised with other members of the team. - At the end of an assessment or piece of treatment, we would usually produce a report for the family, which can be shared with others e.g. GPs, with the family’s consent\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat mental health problems can children experience? Whilst serious mental illnesses are rare in children, emotional and behavioural problems are common, for example:\n- Low mood\n- Poor performance at school\nThese may be a response to stresses in a child’s environment, such as bereavement, illness in a family member, or divorce. The child may be suffering trauma, such as bullying. Or they may have a developmental disability such as a learning difficulty, autism or Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). Who are the different people that make up the CAMHS multidisciplinary team? - Child and adolescent psychiatrists – these are medical doctors who specialise in young people’s mental health, including the use of psychological and pharmacological therapy. They have specialist knowledge of child development, the links between physical and mental health, and how biological, psychological and social issues may combine to produce mental health problems. - Clinical psychologists – these have a comprehensive doctoral training in mental health and emotional wellbeing. They have detailed knowledge of patterns of thinking, feeling, relating and behaviour. They can complete assessments that can indicate issues that may affect learning (e.g. memory, attention). Clinical psychologists may specialise in particular therapies e.g. family therapy or Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). - Child and adolescent mental health nurses – these are qualified mental health nurses who specialise in working with young people with mental health problems and their families. They often have additional training in specific therapies e.g. family therapy, CBT, parent training, or psychodynamic approaches to treatment. They usually work in multidisciplinary teams, liaising closely with GPs, schools, and social workers, etc. Does my child need a child psychiatrist? It may not be necessary for your child to see a psychiatrist. All members of our team are highly qualified and experienced, and our nurse and psychologist are able to offer initial assessments. They are also experts in psychological treatments e.g. parenting support, family work, individual therapy. A psychiatrist may need to be involved if:\n- There are concerns about serious mental illness, physical ill-health, or a complex developmental disorder. - Psychological approaches haven’t been sufficient and another treatment, such as medication, needs to be considered. Why does CAMHS share information with other professionals? We have a legal and professional duty to do what is in a child’s best interests, which includes sharing information when necessary. Children will often be experiencing difficulties in multiple settings e.g. school, home, social situations. Treatment may therefore combine clinic-based therapy, parents carrying out behaviour management strategies at home, and support from school.

In the meeting, or beforehand, you can draw the school’s attention to the relevant parts of the Disability Standards for Education as noted above (a direct link is provided in our Tools and Resources section). You can suggest that the school request advice on the right adjustments to meet your child’s learning needs from a relevant specialist in the regional DET office; for more information about these staff, see the relevant page in A guide to the support system. There are many ways in which these staff can help. Alternatively, if your child is already in contact with a therapist or other specialist who can attend an SSG meeting in a consultant role and provide similar input, suggest this to the school. This is provided for in the SSG Guidelines, which you can download from the DET website. For tips on how to effectively raise the suggestion with school, see the relevant page in Building a partnership with school. Challenges with communicating your child’s learning needs\nThe Commonwealth Disability Standard for Education require that your child’s school consult with you about your child’s disability, and its impacts on your child’s learning needs. This means that within the support system for students with disabilities, you have an important role to play in helping the school to understand your child’s disability and learning needs. So you can be confident about communicating this to the school, and sharing your knowledge of what will help your child to feel comfortable at school, and to reach their learning potential. The primary forum for consultation with you about your child’s disability and needs is through regular SSG meetings (compulsory if your child is on the Program for Students with Disabilities, and highly recommended by DET if not), and seeking your input to create an individual learning and support plan for your child. This is a plan that sets out their learning goals and adjustments to school programs to help them meet those goals. As explained in the section above, schools are legally required to make such adjustments, to give your child the opportunity to learn ‘on the same basis’ as students without a disability. SSG meetings and an individual learning and support plan are a central part of how schools are required to meet the needs of students with disabilities, and not an ‘add on’ or something that only occurs if your child is having problems. If your child’s school does not have these things in place for your child, you can ask for them. If needed, you can draw the school’s attention to relevant parts of the Disability Standards for Education, and the relevant DET policies such as the Guidelines for the Program for Students with Disabilities (if you child is on the PSD) and the Guidelines for Student Support Groups (relevant whether or not your child is on the PSD). - Find links in our Tools and resources\nDET supplies a range of resources to schools, to help them assess a student’s learning strengths and needs, and gain insight into what kind of adjustments might be most effective in supporting their learning. This includes assessment tools, curriculum content and guidelines, professional development and expert advice from specialist in the DET regional office. You can refer the school to the relevant sections of Learning Together, or suggest that they request advice from a specialist DET staff member. Alternatively, if your child is already in contact with a therapist or other specialist who can attend an SSG meeting in a consultant role, suggest this to the school. - For tips on how to make the suggestion, see the relevant page in Building a partnership with school. - For information on all of the resources listed above, see the relevant pages in A guide to the support system and Education planning for your child. Challenging responses to input and ideas about your child’s learning needs. You have a key role to play in helping the school understand what adjustment your child might require; under the Disability Standards for Education, schools are legally required to consult with the parents and carers of all students with disabilities or additional needs about their child’s disability, and its impact on their learning needs. The most important forum for this is SSG meetings. You can draw the school’s attention to the relevant section of the Disability Standards for Education that outlines their legal obligation to consult with parents and carers, and suggest that they look at Learning Together for ideas about consulting with parents and carers.

The good news is that parents don’t have to let an autism diagnosis intimidate or overwhelm them because they are not alone on this journey. Families can find a lot of support, resources, and services through talking to their child’s doctor and team of therapists, teachers at the child’s school, as well as other parents in the autism community. Having and maintaining communication between the child’s team, as well as support groups will prove to be helpful. Your child’s team could consist of the child’s doctor or developmental pediatrician, occupational therapist, speech language pathologist, as well as other mental and physical health professionals, and special education or other services through your child’s school. This team is helpful and does best when working together with the parents and child when setting goals and putting services into place. Steps after receiving your child’s diagnosis of autism\nFamilies play a large role for autistic children. They have been the ones that have witnessed the differing and sometimes difficult to understand behaviors, noticed differences in the child’s development, they know the child’s strengths, and have been there when they learn new skills and language or communication development. The child’s parents will meet with the team and they will discuss the child’s development, strengths, and goals to work towards. The parents will also receive information on community support and services that are available for the newly diagnosed autistic child. The meetings are as frequent as is decided by the parents and team. This is a great time for any questions or concerns to be brought out and discussed. Depending on when your child was diagnosed, there are early intervention services available to support the early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders. These help jump start your child’s therapies and other services that they may qualify for. When plans and goals are figured, they are then put together to form a very individualized plan for your child. Each part and therapy is discussed at the initial meeting and discussed at each decided upon meeting afterward. There may be a need for an individual evaluation following the full assessment that your child already had to receive a diagnosis of autism. These individual evaluations would depend on the practitioner, for instance there may be an assessment for speech therapy, behavioral therapy, or occupational therapy to get a baseline for the therapist to develop a specialized path for your child’s development and growth in that area, based on the goals discussed. What can I do to help my child? There is a lot that parents can do when it comes to helping their autistic child through their therapies and services. Parents learn a lot either through the observation of therapy, or through more hands-on activities like pretend play, using sign language to build communication skills, as well as being there during real life social situations being their child’s support. Attending autism parents support groups, reading quality books about autism spectrum disorder written by parents, autistic individuals, and professionals, and using the skills you have gained through observation and parent education that can be available through services like Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) or other therapies can help build your confidence, while helping your child. The members on your child’s team should be able to answer questions and offer specific suggestions that would benefit your child and family. Through my experience, therapists strongly suggest that parents continue what the child is learning during a session at home and will generally give the parent and/or family the tools and support to help the process. That is one of the reasons that parents, caregivers, individuals, and the team come together to create the goals that will shape the therapies and services for the growth and success of the individual.

There are many different ways that parents can find support so that they have the skills, or can start building the skills to best help their child’s development. It can be very individualized, depending on the specifics of your child’s diagnosis, or it can be broad and cover a spectrum, depending on what the parent is looking for. There are many different kinds of support groups for parents, siblings, and families of individuals diagnosed with autism.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:64d38e87-2b11-4e67-8087-c18cb4f5e4c7>']}, {'passage': 'Assessment is dependent upon our observations of the children. Anne O’Brien, an experienced teacher and headteacher of young children, explores how we can use the observations we have made to inform the next stage of our planning. - Observing the children as they play and learn\n- Talking with children and finding out what they know, can do and how they feel\n- Analysing and interpreting what you see and hear. Assessment does not stand alone. It transcends all teaching and learning opportunities. It is an important starting point. When you know what the children can do and know, you can decide what they need next. Assessment can enable you to improve your own professional skills. As you assess the children you will discover what is successful and what doesn’t work. You will be able to identify tasks, which allowed real growth and development of skills, and through analysis you will be able to identify the factors, which contributed to this success – and use them again to inform future planning. You will become a more skilled professional. Three key questions to keep in mind are:\n- Why do we need it? - What can it tell us? - How can we use it? - supports children’s learning\n- affects future planning\n- contributes to professional development\n- amend your short term planning\n- inform your medium term and long term plans\n- adapt activities to suit the needs of individual children\n- modify tasks to match children’s known abilities\n- provide children with positive and specific feedback as they work and play. The rest of this article provides a route into how effective observation within your setting can raise the level of professionalism amongst your staff. Staff need to be trained in how to observe, how to interpret\ntheir observations and how to use the information they have acquired to inform their future planning and activities. We all know about the importance of observing children as they play, learn and interact with others. We see how they learn as we watch them. We notice the way they approach a problem. We can identify those who methodically try different ways or repeat their actions after a failed attempt. We identify those who give up on the first attempt if it’s not successful or those who are unwilling to try something new. We see what they learn. We can spot steps towards the learning of skills and knowledge. We can see aspects that are proving too tricky at this moment. So what! If your observations stop there, it has all been a waste of your time. ‘Observations are not an end in themselves but a tool for gathering information about a child.’ (Kay 2005, p90)\nWhat happens to your observations? Are they planned, or are your staff simply looking around and chancing upon a child achieving or struggling? If observations are recorded, how is that information then used? Here are some questions, which will help you to focus on what is happening in your setting. They could be a starting point for discussion with your team as you develop your assessment practice. Are observations recorded as soon as possible? - Carry a notebook in your pocket and jot down your observations ready to be recorded later onto your formal documents\n- Keep a card index file – one child per card – in your room and jot down notes\n- Carry Post-it notes to jot down observations to be transferred to formal documents later\nHow often do you observe each child? - Put the names of the children for whom you are the key worker in your notebook, one per page, at the start of each day. Choose two or three of your children per day and observe them all on a rota system. - Allocate one member of the team per session to carry out observations of all of the children at a particular activity, and share the information later. - Put an agreed number of cards in the front of a file index box at the start of each day, and observe those for whom you are the key worker, returning their cards to the back of the box at the end of the day. - Make a weekly check to ensure all children are being observed regularly. Do you observe children at a variety of activities over time? - Focus on one activity per session, having set up a specific activity for this. - Change the focus activity each session so that you cover child-led, adult-led, free and organised, indoor and outdoor, individual and group activities over the week. Are all staff members involved in observations, discussion and planning? - Observations, planning and learning will be more effective if all members of your team are involved. Do you discuss your observations with your colleagues? - Think about your plans: at the end of the week look through your observations together and evaluate the planned activities in relation to your observations. Did the activities allow the children to gain the skills or the knowledge that you intended?', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:61e7bcf5-822f-47ce-9415-e1eca44301cd>']}, {'passage': 'Finding Psychological Help for Your Child\nLocating a Therapist\nThe way you find a therapist, psychologist or other mental health professional can be crucial to your child’s success, said Dale Masi, a professor at the University of Maryland graduate school for social work. In her recent book “Shrink to Fit” (Health Communications, $10.95), she suggests seeking referrals from mental health workers you know, your primary physician and people in support groups dealing with the same issues. “You know, most people find a therapist in the telephone book,” she said. “I would not necessarily recommend that.”\nGarnette strongly suggests that parents check with their insurance company or HMO for guidelines about what is covered and for how long. When in doubt about a practitioner, she would turn to a trusted friend. “Your best bet is a friend who operates very much like you do,” Garnette said. Once you have a few names, Masi suggests meeting with the doctors without your child. Go armed with a list of questions and get answers about their education, experience, expertise with children, and the specific issues or diagnoses affecting your child. “You should not feel uncomfortable interviewing a therapist,” Masi said. And think about the office atmosphere. Masi would have doubts about a doctor who claimed to specialize in children, but who had no toys or child-sized furniture in the waiting room. “Definitely look for an expertise in treating children,” Garnette said. “Children are not all little adults. A lot of it has to do with how you just click with a person because it’s so personal.”\nGarnette would also seek someone with a few years’ experience because “you do get better with practice.”\nLeman also recommends finding a therapist who wants to help the child, not finish the payments on his yacht. “Find someone who wants to get rid of you,” he said. “If they’re good, they want the child to be well and take off on his own.”\nHe would also check with the local mental health society or board for any misconduct cases against a professional you’re considering. Don’t expect to rely on one psychiatrist, psychologist or therapist alone. Many cases are best helped by a network of parents and professionals working together on different aspects of the child’s therapy. As a result, Masi suggests asking about affiliations when interviewing the initial professional. “If she’s not a psychiatrist, ask what psychiatrist she works with and if that person is a child psychiatrist,” Masi said. For many cases, experts recommend a comprehensive plan, taking in a few professionals. For example, a plan for a child showing severe attention problems in school might include talk therapy with a family therapist, participation in a social-skills group and drug management through a psychiatrist. “Ideally, you want a situation in which all those people talk to each other and that ‘s really difficult,” Garnette said. The situation is made more difficult by current practices in health management organizations and insurers that often have definite guidelines regarding length of treatment and the types of professional care covered. On average, Garnette says, managed-care companies will pay for 10 to 15 sessions, but it’s often fewer. In advocating for her son, she once threatened a vice president of her HMO with a lawsuit before the company agreed to extra care. “They want to cure everyone in four sessions and it’s just not possible,” Garnette said. And ask up front how long the therapist expects his or her work with your child to continue. Even a rough estimate can help you plan for expenses and the effect on the child and the family, Masi says. Traumatic situations don’t always allow for weeks of planning. However, some don’t require a therapist either, Leman says. In the case of a child grieving after a family member’s death, Leman encourages parents to “give themselves more credit.”\n“Why would a kid want to see a stranger if they’re grieving?” he asked. “Share your imperfect self with your child. It’s healthy for them to see you cry, pray, be concerned. That’s OK.”\nGarnette cautions parents to remain involved in the therapy process so they will see if changes are needed. Her son went through five psychiatrists before he found one that seemed a perfect match. “It’s worth it when you get there,” Garnette said. “Your gut feeling is often right.”\nGuinness, M.

                ""text"": ""Every child is unique. They have different personalities, temperaments, and needs, and no one understands a child better than their parent. However, when parents get a divorce, it is customary that the courts end up making most of the decisions about the kids. While judges do their best to take into account the best interests of a child, it\u2019s unrealistic to expect them to understand the needs of your child as deeply and fully as you do. Often, the end result is a parenting plan that doesn\u2019t meet the needs of any member of the family\u2014including the kids. Developing a parenting plan that meets the needs of your kids and your family is not a simple task. Divorce is a complex emotional process that can make it difficult for even well-intentioned parents to work together. For parents that are committed to developing a parenting plan that meets the unique needs of your kids and also understand the challenges of developing that plan, finding a network of professionals to support that process can be invaluable. Outside professionals can be used in all types of divorce. Collaborative divorce and mediated divorce models use a wide range of outside professionals to create an actively managed process that allows parties to maintain control of the divorce and develop a settlement that meets the needs of their family. The Benefits of Working with a Child Specialist to Create a Parenting Plan\nWhen children are involved, the professional team can include a child specialist. A child specialist is a mental health professional with extensive experience working with kids and families going through the divorce process. A child specialist can support families undergoing divorce either as a member of a collaborative divorce team or as a consultant for a traditional divorce and provides the following services:\n- Brings your child\u2019s voice and perspective into the process while helping to keep your child out of the middle of your divorce\n- Provides expertise in child development to understand the specific developmental needs of your child based on their age and the most current literature and research\n- Recommends strategies to effectively communicate your divorce to your children\n- Assists you in developing a co-parenting plan that meets the needs of your family\n- Helps parents understand the damaging consequences of conflict and helps develop co-parenting skills that minimize conflict\nThe role of a child specialist is to work with the parents to develop a parenting plan that evaluates a child\u2019s age, developmental level and personality characteristics against key family dynamics\u2014such as the parents\u2019 work hours, flexibility and travel\u2014to craft a parenting plan to meet the needs of the family. While less prevalent, couples engaged in a traditional litigated divorce can also utilize mental health professionals such as a child specialist to assist in developing a parenting plan. In these divorces, the professionals work in a consultant role to provide the parties with the expertise needed to make good decisions. The Cost-Benefit Analysis of Working with Outside Professionals\nThe financial cost of a divorce can be overwhelming, making parents hesitant to bring in additional professionals. However, working with a professional such as a child specialist can not only lead to a better outcome but also lower the cost of a divorce. Working with a child specialist to develop a parenting plan can reduce the time spent with lawyers. In the absence of a child specialist, couples will often have to work with lawyers to develop a parenting plan. Having a child specialist reduces this time and also allows parents to pay each profession only for their specific expertise: pay the lawyer for their legal advice and pay the mental health professional for child development and parenting input. Employing a child specialist (or other professionals such as a divorce coach) can also reduce the emotional toll associated with a divorce. A trained mental health professional can help manage the strong emotions and assist with communication. They can also help divorcing parents develop strategies to co-parent effectively. Recognizing a child\u2019s strengths and struggles allows parents to develop a parenting plan that meets the child\u2019s needs during and after a divorce. Taking charge of this process and figuring out what your unique kid needs\u2014and putting that into action\u2014may require some help, but will pay strong dividends for both parents and the child in the future."",

                ""text"": ""For that reason, they often make an oppositional youngster uncomfortable. The structure and level of aggrevation the child slips into this part of the assessment can be quite revealing and helpful in planning intervention. Two common examples of projectives are sentence completion tasks and standardized ink blot instruments. Diagnostic interview: A comprehensive interview with the child provides a wealth of strategic information. I happen to use a 155 question interview that I developed for this purpose (although it\u2019s not always necessary to ask them all). The interview captures the youngster\u2019s take on peer relationships, school functioning, factors of home and community and, of course, self. It samples their concerns in their terms, providing insight to areas where they would be most receptive to intervention. All this information is then complied into a comprehensive report that outlines the findings, provides a diagnosis (if there is one), and offers recommendations for intervention. The cost of an assessment like this ranges from a few hundred dollars to well over $1,000. Health insurance generally covers some, if not all, of the expense. Who can do these evaluations? Psychologists can, as well as anyone else trained and licensed or certified to do all components of the assessment. If your child\u2019s oppositional and defiant behavior is causing them to have serious trouble progressing through school, you might ask the school to do an assessment. They have folks on staff who do this sort of thing all the time. They usually have at least one doctorate level psychologist on staff or as a consultant to help with the tougher challenges. Large counties often have a county psychological board (check the phone book) that can refer specialists who work with children. Also, a department of psychology or counseling of a nearby university (universities offer graduate training) might provide assistance or direction. In some cases, they may provide actual counseling or therapy services through their lab programs. Although the services are being provided by students, they are supervised, and they are usually motivated to do a good job. You don\u2019t have much to lose, and the cost is minmal (like free, if they need kids). Keep in mind also that school counselors are required to maintain a resource list as part of their Crisis Response Plan. Ask them; they can probably help directly, or initiate a referral. Then, of course, there\u2019s always the phone book. I believe it is best to find someone who specializes in children and adolescents. Who should do the counseling or therapy? For obvious reasons, it helps a lot if it is the same person who did the assessment. Rapport is already established, and there is no confusion regarding the interpretation of assessment results. Sometimes, however, this is not possible. I get a lot of calls and email asking about how to locate specialists in ODD in different states. Sorry, I\u2019m not aware of any registry like this, although county psychological boards might list specialties. That would be a good place to start."",

The child specialist is a licensed professional who has expertise in working with children, adolescents, adults, family systems and divorce. S/he is knowledgeable about the emotional and cognitive development of children and can provide answers to your questions and guidance, as needed. Child specialists are experienced in gathering information and sharing recommendations with parents that are specific to each child\u2019s personality and needs. Having been trained in mediation and collaborative divorce, in addition to fulfilling the requisites of their clinical professional licenses, they are well qualified to help you create a Parenting Plan, which covers all aspects of your children\u2019s needs following the dissolution of a break-up or divorce. The child specialist is a member of the collaborative divorce team who first meets with both parents to gather background information on the children\u2019s personalities, predilections and possible problems. He/she will want to know what the children already know about the divorce and how the parents have dealt with, or plan to deal with, the situation. S/he can advise you on how to tell the children about the change in your family and how to prepare them to meet with the child specialist. Parents often seek guidance on the best way to inform their children, about separation, and/or divorce. The child specialist\u2019s role is to understand what is especially important and meaningful to each child and share that information with parents. S/he educates parents about the impact of divorce and family transition on their particular children, given their ages, personalities and established relationships with each parent. Working with both parents, the child specialist tailors the Parenting Plan to each family\u2019s specific needs. Cooperative co-parenting, at all times, is basic to insuring continuity, consistency and emotional security. The children\u2019s contact with the child specialist is often brief and focused. They are seen individually and/or together, as appropriate, in a gentle and friendly manner. They are helped to understand that they are their parents\u2019 priority and their input is important to their parents although it is their parents\u2019 responsibility to make decisions. The child specialist can also be available, if child related issues arise, following divorce. After working with parents and children during the collaborative divorce process, I have been so happy to hear more different comments from children:\n\u201cI got punished a lot so thought it was my fault that mommy and daddy were getting divorce. Now I know it wasn\u2019t my fault, just something between them.

                ""text"": ""Treatment Help, Part 3\nSomeone who has just spent some time with your child should be able to give you a few reactions or observations. It is completely reasonable to let evaluators know that you\u2019d like a few minutes at the end of the session to get a sense of what they think. Always take notes. You may be more tense than you realize, and it may be hard to remember exactly what you did or didn\u2019t hear. Ask to have unfamiliar terms spelled out and explained and request sources of information you can consult. If you\u2019ve had a full multi-specialty evaluation done, consider making an appointment to come back in, sit down, and discuss the results. Keep a notebook. As time goes by, you will think of questions you want to ask, observations about your child that seem significant, ideas for further assessment or therapy. Write them all down in a notebook. There you can also make note of the specialists you see, the tests they do, the information they give. Jot down phone numbers of programs or specialists you learn about from other parents, as well as contact data for someone who isn\u2019t that helpful now but may be in a few years. A notebook will help you track your child and your own understanding. It will also help you use your time with the specialists to ask the questions you\u2019ve been wanting to bring up. Trust your instincts. Go into this process with an open mind but also with a healthy degree of skepticism. If someone tells you something that absolutely does not fit with your sense of your child, consider it objectively. If it\u2019s nonsense, forget it. Don\u2019t let someone who can\u2019t answer questions to your satisfaction pursue a long-term therapeutic relationship with your child, no matter how grand or glorious his degrees or reception room. Don\u2019t expect a \u201ceureka\u201d moment. We\u2019ll say it again because it\u2019s so important: By and large, quirky kids don\u2019t fit neatly into diagnostic categories. The ongoing process of having your child assessed and considering different diagnoses can be valuable if it points the way to helping your child. Still, it\u2019s probably not going to yield a single, illuminating conclusion when you find out what\u2019s \u201creally\u201d going on. Some specialists or clinics will give almost anyone a diagnosis. If you look hard and long enough, you will come across someone who will pin a label on your child\u2014perhaps because it\u2019s the same label everybody gets at that particular clinic. Be especially wary of labels that carry immediate recommendations for expensive therapists. Don\u2019t let anyone prey on your desire to help your child. It\u2019s worth getting a second opinion or discussing the recommendation with your own pediatrician. Most of the professionals you will encounter as you look into assessment and diagnosis will be honorable. It must be said, however, that there is something of an industry out there in providing diagnoses and therapies to kids with developmental variations. This brings us, once again, to our preference for the academic medical center. Finally, don\u2019t forget that the point of all this\u2014the workup, the testing, the consideration of your child by multiple experts\u2014is not to come up with the right label, the right name, the right answer on some cosmic medical-student exam. It\u2019s to help your child\u2014and to help you help your child. Adapted from Quirky Kids (Ballantine), by Perri Klass, M.D., and Eileen Costello, M.D. Reprinted with permission from Random House.

                ""text"": ""Treatment For Mental Health Disorders In Children\n- Advice on managing distressing feelings and unwanted behaviour\n- Family appointments to think about ways to resolve problems together\n- Individual therapy for your child to help them understand their feelings and learn new ways of coping\n- Medication prescribed by a child and adolescent psychiatrist\n- Support to other professionals about how best they can help you and your child\nCognitive Behavioural Therapy\nA model that focuses on the relationship between thoughts, feelings and behaviours and explores practical and meaningful ways of working through current difficulties. The young person is understood as part of an organic and evolving system, for example the family. Change in one part of the system affects the system as a whole. Parent Training (Behavioural Therapy)\nThe therapist coaches parents in applying such strategies as rewarding positive behaviour, and responding to negative behaviour with clear consequences and time out . There is increasing evidence that medication can be a helpful addition to other treatments in some conditions e.g. severe depression, OCD, ADHD\nLiaison with Other Agencies\nIt is often important to share information about the child with professionals e.g. teachers, Paediatricians or school nurses, so that everyone is working together. When A Child Is Referred To Us\n- All referrals are discussed by the team before a first appointment is offered. An initial appointment may be with any of the team, depending on the problem being referred. - We would usually see the parents and child together as well as separately, as appropriate. - After this, further sessions with the same clinician may be offered if appropriate, or a more detailed assessment organised with other members of the team. - At the end of an assessment or piece of treatment, we would usually produce a report for the family, which can be shared with others e.g. GPs, with the family\u2019s consent\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat mental health problems can children experience? Whilst serious mental illnesses are rare in children, emotional and behavioural problems are common, for example:\n- Low mood\n- Poor performance at school\nThese may be a response to stresses in a child\u2019s environment, such as bereavement, illness in a family member, or divorce. The child may be suffering trauma, such as bullying. Or they may have a developmental disability such as a learning difficulty, autism or Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). Who are the different people that make up the CAMHS multidisciplinary team? - Child and adolescent psychiatrists \u2013 these are medical doctors who specialise in young people\u2019s mental health, including the use of psychological and pharmacological therapy. They have specialist knowledge of child development, the links between physical and mental health, and how biological, psychological and social issues may combine to produce mental health problems. - Clinical psychologists \u2013 these have a comprehensive doctoral training in mental health and emotional wellbeing. They have detailed knowledge of patterns of thinking, feeling, relating and behaviour. They can complete assessments that can indicate issues that may affect learning (e.g. memory, attention). Clinical psychologists may specialise in particular therapies e.g. family therapy or Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). - Child and adolescent mental health nurses \u2013 these are qualified mental health nurses who specialise in working with young people with mental health problems and their families. They often have additional training in specific therapies e.g. family therapy, CBT, parent training, or psychodynamic approaches to treatment. They usually work in multidisciplinary teams, liaising closely with GPs, schools, and social workers, etc. Does my child need a child psychiatrist? It may not be necessary for your child to see a psychiatrist. All members of our team are highly qualified and experienced, and our nurse and psychologist are able to offer initial assessments. They are also experts in psychological treatments e.g. parenting support, family work, individual therapy. A psychiatrist may need to be involved if:\n- There are concerns about serious mental illness, physical ill-health, or a complex developmental disorder. - Psychological approaches haven\u2019t been sufficient and another treatment, such as medication, needs to be considered. Why does CAMHS share information with other professionals? We have a legal and professional duty to do what is in a child\u2019s best interests, which includes sharing information when necessary. Children will often be experiencing difficulties in multiple settings e.g. school, home, social situations. Treatment may therefore combine clinic-based therapy, parents carrying out behaviour management strategies at home, and support from school. All the adults working together (e.g."",

all division champions (excluding Division 1) will be promoted in the team
rankings and all the teams placed bottom of divisions (excluding the lowest
division) will be relegated in the team rankings. 3.2.2 At the end of the season, all 2nd place teams in
each division (excluding Division 1) will compete in play-off matches against
the team 2nd from bottom in the division above. If the team in the lower

team from the higher division. In the team in the higher division wins then
there is no change to the team rankings. D1 result : A1 (1st), A2(2nd), A3(2nd from bottom), A4(bottom)

The English Leagues Cup Competitions Finals saw a fitting tribute to 80 years of the Wilmott Cup with some superb play, close matches and lots of passion and pleasure over the two days. To celebrate the 80 years commemorative mugs and souvenir programmes were provided to all competitors at the finals weekend on June 13 & 14, 2015, and were very well received. Details of the programme which gives information on the history of both the Wilmott Cup and JM Rose Bowl, as well as what was happening in the ETTA in 1935 and other historical information can be found by clicking here. Wilmott Cup (Men)
The day started with the No 1 seeds Leamington Spa up against Central London C. After the fourth game it was 2-2 but Leamington took the last game for the win. The second match in that group saw a similar 3-2 scoreline, with Reading beating Leeds. In Round 2, both scores were again 3-2, this time Reading and Leeds were the victors over Central London C and Leamington Spa respectively. Round 3 also saw the same scorelines, all matches being won 3-2, with Reading taking their third win to top the group and Central London C gaining their first victory. So, a three-way countback to decide the final group positions which went down to the number of games won. The final group placings were Reading 1st, Leamington Spa 2nd, Central London C 3rd and Leeds 4th. Meanwhile, on the adjacent tables many similarly close games were taking place. Sheffield, the No 2 seeds, struggled against the Bristol team in their first match and lost by a surprising 4-1. In the other match in this group Guildford defeated Central London B 3-2. Round 2 saw Central London C gain a 3-2 victory over Bristol and Sheffield crept past Guildford for the win in the fifth game. In the final round in the group, Sheffield hit another gear to overcome Central London B 5-0 with Guildford having their second 3-2, win this time against Bristol. Final group placings: Sheffield 1st, Guildford 2nd, London Central B 3rd and Bristol 4th. The two top teams, Sheffield and Reading, faced each other for the title and the trophy. Sheffield went 2-0 up thanks to Warren Li Kam Wa and Michael Fraser, winning their two singles. The doubles went to Reading and then Michael Fraser played a captain’s part to take the fourth and the championship. Guildford had a straight 3-0 win over Leamington Spa to take the bronze medal. London pride was at stake in the derby between the two Central London teams. The final honours went to the B team but only after a titanic struggle which resulted in four games going to four and one to five. Meanwhile, Leeds were defeating Bristol by 3-1 for seventh position. So many games were so close and but for a few points in many matches the play-off matches could have been in a totally different order. All teams won matches and all teams lost matches with Sheffield, the eventual winners, losing to the team who finished eighth, such was the margin between all the teams. Sheffield: Mike Fraser, David Thompson, Warren Li Kam Wa
Reading: Hari Gehlot, Daniel Moses
Guildford: Chris Bush, Adam Laws
Leamington Spa: Matthew Outhwaite, Ryan Stockham, James Ward
Central London B: Kevin Kan, Andreas Pusch, Hoang Vu

To celebrate the 80 years commemorative mugs and souvenir programmes were provided to all competitors at the finals weekend on June 13 & 14, 2015, and were very well received. Details of the programme which gives information on the history of both the Wilmott Cup and JM Rose Bowl, as well as what was happening in the ETTA in 1935 and other historical information can be found by clicking here. Wilmott Cup (Men)\nThe day started with the No 1 seeds Leamington Spa up against Central London C. After the fourth game it was 2-2 but Leamington took the last game for the win. The second match in that group saw a similar 3-2 scoreline, with Reading beating Leeds. In Round 2, both scores were again 3-2, this time Reading and Leeds were the victors over Central London C and Leamington Spa respectively. Round 3 also saw the same scorelines, all matches being won 3-2, with Reading taking their third win to top the group and Central London C gaining their first victory. So, a three-way countback to decide the final group positions which went down to the number of games won. The final group placings were Reading 1st, Leamington Spa 2nd, Central London C 3rd and Leeds 4th. Meanwhile, on the adjacent tables many similarly close games were taking place. Sheffield, the No 2 seeds, struggled against the Bristol team in their first match and lost by a surprising 4-1. In the other match in this group Guildford defeated Central London B 3-2. Round 2 saw Central London C gain a 3-2 victory over Bristol and Sheffield crept past Guildford for the win in the fifth game. In the final round in the group, Sheffield hit another gear to overcome Central London B 5-0 with Guildford having their second 3-2, win this time against Bristol. Final group placings: Sheffield 1st, Guildford 2nd, London Central B 3rd and Bristol 4th. The two top teams, Sheffield and Reading, faced each other for the title and the trophy. Sheffield went 2-0 up thanks to Warren Li Kam Wa and Michael Fraser, winning their two singles. The doubles went to Reading and then Michael Fraser played a captain’s part to take the fourth and the championship. Guildford had a straight 3-0 win over Leamington Spa to take the bronze medal. London pride was at stake in the derby between the two Central London teams. The final honours went to the B team but only after a titanic struggle which resulted in four games going to four and one to five. Meanwhile, Leeds were defeating Bristol by 3-1 for seventh position. So many games were so close and but for a few points in many matches the play-off matches could have been in a totally different order. All teams won matches and all teams lost matches with Sheffield, the eventual winners, losing to the team who finished eighth, such was the margin between all the teams. Sheffield: Mike Fraser, David Thompson, Warren Li Kam Wa\nReading: Hari Gehlot, Daniel Moses\nGuildford: Chris Bush, Adam Laws\nLeamington Spa: Matthew Outhwaite, Ryan Stockham, James Ward\nCentral London B: Kevin Kan, Andreas Pusch, Hoang Vu\nCentral London C: Fabien Mauroy, Javier Sanchez\nLeeds: Simon Pugh, Richard Smith\nBristol: Martin Gunn, Dave Reeves\nJM Rose Bowl (Ladies)\nLeeds ladies, the No 1 seeds and winner of the trophy in 2013, started their campaign to regain the trophy with a 5-0 victory over Tamworth whilst Leicester, by a narrow margin, defeated Guildford 3-2. Round 2, and Leeds continued their winning ways by defeating Guildford 4-1 and Tamworth had a good 4-1 win over Leicester in the longest match of the day. In the third round, Leeds made it a hat-trick of wins, defeating Leicester 4-1, whilst Tamworth gained their second win, just edging Guildford 3-2.

                ""text"": ""Full-time from Gresty Road\nO'Brien, making his first League One start of the season, opened The Lions' account on 21 minutes with a poacher's goal and although Crewe levelled with a fortuitous header from Lauri Dalla Valle (36mins), O'Brien added two crackers on 64 and then 74 minutes to complete his treble. It was a thoroughly deserved victory for Neil Harris' charges, who played with energy, skill and increasing confidence as the game wore on. Millwall showed two changes from the side that beat Peterborough United last time out with Jimmy Abdou and Steve Morison returning to the starting XI at the expense of Ben Thompson and John Marquis, both of whom dropped to the bench. Nelson was involved at the other end three minutes later with a superbly timed interception to clear the danger as Bradden Inman broke through into the penalty area. Back came The Lions though, and Steve Morison bamboozled the Crewe rearguard with some neat footwork on 12 minutes before forcing keeper Ben Garratt into a smart save to keep out his snap-shot. However there was little Garratt could do to prevent The Lions from breaking the deadlock after 21 minutes. Right-back Carlos Edwards was involved again with a fine run on the overlap, delivering an inviting cross that Morison met with a stinging drive which was blocked by the keeper. The ball fell to O'Brien, who turned on a sixpence with his back to goal and arrowed a drive that flew into the back of the net. Millwall really had the bit between their teeth now and pushed forward in search of a second goal. The pace of Fred Onyedinma and O'Brien seemed to frighten the life out of the Crewe defence as the young Lions teased and tormented a hesitant looking rearguard. After another neat move, O\u2019Brien couldn\u2019t quite on the end of Onyedinma's cut back but after the ball was cleared, Ed Upson's volley landed on the top of the net. Morison was a whisker away from connecting with the influential Williams' diagonal ball as The Lions kept their foot on the gas, but it was Crewe who stunned their opponents scoring an equaliser against the run of play nine minutes before the interval. The ball ricocheted in the penalty area following Inman's shot and Dalla Valle got the final touch past the wrong-footed Jordan Archer, although the Crewe man seemed to know little about it as the ball slammed off his head. Millwall weren't put off by the misfortune however, and the tireless Morison's sublime skill almost restored their lead, controlling a high ball expertly, giving Harry Davis the slip, only to send his effort from the edge of the box straight into Garratt's hands. Webster nearly scored within 60 seconds of arriving on the field, but just couldn't direct his header from a Williams' corner towards goal, and the ball flew over the bar. However, The Lions were indebted to keeper Archer soon after when Crewe's Davis found himself clear after a front post corner was missed, Archer saved his shot and then brilliantly turned Dalla Valle's follow-up round the post. The volume was cranked up a further notch when O'Brien completed his hat-trick with another sublime goal. Picking up the ball 20 yards out, he ghosted his way past four defenders with some superb close control and cracked home a powerful effort past the outstretched hand of Garratt. Cue a mass celebration as the young striker disappeared under a mass of his jubilant team-mates!

""The Wife of Bath"", from Chaucer, and two translations from the ""Odyssey""—the ""Arrival of Ulysses at Ithaca"" and the ""Garden of Alcinous""—came out in 1714 in a volume of miscellanies edited by Steele for Tonson, the publisher. ""The Temple of Fame"", in which Steele said there were a thousand beauties, was separately published in the following year, 1715. In November of 1713 a turning point was reached in Pope's fortunes. He issued proposals for the publication, by subscription, of a translation of Homer's ""Iliad"" into English verse, with notes. The matter was warmly taken up, and subscriptions poured in apace. His friends stood by him, Swift in particular obtaining a long list of influential patrons. Work was at once begun on the undertaking, and the first four books appeared in 1715, the remaining volumes coming out at intervals in 1716, 1717, 1718, and 1720, when the task was completed. Three years later he undertook the translation of the ""Odyssey"", which, with the aid of Broome and Fenton as collaborators, he completed by 1726. Pope's exact share was twelve books; the rest were by his assistants. By Homer Pope made close on £2000, which, added to what his father had left him, placed him in a position of independence for the remainder of his life. While engaged on his great translation Pope found time for other forms of literary work, and in 1717 he published two of the very best of his lyrics, namely, the ""Elegy to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady"" and the ""Epistle of Eloïsa to Abelard"", and he joined with Gay and Arbuthnot in writing and producing the unsuccessful farce ""Three Hours after Marriage"". He also undertook for Tonson, the publisher, an annotated edition of Shakespeare, which appeared in 1725, a task for which Pope's powers were unequal, for he was not sufficiently versed in the literature of the Elizabethan and Jacobean period, and although the preface is very fine and many shrewd emendations were made in the text, Pope's Shakespeare was on the whole far from being a success. It was at once attacked by Theobald, who thus exposed himself to the characteristic vengeance which Pope was shortly to take by making him the first hero of the ""Dunciad"". In 1713-14 Pope, with Swift, Arbuthnot, and other leaders of the Tory Party, had formed a sort of literary society called the Scriblerus Club, and had amused themselves by burlesquing the vagaries of literature in the ""Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus"", which, although included in the edition of Pope's prose works in 1741, was mainly the composition of Arbuthnot. Arising partly out of the performance of ""Scriblerus"", Pope and Swift published in 1727-28 three volumes of their ""Miscellanies"", which contained among other things Pope's ""Treatise on the Bathos, or the Art of Sinking in Poetry"", illustrated by examples from the inferior poets of the day. These ""Miscellanies"", and particularly the ""Bathos"", drew down upon the authors a torrent of abuse from every quill-driver and poetaster who had been in reality attacked or fancied himself ridiculed. The ""Dunciad"" was in turn the outcome of these invectives. This celebrated satire first appeared, in three books, in May, 1728, and an enlarged edition followed in 1729. In 1742 a further issue appeared with the addition of a fourth book, and in 1743 the poem came out in its final form with Theobald dethroned and Colley Cibber installed in his room as King of the Dunces. The publication of this swinging satire naturally increased the fury against Pope, who was roundly abused in all the moods and tenses. Nor did he shrink from the fray. He gave back blow for blow for eight years, 1730-37, in a weekly sheet, the ""Grub Street Journal"", as well as paying off old scores when opportunity offered in his avowed and more ambitious publications.

From 1598 he published his translation of the Iliad in installments. In 1616 the complete Iliad and Odyssey appeared in The Whole Works of Homer, the first complete English translation, which until Pope's was the most popular in the English language and was the way most English speakers encountered these poems. The endeavour was to have been profitable: his patron, Prince Henry, had promised him £300 on its completion plus a pension. However, Henry died in 1612 and his household neglected the commitment, leaving Chapman without either a patron or an income. In an extant letter, Chapman petitions for the money owed him; his petition was ineffective. Chapman's translation of the Odyssey is written in iambic pentameter, whereas his Iliad is written in iambic heptameter. (The Greek original is in dactylic hexameter.) Chapman often extends and elaborates on Homer's original contents to add descriptive detail or moral and philosophical interpretation and emphasis. Chapman's translation of Homer was much admired by John Keats, notably in his famous poem On First Looking into Chapman's Homer, and also drew attention from Samuel Taylor Coleridge and T. S. Eliot. Chapman also translated the Homeric Hymns, the Georgics of Virgil, The Works of Hesiod (1618, dedicated to Francis Bacon), the Hero and Leander of Musaeus (1618), and the Fifth Satire of Juvenal (1624). There is no danger to a man, that knows
What life and death is: there's not any law
Exceeds his knowledge; neither is it lawful
That he should stoop to any other law. The English poet John Keats wrote ""On First Looking into Chapman's Homer"" for his friend Charles Cowden Clarke in October 1816. The poem begins ""Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold"" and is much quoted. For example, P. G. Wodehouse in his review of the first Flashman novel that came to his attention: ""Now I understand what that 'when a new planet swims into his ken' excitement is all about."" Arthur Ransome uses two references from it in his children's books, the Swallows and Amazons series. From All Fooles, II.1.170-178, by George Chapman:

Eventually THE ILIAD reaches a length of 24 nights, or 24 “books” each taking about an hour to recite, that being an agreeable length of time for an after dinner entertainment. At the same time, one can imagine if the host was stingy, the bed hard, the company frigid... six nights would probably have covered it. Today, a standup comic keeps his material flexible so it may be cut, or streached to suit the audience reaction as he, or she performs it. Homer must have done the same thing, streatching, cutting, rephrasing as he went along to suit the audience of the moment. The point is, that THE ILIAD was elastic, and evolving during Homer’s life time. He did not, at some point, sit down and compose the entire Iliad in one great creative burst of imagination. THE ILIAD grew, and evolved, and changed with Homer’s telling, and re-telling of it. Just as the airplane has evolved from the Wright Brothers “Flyer” to the Boeing 747, something the Wright Brothers could never have conceived of, a literary work could in those days, evolve during a single story tellers life time to something quite beyond his comprehension when he began. After Homer’s lifetime “The Sons of Homer” continued performing Homer’s great works for some 200 years, passing the performance from generation to generation in the oral tradition (that is learning it by listening to some one perform it.) and, no doubt, in each generation it was improved to make it more suitable to the individual performers abilities, and audience. This continued until the sixth century BC, the time of the Tyrant Peisistratus. By this time it is said every village has its own performer of THE ILIAD, and each one of them has a slightly different version to tell. This offended Peisistratus who felt there should be only one version of THE ILIAD, the official, authenticated, version. This he set out to create, or have created. He appointed a commission, or its equivalent for those days and assigned them the task of writing it down so no more changes could be made, and while they’re at it, eliminate, cut out, all those improvements made by inferior poets. This was done, and this is the version we have today. One might well ask, if THE ILIAD is based on previous material, and if it evolved before, during, and after Homer’s lifetime, why do we give Homer sole credit for authorship? This is a good question. One scholars have been dealing with for over 2000 years. Here is my opinion: Homer’s greatness lies not so much in his poetry, or in his selection of every word of THE ILIAD, and THE ODYSSEY. Though the selection of those words and the order in which he selected them make THE ILIAD one of the greatest works of art by man. His greatness lies in what he did to the art and craft of story telling. He made two improvements which changed forever the course of Western literature, and in some ways changed the way Man perceives himself. Since before the time of Homer and through to today, the art and craft of story telling is basically narrative. That is the story teller tells who, what, when, where, why, and how. He uses lots of colorful adjectives, and adverbs, throws in some sound bites and he has his story. The “news writer” of today working in television, or newspaper, uses the same art and craft. If he is a story teller of the Bronze age, he composes it in a poetic meter so that it may be more easily memorized and passed on. This “narrative” form has served well for thousands of years. Homer’s first improvement was to change the narrative form into what scholars today call the dramatic. That is he expands, and extends the “sound bite” from a quote describing what the person said into a prolonged speech which is spoken in the first person, present tense. These speeches allow the narrator to not just report what was said, but to become the person saying it. And, as he assumes the character, and expresses the passion of the speaker, the audience can see deep into the heart and soul of the character. They can see his hidden agendas, the honesty of his emotion, the truth of his motives, the value of his character. Homer’s second improvement was one which allowed the first one to work.

'The Iliad WASN'T written by a man named Homer': Historian claims the name referred to a group of storytellers - and that they lived 1,000 years earlier than thought
- Adam Nicolson says Homer was a tradition of storytelling not a single man
- He believes The Iliad is 1,000 years older than dates for when Homer lived
- He says the poems began as stories that were shared and refined orally
- He began studying Homer ten years ago after being caught in a storm
- Mr Nicolson has written a book on how Homer should be interpreted today
The ancient Greek poet Homer was not a single person but actually an entire culture of storytelling, a historian has claimed. Adam Nicolson, an author and historian who has studied Homer, believes the epic poems of The Iliad and The Odyssey have their origins around 2,000 BC - 1,000 years earlier than the man who wrote them is said to have lived. Instead, he claims the stories evolved as a tradition that were shared and refined as spoken poems for hundreds of years. Little is known about who Homer, seen here in an idealised marble bust from the Roman period, really was
Speaking in an interview with National Geographic, Mr Nicolson, who is the Fifth Baron Carnock, said that the idea of Homer as a single author has emerged due to an 'author obsession'. He said: 'I think it's a mistake to think of Homer as a person. Homer is an ""it"" - a tradition. Adam Nicolson has written a book about what Homer can tell us about life in the modern world
'An entire culture coming up with ever more refined and ever more understanding ways of telling stories that are important to it.' There is very little known about exactly who or what Homer was, but is believed by the ancient Greeks to have been the first great epic poet. Some accounts claim he was a blind poet who lived between 1,102BC to 850BC. A guild of singing story tellers, or rhapsodes, later emerged known as the Homeridae and has led some to argue that Homer was actually a mythical figure whose name was derived from the guild. Some of the earliest written works attributed to Homer were found with the mummified remains of Green Egyptians from around 150-200 BC. The oldest complete Iliad manuscript is found in the doge's library in Venice and is thought to date from 900AD. Mr Nicolson, who lives in Kent, said that notes in the margins of this manuscript, which was created in the Constantinople-Byzantium, provide some clues to what the origin of the Iliad may have been. He said: 'One of the exciting things that emerge from that is that in the early days it seems there was no such thing as a single Iliad, no one fixed text, but this wild and variable tradition of the stories, with many different versions in different parts of the Mediterranean, endlessly interacting with itself, like a braided stream in the mountains.' Mr Nicolson said he first became interested in Homer around ten years ago when he began reading The Odyssey while waiting for his yacht to be repaired after it was damaged in a storm while sailing up the west coast of Britain. He describes reading The Odyssey as being like somebody 'telling me what it was like to be alive on Earth'. Homer is depicted as a blind bard in this painting by Jean-Baptiste August Leloir, held at the Louvre in Paris
Early written accounts of The Iliad, like this 5th or 6th Century codex in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, are very rare and the stories are thought to have been passed down by oral storytelling for hundreds of years

LEGEND OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE WAS BASED ON REAL GOLD MINERS
The ancient Greek legend of Jason and his Argonauts' quest for the Golden Fleece may have been based on a real expedition to an ancient kingdom on the Black Sea. The story is thought to have been in circulation even at the time of Homer and was thought to have been a myth.

When did Homer write the Iliad? Usually considered to have been written down circa the 8th century BC, the Iliad is among the oldest extant works of Western literature, along with the Odyssey, another epic poem attributed to Homer which tells of Odysseus’s experiences after the events of the Iliad. Is the Iliad older than the Bible? No. The Iliad and Odyssey predate the Bible by several hundred years. Was the Iliad written before the Odyssey? The Iliad is the earlier work (it was written first) . Also the events in the Odyssey are a direct consequence of what happens in the Iliad and the reader of the Odyssey is assumed to know the summary of the plot in the Iliad and who the main characters are. Why did Homer write Iliad? Homer probably wished he could have witnessed the events of the Trojan War, but the actual battle dates more than 400 years before there was ever any mention of the poet Homer. Who Killed Achilles? The story of Achilles is one of the most important legends in Greek mythology. Achilles was said to have died from a heel wound as the result of a poisoned arrow shot by Paris, Hector’s brother (see Figure 2). Is the Iliad true? As the historical sources – Herodotus and Eratosthenes – show, it was generally assumed to have been a real event. According to Homer’s Iliad, the conflict between the Greeks – led by Agamemnon, King of Mycenae – and the Trojans – whose king was Priam – took place in the Late Bronze Age, and lasted 10 years. How old is the Iliad now? The text is Homer’s “Iliad,” and Homer — if there was such a person — probably wrote it in 762 B.C., give or take 50 years, the researchers found. The “Iliad” tells the story of the Trojan War — if there was such a war — with Greeks battling Trojans. Is the Iliad The oldest book? The Epic of Gilgamesh is the oldest known piece of literature in the world. Written in 2100 BCE it predates Homer’s Iliad by 1500 years. What does the word Iliad mean? 1a: a series of miseries or disastrous events. b: a series of exploits regarded as suitable for an epic. 2: a long narrative especially: an epic in the Homeric tradition. Is the Iliad hard to read? For the first-time reader, probably the hardest thing about Homer’s Iliad is its language. And once you get past the weird cultural details (reading the introduction to your edition will help), the poem is extremely accessible. The characters are vivid, and every reader will find someone to identify with. Is the Iliad a good read? It’s battle scenes are majestic, yet heartbreaking in it’s understanding of human tragedy, life and fate. It’s a beautifully deep work, it’s timeless and there is so much that can be learnt from it. Originally Answered: Is The Iliad worth reading? Yes, definitely. Is Troy based on a true story? No, ‘Troy‘ is not based on a true story. However, the film is based on the epic poem ‘The Iliad. What is the moral lesson of the Iliad? The Iliad, the story of the Trojan War, offers several moral lessons to its readers, including the importance of leaders treating their soldiers with respect, the importance of accepting apologies, and the need for respecting family bonds.

What is Homer’s full name? Homer (/ˈhoʊmər/; Ancient Greek: Ὅμηρος Greek pronunciation: [hómɛːros], Hómēros; c. 800– c. 701 BC) was the presumed author of the Iliad and the Odyssey, two epic poems that are the foundational works of ancient Greek literature.

George Chapman. Frontispiece engraving for The Whole Works of Homer (1616) attributed to William Hole
Hitchin, Hertfordshire, England
|Died||12 May 1634
|Notable works||Bussy D'Ambois, Translations of Homer|
George Chapman (c. 1559 – 12 May 1634) was an English dramatist, translator, and poet. He was a classical scholar whose work shows the influence of Stoicism. Chapman has been identified as the Rival Poet of Shakespeare's sonnets by William Minto, and as an anticipator of the Metaphysical Poets of the 17th century. Chapman is best remembered for his translations of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, and the Homeric Batrachomyomachia. Life and work
Chapman was born at Hitchin in Hertfordshire. There is conjecture that he studied at Oxford but did not take a degree, though no reliable evidence affirms this. We know very little about Chapman's early life, but Mark Eccles uncovered records that reveal much about Chapman's difficulties and expectations. In 1585 Chapman was approached in a friendly fashion by John Wolfall, Sr., who offered to supply a bond of surety for a loan to furnish Chapman money ""for his proper use in Attendance upon the then Right Honorable Sir Rafe Sadler Knight."" Chapman's courtly ambitions led him into a trap. He apparently never received any money, but he would be plagued for many years by the papers he had signed. Wolfall had the poet arrested for debt in 1600, and when in 1608 Wolfall's son, having inherited his father's papers, sued yet again, Chapman's only resort was to petition the Court of Chancery for equity. As Sadler died in 1587 this gives Chapman little time to have trained under him, it seems more likely that he was in Sadler's household from 1577-83 as he dedicates all his Homerical translations to Sadler. He spent the early 1590s abroad, seeing military action in the Low Countries. His earliest published works were the obscure philosophical poems The Shadow of Night (1594) and Ovid's Banquet of Sense (1595). The latter has been taken as a response to the erotic poems of the age such as Philip Sidney's Astrophil and Stella and Shakespeare's Venus and Adonis. Chapman's life was troubled by debt and his inability to find a patron whose fortunes did not decline. Chapman's erstwhile patrons Robert Devereux, Second Earl of Essex and the Prince of Wales, Prince Henry, each met their ends prematurely; the former was executed for treason by Elizabeth I in 1601, and the latter died of typhoid fever at the age of eighteen in 1612. Chapman's resultant poverty did not diminish his ability or his standing among his fellow Elizabethan poets and dramatists. Chapman died in London, having lived his latter years in poverty and debt. He was buried at St Giles in the Fields, a monument to him designed by Inigo Jones marked his tomb, and stands today inside the church. By the end of the 1590s, Chapman had become a successful playwright, working for Philip Henslowe and later for the Children of the Chapel. Among his comedies are The Blind Beggar of Alexandria (1596; printed 1598), An Humorous Day's Mirth (1597; printed 1599), All Fools (printed 1605), Monsieur D'Olive (1605; printed 1606), The Gentleman Usher (printed 1606) May Day (printed 1611), and The Widow's Tears (printed 1612). His plays show a willingness to experiment with dramatic form: An Humorous Day's Mirth was one of the first plays to be written in the style of 'humours comedy' which Ben Jonson later used in Every Man in his Humour and Every Man Out of his Humour. With The Widow's Tears he was also one of the first writers to meld comedy with more serious themes, creating the tragicomedy later made famous by Beaumont and Fletcher. He also wrote one noteworthy play in collaboration. Eastward Ho (1605), written with Jonson and John Marston, contained satirical references to the Scots which landed Chapman and Jonson in jail.

Reviews for Iliad
Library Journal Reviews 1990 August #1
Why another Iliad? Just as Homer's work existed most fully in its performance, so the Homeric texts call periodically for new translations. With this in mind, Fagles offers a new verse rendering of the Iliad. Maneuvering between the literal and the literary, he tries with varying degrees of success to suggest the vigor and manner of the original while producing readable poetry in English. Thus, he avoids the anachronizing of Robert Fitzgerald's translation, while being more literal than Richard Lattimore's. Fagles's efforts are accompanied by a long and penetrating introduction by Bernard Knox, coupled with detailed glossary and textual notes.-- T.L. Cooksey, Armstrong State Coll., Savannah, Ga.

He was hardly an impartial observer of the world he wrote about and often gives personal opinions at length on various people, customs, and events. While his admiration for Homer is always evident, he freely questioned the historical truth of The Iliad, asking why the Achaeans would wage so lengthy and costly a campaign as the Trojan War on behalf of one woman. This is only one of many examples of Herodotus’ personality displaying itself in his work. That he held himself in quite high regard is apparent in the prologue to the Histories which begins, “These are the researches of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, which he publishes, in the hope of thereby preserving from decay the remembrance of what men have done, and of preventing the great and wonderful actions of the Greeks and the Barbarians from losing their due meed of glory; and withal to put on record what were their grounds of feuds” (Histories, I.1). Unlike other ancient writers (such as Homer, earlier, or Virgil, later), Herodotus does not attribute his narrative to divine sources, nor call on such for assistance, but announces clearly that this is his work and no others. His high opinion of himself is also displayed in what is recorded as the first `publication’ of the Histories at the Olympic Games. Works at this time were `published’ by being read aloud and the Greek writer Lucian of Samosata (125-180 CE) claims that Herodotus read the entirety of his work to the audience in one sitting and received great applause. Another version of the publication of the work, however, claims that Herodotus refused to read his book to the crowd until there was ample cloud cover to shade him on the platform. While he waited, the audience left, and this event is what gave rise to the maxim, “Like Herodotus and his shade” (alluding to one who misses an opportunity by waiting for propitious circumstances). Whichever account is true, if either is, they both reflect the esteem Herodotus was known to hold himself in. While little is known of the details of his life, it seems certain that he came from a wealthy, aristocratic family in Asia Minor who could afford to pay for his education. His skill in writing is thought to be evidence of a thorough course in the best schools of his day. He wrote in Ionian Greek and was clearly well read. His ability to travel, seemingly at will, also argues for a man of some means. It is thought he served in the army as a Hoplite in that his descriptions of battle are quite precise and always told from the point of view of a foot soldier. He came to live in the Greek Colony of Thurii, in Italy, where he edited and revised the Histories later in life. He had also lived in Athens and, at some point, it is thought he returned there. Scholars consider it likely that he died in Athens of the plague sometime between 425 and 413 BCE. His fame was so great that many different cities (Athens and Thurii among them) claimed to be the site of his funeral and grave and monuments were erected in his honor. The lasting significance of his work continues to be appreciated by millions of people today and he is considered a primary source for reliable information on the ancient world he observed and wrote about.

The work achieved some popularity, and was reprinted several times, the last in 1797. In 1765 Bridges wrote The Battle of the Genii, a burlesque of John Milton’s Paradise Lost, which was once attributed to Francis Grose.

""The Temple of Fame"", in which Steele said there were a thousand beauties, was separately published in the following year, 1715. In November of 1713 a turning point was reached in Pope\'s fortunes. He issued proposals for the publication, by subscription, of a translation of Homer\'s ""Iliad"" into English verse, with notes. The matter was warmly taken up, and subscriptions poured in apace. His friends stood by him, Swift in particular obtaining a long list of influential patrons. Work was at once begun on the undertaking, and the first four books appeared in 1715, the remaining volumes coming out at intervals in 1716, 1717, 1718, and 1720, when the task was completed. Three years later he undertook the translation of the ""Odyssey"", which, with the aid of Broome and Fenton as collaborators, he completed by 1726. Pope\'s exact share was twelve books; the rest were by his assistants. By Homer Pope made close on £2000, which, added to what his father had left him, placed him in a position of independence for the remainder of his life. While engaged on his great translation Pope found time for other forms of literary work, and in 1717 he published two of the very best of his lyrics, namely, the ""Elegy to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady"" and the ""Epistle of Eloïsa to Abelard"", and he joined with Gay and Arbuthnot in writing and producing the unsuccessful farce ""Three Hours after Marriage"". He also undertook for Tonson, the publisher, an annotated edition of Shakespeare, which appeared in 1725, a task for which Pope\'s powers were unequal, for he was not sufficiently versed in the literature of the Elizabethan and Jacobean period, and although the preface is very fine and many shrewd emendations were made in the text, Pope\'s Shakespeare was on the whole far from being a success. It was at once attacked by Theobald, who thus exposed himself to the characteristic vengeance which Pope was shortly to take by making him the first hero of the ""Dunciad"". In 1713-14 Pope, with Swift, Arbuthnot, and other leaders of the Tory Party, had formed a sort of literary society called the Scriblerus Club, and had amused themselves by burlesquing the vagaries of literature in the ""Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus"", which, although included in the edition of Pope\'s prose works in 1741, was mainly the composition of Arbuthnot. Arising partly out of the performance of ""Scriblerus"", Pope and Swift published in 1727-28 three volumes of their ""Miscellanies"", which contained among other things Pope\'s ""Treatise on the Bathos, or the Art of Sinking in Poetry"", illustrated by examples from the inferior poets of the day. These ""Miscellanies"", and particularly the ""Bathos"", drew down upon the authors a torrent of abuse from every quill-driver and poetaster who had been in reality attacked or fancied himself ridiculed. The ""Dunciad"" was in turn the outcome of these invectives. This celebrated satire first appeared, in three books, in May, 1728, and an enlarged edition followed in 1729. In 1742 a further issue appeared with the addition of a fourth book, and in 1743 the poem came out in its final form with Theobald dethroned and Colley Cibber installed in his room as King of the Dunces. The publication of this swinging satire naturally increased the fury against Pope, who was roundly abused in all the moods and tenses. Nor did he shrink from the fray. He gave back blow for blow for eight years, 1730-37, in a weekly sheet, the ""Grub Street Journal"", as well as paying off old scores when opportunity offered in his avowed and more ambitious publications.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:d6be2450-699b-4573-87d2-9ebc4f0d58c3>']}, {'passage': 'From 1598 he published his translation of the Iliad in installments. In 1616 the complete Iliad and Odyssey appeared in The Whole Works of Homer, the first complete English translation, which until Pope\'s was the most popular in the English language and was the way most English speakers encountered these poems. The endeavour was to have been profitable: his patron, Prince Henry, had promised him £300 on its completion plus a pension. However, Henry died in 1612 and his household neglected the commitment, leaving Chapman without either a patron or an income. In an extant letter, Chapman petitions for the money owed him; his petition was ineffective. Chapman\'s translation of the Odyssey is written in iambic pentameter, whereas his Iliad is written in iambic heptameter. (The Greek original is in dactylic hexameter.) Chapman often extends and elaborates on Homer\'s original contents to add descriptive detail or moral and philosophical interpretation and emphasis. Chapman\'s translation of Homer was much admired by John Keats, notably in his famous poem On First Looking into Chapman\'s Homer, and also drew attention from Samuel Taylor Coleridge and T. S. Eliot. Chapman also translated the Homeric Hymns, the Georgics of Virgil, The Works of Hesiod (1618, dedicated to Francis Bacon), the Hero and Leander of Musaeus (1618), and the Fifth Satire of Juvenal (1624). There is no danger to a man, that knows\nWhat life and death is: there\'s not any law\nExceeds his knowledge; neither is it lawful\nThat he should stoop to any other law. The English poet John Keats wrote ""On First Looking into Chapman\'s Homer"" for his friend Charles Cowden Clarke in October 1816. The poem begins ""Much have I travell\'d in the realms of gold"" and is much quoted. For example, P. G. Wodehouse in his review of the first Flashman novel that came to his attention: ""Now I understand what that \'when a new planet swims into his ken\' excitement is all about.""

At the same time, one can imagine if the host was stingy, the bed hard, the company frigid... six nights would probably have covered it. Today, a standup comic keeps his material flexible so it may be cut, or streached to suit the audience reaction as he, or she performs it. Homer must have done the same thing, streatching, cutting, rephrasing as he went along to suit the audience of the moment. The point is, that THE ILIAD was elastic, and evolving during Homer’s life time. He did not, at some point, sit down and compose the entire Iliad in one great creative burst of imagination. THE ILIAD grew, and evolved, and changed with Homer’s telling, and re-telling of it. Just as the airplane has evolved from the Wright Brothers “Flyer” to the Boeing 747, something the Wright Brothers could never have conceived of, a literary work could in those days, evolve during a single story tellers life time to something quite beyond his comprehension when he began. After Homer’s lifetime “The Sons of Homer” continued performing Homer’s great works for some 200 years, passing the performance from generation to generation in the oral tradition (that is learning it by listening to some one perform it.) and, no doubt, in each generation it was improved to make it more suitable to the individual performers abilities, and audience. This continued until the sixth century BC, the time of the Tyrant Peisistratus. By this time it is said every village has its own performer of THE ILIAD, and each one of them has a slightly different version to tell. This offended Peisistratus who felt there should be only one version of THE ILIAD, the official, authenticated, version. This he set out to create, or have created. He appointed a commission, or its equivalent for those days and assigned them the task of writing it down so no more changes could be made, and while they’re at it, eliminate, cut out, all those improvements made by inferior poets. This was done, and this is the version we have today. One might well ask, if THE ILIAD is based on previous material, and if it evolved before, during, and after Homer’s lifetime, why do we give Homer sole credit for authorship? This is a good question. One scholars have been dealing with for over 2000 years. Here is my opinion: Homer’s greatness lies not so much in his poetry, or in his selection of every word of THE ILIAD, and THE ODYSSEY. Though the selection of those words and the order in which he selected them make THE ILIAD one of the greatest works of art by man. His greatness lies in what he did to the art and craft of story telling. He made two improvements which changed forever the course of Western literature, and in some ways changed the way Man perceives himself. Since before the time of Homer and through to today, the art and craft of story telling is basically narrative. That is the story teller tells who, what, when, where, why, and how. He uses lots of colorful adjectives, and adverbs, throws in some sound bites and he has his story. The “news writer” of today working in television, or newspaper, uses the same art and craft. If he is a story teller of the Bronze age, he composes it in a poetic meter so that it may be more easily memorized and passed on. This “narrative” form has served well for thousands of years. Homer’s first improvement was to change the narrative form into what scholars today call the dramatic. That is he expands, and extends the “sound bite” from a quote describing what the person said into a prolonged speech which is spoken in the first person, present tense. These speeches allow the narrator to not just report what was said, but to become the person saying it. And, as he assumes the character, and expresses the passion of the speaker, the audience can see deep into the heart and soul of the character. They can see his hidden agendas, the honesty of his emotion, the truth of his motives, the value of his character. Homer’s second improvement was one which allowed the first one to work.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:bc6d0d4a-886d-49ee-9c0f-26597634f183>']}, {'passage': '\'The Iliad WASN\'T written by a man named Homer\': Historian claims the name referred to a group of storytellers - and that they lived 1,000 years earlier than thought\n- Adam Nicolson says Homer was a tradition of storytelling not a single man\n- He believes The Iliad is 1,000 years older than dates for when Homer lived\n- He says the poems began as stories that were shared and refined orally\n- He began studying Homer ten years ago after being caught in a storm\n- Mr Nicolson has written a book on how Homer should be interpreted today\nThe ancient Greek poet Homer was not a single person but actually an entire culture of storytelling, a historian has claimed.

He said: \'I think it\'s a mistake to think of Homer as a person. Homer is an ""it"" - a tradition. Adam Nicolson has written a book about what Homer can tell us about life in the modern world\n\'An entire culture coming up with ever more refined and ever more understanding ways of telling stories that are important to it.\' There is very little known about exactly who or what Homer was, but is believed by the ancient Greeks to have been the first great epic poet. Some accounts claim he was a blind poet who lived between 1,102BC to 850BC. A guild of singing story tellers, or rhapsodes, later emerged known as the Homeridae and has led some to argue that Homer was actually a mythical figure whose name was derived from the guild. Some of the earliest written works attributed to Homer were found with the mummified remains of Green Egyptians from around 150-200 BC. The oldest complete Iliad manuscript is found in the doge\'s library in Venice and is thought to date from 900AD. Mr Nicolson, who lives in Kent, said that notes in the margins of this manuscript, which was created in the Constantinople-Byzantium, provide some clues to what the origin of the Iliad may have been. He said: \'One of the exciting things that emerge from that is that in the early days it seems there was no such thing as a single Iliad, no one fixed text, but this wild and variable tradition of the stories, with many different versions in different parts of the Mediterranean, endlessly interacting with itself, like a braided stream in the mountains.\' Mr Nicolson said he first became interested in Homer around ten years ago when he began reading The Odyssey while waiting for his yacht to be repaired after it was damaged in a storm while sailing up the west coast of Britain. He describes reading The Odyssey as being like somebody \'telling me what it was like to be alive on Earth\'. Homer is depicted as a blind bard in this painting by Jean-Baptiste August Leloir, held at the Louvre in Paris\nEarly written accounts of The Iliad, like this 5th or 6th Century codex in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, are very rare and the stories are thought to have been passed down by oral storytelling for hundreds of years\nAdam Nicolson, seen here during his BBC series on the history of British whale hunting, first read Homer\'s Odyssey while waiting for repairs on his yacht and believes Odysseus is a \'metaphor for all of our lives\'\nLEGEND OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE WAS BASED ON REAL GOLD MINERS\nThe ancient Greek legend of Jason and his Argonauts\' quest for the Golden Fleece may have been based on a real expedition to an ancient kingdom on the Black Sea. The story is thought to have been in circulation even at the time of Homer and was thought to have been a myth.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:f98c6cde-acef-4749-8234-6e513e3b6aa0>']}, {'passage': 'When did Homer write the Iliad? Usually considered to have been written down circa the 8th century BC, the Iliad is among the oldest extant works of Western literature, along with the Odyssey, another epic poem attributed to Homer which tells of Odysseus’s experiences after the events of the Iliad. Is the Iliad older than the Bible? No. The Iliad and Odyssey predate the Bible by several hundred years. Was the Iliad written before the Odyssey? The Iliad is the earlier work (it was written first) .

Achilles was said to have died from a heel wound as the result of a poisoned arrow shot by Paris, Hector’s brother (see Figure 2). Is the Iliad true?

And once you get past the weird cultural details (reading the introduction to your edition will help), the poem is extremely accessible. The characters are vivid, and every reader will find someone to identify with. Is the Iliad a good read?

Frontispiece engraving for The Whole Works of Homer (1616) attributed to William Hole\nHitchin, Hertfordshire, England\n|Died||12 May 1634\n|Notable works||Bussy D\'Ambois, Translations of Homer|\nGeorge Chapman (c. 1559 – 12 May 1634) was an English dramatist, translator, and poet. He was a classical scholar whose work shows the influence of Stoicism. Chapman has been identified as the Rival Poet of Shakespeare\'s sonnets by William Minto, and as an anticipator of the Metaphysical Poets of the 17th century. Chapman is best remembered for his translations of Homer\'s Iliad and Odyssey, and the Homeric Batrachomyomachia. Life and work\nChapman was born at Hitchin in Hertfordshire. There is conjecture that he studied at Oxford but did not take a degree, though no reliable evidence affirms this. We know very little about Chapman\'s early life, but Mark Eccles uncovered records that reveal much about Chapman\'s difficulties and expectations. In 1585 Chapman was approached in a friendly fashion by John Wolfall, Sr., who offered to supply a bond of surety for a loan to furnish Chapman money ""for his proper use in Attendance upon the then Right Honorable Sir Rafe Sadler Knight."" Chapman\'s courtly ambitions led him into a trap. He apparently never received any money, but he would be plagued for many years by the papers he had signed. Wolfall had the poet arrested for debt in 1600, and when in 1608 Wolfall\'s son, having inherited his father\'s papers, sued yet again, Chapman\'s only resort was to petition the Court of Chancery for equity. As Sadler died in 1587 this gives Chapman little time to have trained under him, it seems more likely that he was in Sadler\'s household from 1577-83 as he dedicates all his Homerical translations to Sadler. He spent the early 1590s abroad, seeing military action in the Low Countries. His earliest published works were the obscure philosophical poems The Shadow of Night (1594) and Ovid\'s Banquet of Sense (1595). The latter has been taken as a response to the erotic poems of the age such as Philip Sidney\'s Astrophil and Stella and Shakespeare\'s Venus and Adonis. Chapman\'s life was troubled by debt and his inability to find a patron whose fortunes did not decline. Chapman\'s erstwhile patrons Robert Devereux, Second Earl of Essex and the Prince of Wales, Prince Henry, each met their ends prematurely; the former was executed for treason by Elizabeth I in 1601, and the latter died of typhoid fever at the age of eighteen in 1612. Chapman\'s resultant poverty did not diminish his ability or his standing among his fellow Elizabethan poets and dramatists. Chapman died in London, having lived his latter years in poverty and debt. He was buried at St Giles in the Fields, a monument to him designed by Inigo Jones marked his tomb, and stands today inside the church. By the end of the 1590s, Chapman had become a successful playwright, working for Philip Henslowe and later for the Children of the Chapel. Among his comedies are The Blind Beggar of Alexandria (1596; printed 1598), An Humorous Day\'s Mirth (1597; printed 1599), All Fools (printed 1605), Monsieur D\'Olive (1605; printed 1606), The Gentleman Usher (printed 1606) May Day (printed 1611), and The Widow\'s Tears (printed 1612). His plays show a willingness to experiment with dramatic form: An Humorous Day\'s Mirth was one of the first plays to be written in the style of \'humours comedy\' which Ben Jonson later used in Every Man in his Humour and Every Man Out of his Humour. With The Widow\'s Tears he was also one of the first writers to meld comedy with more serious themes, creating the tragicomedy later made famous by Beaumont and Fletcher. He also wrote one noteworthy play in collaboration. Eastward Ho (1605), written with Jonson and John Marston, contained satirical references to the Scots which landed Chapman and Jonson in jail.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:58ceca8e-8be6-4741-a419-2dc78e9a3cfd>']}, {'passage': ""Reviews for Iliad\nLibrary Journal Reviews 1990 August #1\nWhy another Iliad? Just as Homer's work existed most fully in its performance, so the Homeric texts call periodically for new translations. With this in mind, Fagles offers a new verse rendering of the Iliad. Maneuvering between the literal and the literary, he tries with varying degrees of success to suggest the vigor and manner of the original while producing readable poetry in English. Thus, he avoids the anachronizing of Robert Fitzgerald's translation, while being more literal than Richard Lattimore's.

While his admiration for Homer is always evident, he freely questioned the historical truth of The Iliad, asking why the Achaeans would wage so lengthy and costly a campaign as the Trojan War on behalf of one woman. This is only one of many examples of Herodotus’ personality displaying itself in his work. That he held himself in quite high regard is apparent in the prologue to the Histories which begins, “These are the researches of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, which he publishes, in the hope of thereby preserving from decay the remembrance of what men have done, and of preventing the great and wonderful actions of the Greeks and the Barbarians from losing their due meed of glory; and withal to put on record what were their grounds of feuds” (Histories, I.1). Unlike other ancient writers (such as Homer, earlier, or Virgil, later), Herodotus does not attribute his narrative to divine sources, nor call on such for assistance, but announces clearly that this is his work and no others. His high opinion of himself is also displayed in what is recorded as the first `publication’ of the Histories at the Olympic Games. Works at this time were `published’ by being read aloud and the Greek writer Lucian of Samosata (125-180 CE) claims that Herodotus read the entirety of his work to the audience in one sitting and received great applause. Another version of the publication of the work, however, claims that Herodotus refused to read his book to the crowd until there was ample cloud cover to shade him on the platform. While he waited, the audience left, and this event is what gave rise to the maxim, “Like Herodotus and his shade” (alluding to one who misses an opportunity by waiting for propitious circumstances). Whichever account is true, if either is, they both reflect the esteem Herodotus was known to hold himself in. While little is known of the details of his life, it seems certain that he came from a wealthy, aristocratic family in Asia Minor who could afford to pay for his education. His skill in writing is thought to be evidence of a thorough course in the best schools of his day. He wrote in Ionian Greek and was clearly well read. His ability to travel, seemingly at will, also argues for a man of some means. It is thought he served in the army as a Hoplite in that his descriptions of battle are quite precise and always told from the point of view of a foot soldier. He came to live in the Greek Colony of Thurii, in Italy, where he edited and revised the Histories later in life. He had also lived in Athens and, at some point, it is thought he returned there. Scholars consider it likely that he died in Athens of the plague sometime between 425 and 413 BCE. His fame was so great that many different cities (Athens and Thurii among them) claimed to be the site of his funeral and grave and monuments were erected in his honor. The lasting significance of his work continues to be appreciated by millions of people today and he is considered a primary source for reliable information on the ancient world he observed and wrote about.

                ""text"": ""From 1598 he published his translation of the Iliad in installments. In 1616 the complete Iliad and Odyssey appeared in The Whole Works of Homer, the first complete English translation, which until Pope's was the most popular in the English language and was the way most English speakers encountered these poems. The endeavour was to have been profitable: his patron, Prince Henry, had promised him \u00a3300 on its completion plus a pension. However, Henry died in 1612 and his household neglected the commitment, leaving Chapman without either a patron or an income. In an extant letter, Chapman petitions for the money owed him; his petition was ineffective. Chapman's translation of the Odyssey is written in iambic pentameter, whereas his Iliad is written in iambic heptameter. (The Greek original is in dactylic hexameter.) Chapman often extends and elaborates on Homer's original contents to add descriptive detail or moral and philosophical interpretation and emphasis. Chapman's translation of Homer was much admired by John Keats, notably in his famous poem On First Looking into Chapman's Homer, and also drew attention from Samuel Taylor Coleridge and T. S. Eliot. Chapman also translated the Homeric Hymns, the Georgics of Virgil, The Works of Hesiod (1618, dedicated to Francis Bacon), the Hero and Leander of Musaeus (1618), and the Fifth Satire of Juvenal (1624). There is no danger to a man, that knows\nWhat life and death is: there's not any law\nExceeds his knowledge; neither is it lawful\nThat he should stoop to any other law. The English poet John Keats wrote \""On First Looking into Chapman's Homer\"" for his friend Charles Cowden Clarke in October 1816. The poem begins \""Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold\"" and is much quoted. For example, P. G. Wodehouse in his review of the first Flashman novel that came to his attention: \""Now I understand what that 'when a new planet swims into his ken' excitement is all about.\"" Arthur Ransome uses two references from it in his children's books, the Swallows and Amazons series.

Just as Homer's work existed most fully in its performance, so the Homeric texts call periodically for new translations. With this in mind, Fagles offers a new verse rendering of the Iliad. Maneuvering between the literal and the literary, he tries with varying degrees of success to suggest the vigor and manner of the original while producing readable poetry in English. Thus, he avoids the anachronizing of Robert Fitzgerald's translation, while being more literal than Richard Lattimore's.

Adam Nicolson, an author and historian who has studied Homer, believes the epic poems of The Iliad and The Odyssey have their origins around 2,000 BC - 1,000 years earlier than the man who wrote them is said to have lived. Instead, he claims the stories evolved as a tradition that were shared and refined as spoken poems for hundreds of years. Little is known about who Homer, seen here in an idealised marble bust from the Roman period, really was\nSpeaking in an interview with National Geographic, Mr Nicolson, who is the Fifth Baron Carnock, said that the idea of Homer as a single author has emerged due to an 'author obsession'. He said: 'I think it's a mistake to think of Homer as a person. Homer is an \""it\"" - a tradition. Adam Nicolson has written a book about what Homer can tell us about life in the modern world\n'An entire culture coming up with ever more refined and ever more understanding ways of telling stories that are important to it.' There is very little known about exactly who or what Homer was, but is believed by the ancient Greeks to have been the first great epic poet. Some accounts claim he was a blind poet who lived between 1,102BC to 850BC. A guild of singing story tellers, or rhapsodes, later emerged known as the Homeridae and has led some to argue that Homer was actually a mythical figure whose name was derived from the guild. Some of the earliest written works attributed to Homer were found with the mummified remains of Green Egyptians from around 150-200 BC. The oldest complete Iliad manuscript is found in the doge's library in Venice and is thought to date from 900AD. Mr Nicolson, who lives in Kent, said that notes in the margins of this manuscript, which was created in the Constantinople-Byzantium, provide some clues to what the origin of the Iliad may have been. He said: 'One of the exciting things that emerge from that is that in the early days it seems there was no such thing as a single Iliad, no one fixed text, but this wild and variable tradition of the stories, with many different versions in different parts of the Mediterranean, endlessly interacting with itself, like a braided stream in the mountains.' Mr Nicolson said he first became interested in Homer around ten years ago when he began reading The Odyssey while waiting for his yacht to be repaired after it was damaged in a storm while sailing up the west coast of Britain. He describes reading The Odyssey as being like somebody 'telling me what it was like to be alive on Earth'. Homer is depicted as a blind bard in this painting by Jean-Baptiste August Leloir, held at the Louvre in Paris\nEarly written accounts of The Iliad, like this 5th or 6th Century codex in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, are very rare and the stories are thought to have been passed down by oral storytelling for hundreds of years\nAdam Nicolson, seen here during his BBC series on the history of British whale hunting, first read Homer's Odyssey while waiting for repairs on his yacht and believes Odysseus is a 'metaphor for all of our lives'\nLEGEND OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE WAS BASED ON REAL GOLD MINERS\nThe ancient Greek legend of Jason and his Argonauts' quest for the Golden Fleece may have been based on a real expedition to an ancient kingdom on the Black Sea. The story is thought to have been in circulation even at the time of Homer and was thought to have been a myth."",

Weather forecast: More rain may bring flooding to Middle Tennessee
City well above normal rainfall for February Wochit
More rain is expected to move into Middle Tennessee on Wednesday, which could be heavy at times over the next several days and cause some local flooding. Nashville has recorded 7.59 inches of rain in February through Tuesday, 4.79 inches above normal for the same time period according to National Weather Service meteorologist Faith Borden. The next several days could bring 2-3 inches of additional rain through Saturday for most of the region and possibly more in isolated areas, Borden said. Northwestern portions of Middle Tennessee may get the higher totals that could range from 3 to 5 inches of rain through Saturday. Slightly lesser amounts of rainfall are expected along the Cumberland Plateau with 1-2 inches forecast, according to the National Weather Service. A flood watch is in effect for multiple counties in the region that include Davidson, Sumner and Williamson, which Borden said could be extended. The Cumberland River in Nashville and Stones River in Donelson are elevated and with the rain forecast could return to above flood stage, Borden said. Severe weather isn’t expected, but thunderstorms are possible. It is NEVER safe to drive or walk into flood waters. Some safety tips for flooding conditions. Jessica Davis/USA TODAY NETWORK - Tennessee
The temperature stood at 71 degrees just before 7 a.m., in Nashville and is expected to fall into the upper 50s by early afternoon with a low forecast around 54 overnight, according to the weather service. Nashville set a record high temperature on Tuesday, reaching 80 degrees. Here is the National Weather Service forecast for the rest of the week:
Wednesday: An 80 percent chance of showers and possibly a thunderstorm with the temperature falling to around 57 by 1 p.m. New rainfall amounts between one-quarter and one-half inch are possible. Wednesday night: Showers and possibly a thunderstorm, some that could produce heavy rainfall. Low around 54. Chance of precipitation is 100%. New rainfall amounts between a half- and three-fourths of an inch are possible. Thursday: A 90 percent chance of rain and possibly a thunderstorm. High near 62. New rainfall amounts between three-fourths and one inch are possible. A 40 percent chance of showers Thursday night with a low around 60. Friday: A 50 percent chance of showers and thunderstorms. Mostly cloudy, with a high near 77. The chance of rain increases to 60 percent Friday night into Saturday. Saturday: An 80 percent chance of showers and thunderstorms with a high near 76. The chance of rain is around 90 percent Saturday night with a low around 55. Sunday: A 30 percent chance of showers before noon, then mostly sunny, with a high near 64.

Following a momentous announcement about the presence of water on the planet Mars, NASA scientists revealed yesterday that their recent efforts have also inadvertently uncovered the presence of water in Nashville’s Cumberland River. “Frankly, we were as surprised as anyone” explained NASA team leader Fred Jackson. “We had sent our prototype rovers into the Cumberland as a testing ground to see if they could handle the intense pressures and caustic environments that one might encounter in even the most inhospitable of planetary environs. But in exercising the sensors of those test probes, we made the remarkable discovery that there is water in the Cumberland! At first, we were sure that it had to be a faulty reading or a broken instrument, but seven different tests on multiple instruments confirmed the finding!”
NASA scientists revealed that their findings indicate that the Cumberland River’s elemental make-up contains a staggering 14% water content. The rest, they say, is a mix of spilled beer from Dancin’ In the District concerts in the 1990s, misplaced Red Bulls from various marathons and 5Ks, discarded flyers from your neighbor’s set at Tin Roof, an as-yet-unclassified semi-gaseous element which they are currently calling “Nashvillium”, and the tears of frustrated Titan’s fans. The science team claim they have been withholding their findings for several years until now, so as not to tip off the public that seeking water was an objective of their search on Mars.

Why Are Trees Important? - Trees slow down storm flow. - Trees reduce storm water runoff. - Trees filter pollutants. - Trees cool urban heat islands. - Trees beautify our communities. What Can Trees Do For Nashville? Nashville’s impervious surfaces have increased by 20% over the past 2 decades in urban areas at a cost in excess of $100 billion nationally. Local governments are increasingly looking toward non-built storm water management strategies, including trees to reduce the cost of constructing storm water control infrastructure. Some of the intercepted water evaporates back into the atmosphere, and some soaks into the ground reducing the total amount of runoff that must be managed in urban areas. Trees also slow storm flow, reducing the volume of water that a containment facility must store. For example, in the Metropolitan Washington DC region, the existing 46 % tree canopy reduces the need for retention structures by 949 million cubic feet, valued at $4.7 billion per 20-year construction cycle (based on a $5/cubic foot construction cost). What can I Do For Nashville's Urban Canopy? · Help Nashville get more roots in the ground! The Cumberland River Compact, Nashville Tree Foundation, and many other environmental non-profits in Nashville offer free trees from September – April each year. · Keep an eye out for Emerald Ash Borer and alert a Metro Tree Advisory member if you spot it! This tiny terror is responsible for wiping out Ash trees all over North America and is expected to cost Tennessee billions. Contact Root Nashville
for more information! OUR COMMITMENT TO RESTORING NASHVILLE’S URBAN CANOPY
Trees are a remarkably effective and low-cost solution to water pollution, so we are working with the Nashville Tree Foundation, the Tennessee Environmental Council, several Metro Nashville Departments, and a conglomerate other citizen groups to collectively restore Nashville’s tree canopy. The plan is to plant 500,000 trees between now and 2050, and we have committed to being responsible for at least 10,000 trees between 2016 and 2021. So far, we have planted approximately 6,000 trees and we plan to meet (and possibly exceed) our target of ten thousand before 2021! URBAN CANOPY MAINTENANCE PROGRAM
The restoration of our urban canopy is dependent upon regular watering of newly planted trees—especially during the first two summers. A recent survey of park trees planted in 2015 and 2016 showed a 60% survival rate; which indicates that newly planted trees with no maintenance plan in place are at a higher risk of fatality. So, we decided to start a program to do just that! We officially launched the long-awaited Urban Canopy Maintenance Program in December of 2017! This program was established to help care for young trees all over Nashville, and anyone can enroll their trees. Each maintenance package includes one year of watering, pruning, and data collection–and for every paid maintenance package, we are donating a year of maintenance to a tree in the area with greater impermeable surface area, lower canopy coverage, higher average surface temperatures, or socioeconomic disadvantage. There are thousands of trees planted every year in Nashville, and they need a lot of water in their first few years of life to establish a healthy root system. Unfortunately, they often don’t receive the care they require to flourish or even survive. The goal of the Urban Canopy Maintenance Program is to increase their survival rate so that Nashville can continue to restore and expand its urban canopy. PROGRAM FEES & BENEFITS
For each paid maintenance package, the Cumberland River Compact will donate one year of maintenance to a tree in need. $90/year per tree includes:
- Regular watering
- Pruning of suckers and shoots
- Data collection & reporting

TREE CARE TIPS
HOW OFTEN DO I NEED TO WATER MY TREE? Young trees need approximately one inch of water per week. During dry times it is important to water your tree at least once a week, sometimes even twice. Always water the tree slowly so the water has time to soak into the soil.

High surf usually associated with this level of flooding may pound some oceanside structures like piers, boardwalks, docks, and lifeguard stations apart. Beach houses may be damaged by water and surf, especially if lacking stilts. Major Flood Stage
- Rivers: significant to catastrophic, life-threatening flooding is usually expected at this stage. Extensive flooding with some low-lying areas completely inundated is likely. Structures may be completely submerged. Large-scale evacuations may be necessary. - Coastlines: Water surges over not only the dune, but also man-made walls and roads. Large and destructive waves pound weak structures to bits and severely damage well-built homes and businesses. Overwash occurs on high-level seawalls. If major flooding occurs at high tide, impacts may be felt well inland. If cities are at or below sea level, catastrophic flooding can inundate the entire city and cause millions or billions of dollars in damage (such as occurred in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina). Record Flood Stage
- Rivers: at this level, the river is at its highest that it has been since records began for the area where the stream gauge is located. This does not necessarily imply a major flood. Some areas may have never experienced major flooding, and thus record stage is in the moderate category. - Coastlines: Usually, record flooding at the coast is associated with tropical cyclones, but it may be associated with coastal storms, Nor'easters, seiches caused by earthquakes, strong thunderstorms, or tsunamis. Destruction is often extensive and may extend a far distance inland. - ""Glossary - National Weather Service"". weather.gov.

Service Estimates Economic Impact of Critical Habitat Designation for Fluted Kidneyshell and Slabside Pearlymussel
April 26, 2013
- Stephanie Chance, 931/528-6481, ext. 211, email@example.com
- Tom MacKenzie, 404/679-7291 firstname.lastname@example.org
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announces the availability of a draft economic analysis considering the impact of a proposal to designate critical habitat for two freshwater mussels proposed for listing as endangered. If the two species are listed, and if critical habitat is finalized as it is proposed, the draft economic analysis suggests a range of economic impacts that are possible as a result. In addition to opening a public comment period on the draft economic analysis, the Service is re-opening a public comment period on the proposal to designate critical habitat for these mussels under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) for 30 days by May 29, 2013, in order to allow comments on the draft analysis and the proposed critical habitat designation. The Service first released the proposed critical habitat designation for public comment in October 2012. The fluted kidneyshell and the slabside pearlymussel are only found in portions of the Cumberland and Tennessee River systems of Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia. They have both been eliminated from more than 60 percent of the total number of streams where they historically lived. Only a handful of populations of both species are considered biologically viable. The primary reasons for these mussels’ decline include impoundments, mining, oil and gas exploration, sedimentation, chemical contaminants, temperature alterations, recurring drought and flooding, population fragmentation and isolation, loss of fish hosts, and the introduced, invasive Asian clam. The economic analysis estimates the total incremental cost of critical habitat designation to be up to $3.5 million over 20 years. These costs stem from the requirement for federal agencies to consult with the Service regarding the impacts of their actions, or those that they fund or authorize, on critical habitat. Other sectors of the economy likely to be subject to the impacts include commercial, industrial, residential, utility development, agricultural, and recreational development. The majorities of these costs are administrative and may be borne by federal and state agencies; however, some costs may be incurred by local governments and businesses if federal funding or a federal permit is involved. Critical habitat is a term defined in the ESA. It refers to specific geographic areas that are essential to the conservation of a threatened or endangered species and which may require special management considerations or protection. The designation of critical habitat on private land has no impact on private landowner activities that do not require federal funding or permits. In total, the Service is proposing 27 critical habitat units encompassing 1,380 miles (2,218 km) in Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia for the fluted kidneyshell and slabside pearlymussel. Some of the units overlap and are proposed critical habitat for both species. Here are the proposed critical habitat designations for each mussel. For the fluted kidneyshell, the Service is proposing 24 critical habitat units encompassing 1,182 miles (1,899 km) of stream channel in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia. For the slabside pearlymussel, thirteen critical habitat units encompassing 971 miles (1,562 km) of stream channel in Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia are proposed for the slabside pearlymussel. The fluted kidneyshell’s proposed designation includes eight streams of unoccupied habitat. There are no unoccupied streams designated for the slabside pearlymussel. All streams proposed as critical habitat are occupied by one of these species, or by another previously listed mussel species. Unoccupied habitats provide additional habitat for population expansion and promote genetic diversity, which will decrease the risk of extinction for these two species. For example, the Elk, Holston, and French Broad rivers are being proposed as unoccupied critical habitat for the fluted kidneyshell. This species was once found in these areas.

TVA sought input from stakeholders, identified issues of importance, compared alternative operating policies, and provided opportunities for public review and comment. The TVA Board adopted the recommendations of the ROS in May 2004. A lowering of reservoir pool levels that is limited by one or more restrictions on the rate of change. A project that relies on the flow of a stream or river to produce hydropower but has little or no capacity to store water. (It is one of two major categories of projects, the other being storage.) Run-of-river projects pass water through a dam at nearly the same rate it enters the reservoir, so they have minimal seasonal changes in water levels. That portion of total rainfall that eventually enters a river. About 44 percent of rainfall in the drainage area of the Tennessee River system becomes runoff. Vertical slots, generally located near the bottom of a dam, which can be opened to release water from the upstream reservoir without passing it through the turbines. When the water at a dam is too low to reach the spillway, the sluiceway can be used to release water faster than it can flow through the turbines. A channel or passageway around or over a dam through which water is released, or “spilled,” past the dam without going through the turbines. Spillways at some dams are controlled with gates. At others, water flows over the top of the spillway automatically when the reservoir level gets to a certain elevation. A spillway is a safety valve for a dam; it can be used to discharge rainfall and runoff from major storms as necessary to maintain the reservoir below a predetermined maximum level. A reservoir that can be used to store water for a variety of purposes, such as flood damage reduction, power production, navigation, water supply, and recreation. The part of a river downstream from a dam, where the flow and quality of the water are substantially affected by the dam discharge. The variation of water temperature at different depths in a reservoir. The coldest water is typically the densest and is found at the bottom of the reservoir; the warmest water is at the surface. In the Tennessee Valley, reservoirs usually begin the process of stratification in spring and become highly stratified by May or June. The effect disappears by winter. Tennessee River system
The Tennessee River and its tributaries, which comprise a drainage area of about 41,000 square miles. It includes 125 counties that cover much of Tennessee and parts of Alabama, Kentucky, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Virginia. A power plant that produces electricity from heat energy released by the combustion of a fossil fuel (coal, oil, or gas) or the consumption of a fissionable material (nuclear fuel). Top of gates
The maximum controlled elevation at a project, typically the top of a spillway gate in a closed position or crest elevation of an uncontrolled outlet structure. A river or stream flowing into a larger stream. In this case it refers to the streams and rivers that eventually flow into the Tennessee River. Tributary storage reservoirs
Reservoirs located on tributaries of the Tennessee River whose operating policies include a provision for the reservation of flood storage. They include Norris, Douglas, South Holston, Boone, Cherokee, Watauga, Fontana, Tellico, Chatuge, Nottely, Hiwassee, Blue Ridge, Tims Ford, Normandy, Bear Creek, Little Bear Creek, and Cedar Creek. The lowering of reservoir levels with no restrictions on the rate of change. In a direction opposite to or against the stream's current.

For example, though there are a variety of methods to minimize the impact (including fish ladders and in-take screens), fish and other organisms can be injured and killed by turbine blades. Apart from direct contact, there can also be wildlife impacts both within the dammed reservoirs and downstream from the facility. Reservoir water is usually more stagnant than normal river water. As a result, the reservoir will have higher than normal amounts of sediments and nutrients, which can cultivate an excess of algae and other aquatic weeds. These weeds can crowd out other river animal and plant-life, and they must be controlled through manual harvesting or by introducing fish that eat these plants . In addition, water is lost through evaporation in dammed reservoirs at a much higher rate than in flowing rivers. In addition, if too much water is stored behind the reservoir, segments of the river downstream from the reservoir can dry out. Thus, most hydroelectric operators are required to release a minimum amount of water at certain times of year. If not released appropriately, water levels downstream will drop and animal and plant life can be harmed. In addition, reservoir water is typically low in dissolved oxygen and colder than normal river water. When this water is released, it could have negative impacts on downstream plants and animals. To mitigate these impacts, aerating turbines can be installed to increase dissolved oxygen and multi-level water intakes can help ensure that water released from the reservoir comes from all levels of the reservoir, rather than just the bottom (which is the coldest and has the lowest dissolved oxygen). Like many things we do, eat or get in contact with in our life, is not about absolute good or absolute bad. There are good practices and bad practices. The right thing in the wrong place generates conflicts as well as the opposite. Normally the main question is not what but instead how, how much and for how long.

The mixing of air and water, usually by bubbling air through water or by contact of water with air. The elevation that is used to help maintain a relative balance among tributary storage reservoirs. When water is drawn from tributary reservoirs, the balancing guide ensures that water is drawn equitably from each one, leaving the reservoirs at a similar position between the flood guide and the balancing guide. Cubic feet per second, typically used as a measure of flow in a stream. A cubic foot is equivalent to about 7.5 gallons. A measure of 1,000 cfs is equal to about 7,500 gallons of water per second. A marked nine-foot-draft navigation channel suitable for barge transportation on the Tennessee River and its tributaries. A measure of the volume of water accumulated at a flow rate of one cubic foot per second running for one day. A storage tank with a capacity of about 650,000 gallons would be required to store one day-second-foot of water. The oxygen dissolved in water that is necessary to sustain aquatic life. It is usually measured in milligrams per liter (mg/L) or parts per million (ppm). In the direction of a stream's current
The process of lowering the water level in a reservoir. Drawdown is usually measured in feet. The spring period of lessening runoff, when reservoirs are filled at a rate designed to maintain flood storage and reach targeted summer pool elevations
The volume, or capacity, in a reservoir that is reserved for the storage of floodwater. Flood guide level
The elevation of a reservoir above which the space is reserved for temporary storage of water to help reduce downstream flooding. Water that is located under the surface of the earth. The upstream portion of a watershed. The water elevation immediately upstream of a dam. The study of the distribution and movement of water. The transfer of water out of one river basin for the benefit of a public water system in another river basin. In 2005, the 11 interbasin transfers from the Tennessee River watershed diverted 13.6 million gallons per day. The amount of electric power that is drawn from TVA’s electric system at a given point in time. An enclosed dam chamber with gates at each end that allow water to be admitted and released. The resulting change in water level allows vessels to be raised and lowered so they can pass over non-navigable parts of a river. The locks on the Tennessee River make navigation possible for 652 miles, from Knoxville, Tennessee, to Paducah, Kentucky. Main-river, or main-stem, reservoirs
Reservoirs where the seasonal lowering to provide storage for flood damage reduction is typically less than seven feet. Main-river reservoirs include (upstream to downstream) Fort Loudoun, Watts Bar, Chickamauga, Nickajack, Guntersville, Wheeler, Wilson, Pickwick, and Kentucky. They were designed to serve multiple purposes, especially commercial navigation and hydropower production. An amount of energy that equals one million watt-hours. It is a common measure for electricity use over time. A release from one or more dams provided to meet hydropower production, reservoir level targets, downstream water needs (such as aquatic habitat, water supply, and waste assimilation), and other commitments. Project minimum flows are those required to be released from a specific dam over a specific time period — not the lowest amount of water that TVA can pass through a dam. System minimum flows are those needed at some point in the system to meet specific needs for power, waste assimilation, navigation, and other beneficial uses. Minimum operations guide
The system minimum operations guide is a seasonal guide based on the sum of the storage in 10 tributary projects. It is used to determine what level of flow should be released from these projects when additional flow is required to meet downstream needs. Normal operating zone
The elevation range within which main-river reservoirs are operated for power production and summer mosquito control. During high-flow periods, the top of the normal operating zone may be exceeded for the regulation of flood flows. A set of guidelines that includes flood guides, minimum flow requirements, water release requirements, and other requirements to meet system operating objectives. Reservoir (pool) level
The elevation of the water in a reservoir at a given time, measured in feet above sea level. Reservoir Operations Study
A study carried out by TVA to determine whether changes in its reservoir operating policies would produce greater overall public value.

The consequences of the actual amount of warming that we expect to experience are horrifying, and are likely to include 80 to 250 feet of sea level rise and a dust bowl from Kansas to California
Mr. Romm next provides a litany of very bad things that he predicts are likely to occur if we do not implement a set of policies to aggressively restrict emissions. Consider Mr. Romm’s first prediction:
- Sea level rise of 80 feet to 250 feet at a rate of 6 inches a decade (or more). A 250 foot rise in sea level would be very, very bad. It conjures up the image of massive tidal waves consuming major coastal cities. But this forecast is problematic for at least a couple of reasons. First, I don’t understand its internal logic. At 6 inches per decade, it would take 1,600 years to get to 80 feet, and 5,000 years to get to 250 feet. I assume we are not trying to consider effects in the years 3600 AD to 7000 AD. Second, while Mr. Romm doesn’t provide attribution for this forecast, it isn’t anything like any formal prediction I’ve ever seen from the IPCC. The IPCC is appropriately reserved about making predictions for sea level rise. They don’t provide best estimates by scenario, but just broad ranges. They also caution that the high end of any range is not an absolute maximum. The spread of IPCC projections for sea level rise through about 2100 across all six marker scenarios ranges from a low of 0.18 meters to a high of 0.59 meters. (See WG1 SPM, Table SPM.3) Crudely, these average about 0.4 meters, or about 15 inches total by about 2100. That’s quite a ways from 80 to 250 feet. Consider Mr. Romm’s second prediction:
Mr. Romm links to a blog post about a news report about a single climate simulation model study to support this. (Read the comments section on the page to which Mr. Romm links). The IPCC certainly does make predictions that large amounts of land, especially in Latin America (See WG2 Chapter 13, pages 583 and 597) and some other equatorial areas, will be subject to “desertification processes,” and this would be a serious problem, but I have not seen a claim as dramatic as Mr. Romm’s proceed from the IPCC process. Consider this in the context of Mr. Romm’s closely related prediction, also based on a blog citation of another single study using climate simulation models, for aridity impacts for the U.S.:
…”a permanent drought by 2050 throughout the Southwest” – levels of aridity comparable to the 1930s Dust Bowl would stretch from Kansas to California. And they were only looking at a 720 ppm case! This is a pretty bleak picture of what, for example, the U.S. will look like: a 21st century army of Joads escaping an interior apocalypse, only to arrive at the coasts to find the cities flooded under hundreds of feet of water. In contrast, here is the complete list of “examples of projected impacts” that the IPCC provides to illustrate the effects of climate change for the continent of North America (See Synthesis Report, Summary for Policymakers, page 11):
- Warming in western mountains is projected to cause decreased snowpack, more winter flooding and reduced summer flows, exacerbating competition for over-allocated water resources. - In the early decades of the century, moderate climate change is projected to increase aggregate yields of rain-fed agriculture by 5 to 20%, but with important variability among regions. Major challenges are projected for crops that are near the warm end of their suitable range or which depend on highly utilized water resources. - Cities that currently experience heat waves are expected to be further challenged by an increased number, intensity and duration of heat waves during the course of the century, with potential for adverse health impacts. - Coastal communities and habitats will be increasingly stressed by climate change impacts interacting with development and pollution. While serious, this doesn’t sound quite so dramatic. And so on with various other of Mr. Romm’s predictions. The negative consequences of a several degree increase in global temperatures would almost certainly be quite significant. In addition, these consequences would likely be felt disproportionately by poor people in developing countries, especially those near the equator. Exaggerating these effects, however, is not helpful.","[{'passage': 'Nashville weather: Sunny skies finally here on Sunday, but river flood threat remains into next week\nCarmen Klapper had barely any warning before a flash flood hit the RV park her family was staying in Saturday evening.

What Can Trees Do For Nashville? Nashville’s impervious surfaces have increased by 20% over the past 2 decades in urban areas at a cost in excess of $100 billion nationally. Local governments are increasingly looking toward non-built storm water management strategies, including trees to reduce the cost of constructing storm water control infrastructure. Some of the intercepted water evaporates back into the atmosphere, and some soaks into the ground reducing the total amount of runoff that must be managed in urban areas. Trees also slow storm flow, reducing the volume of water that a containment facility must store. For example, in the Metropolitan Washington DC region, the existing 46 % tree canopy reduces the need for retention structures by 949 million cubic feet, valued at $4.7 billion per 20-year construction cycle (based on a $5/cubic foot construction cost).

OUR COMMITMENT TO RESTORING NASHVILLE’S URBAN CANOPY\nTrees are a remarkably effective and low-cost solution to water pollution, so we are working with the Nashville Tree Foundation, the Tennessee Environmental Council, several Metro Nashville Departments, and a conglomerate other citizen groups to collectively restore Nashville’s tree canopy. The plan is to plant 500,000 trees between now and 2050, and we have committed to being responsible for at least 10,000 trees between 2016 and 2021. So far, we have planted approximately 6,000 trees and we plan to meet (and possibly exceed) our target of ten thousand before 2021! URBAN CANOPY MAINTENANCE PROGRAM\nThe restoration of our urban canopy is dependent upon regular watering of newly planted trees—especially during the first two summers. A recent survey of park trees planted in 2015 and 2016 showed a 60% survival rate; which indicates that newly planted trees with no maintenance plan in place are at a higher risk of fatality. So, we decided to start a program to do just that! We officially launched the long-awaited Urban Canopy Maintenance Program in December of 2017! This program was established to help care for young trees all over Nashville, and anyone can enroll their trees. Each maintenance package includes one year of watering, pruning, and data collection–and for every paid maintenance package, we are donating a year of maintenance to a tree in the area with greater impermeable surface area, lower canopy coverage, higher average surface temperatures, or socioeconomic disadvantage. There are thousands of trees planted every year in Nashville, and they need a lot of water in their first few years of life to establish a healthy root system. Unfortunately, they often don’t receive the care they require to flourish or even survive. The goal of the Urban Canopy Maintenance Program is to increase their survival rate so that Nashville can continue to restore and expand its urban canopy.

If the two species are listed, and if critical habitat is finalized as it is proposed, the draft economic analysis suggests a range of economic impacts that are possible as a result. In addition to opening a public comment period on the draft economic analysis, the Service is re-opening a public comment period on the proposal to designate critical habitat for these mussels under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) for 30 days by May 29, 2013, in order to allow comments on the draft analysis and the proposed critical habitat designation. The Service first released the proposed critical habitat designation for public comment in October 2012. The fluted kidneyshell and the slabside pearlymussel are only found in portions of the Cumberland and Tennessee River systems of Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia. They have both been eliminated from more than 60 percent of the total number of streams where they historically lived. Only a handful of populations of both species are considered biologically viable. The primary reasons for these mussels’ decline include impoundments, mining, oil and gas exploration, sedimentation, chemical contaminants, temperature alterations, recurring drought and flooding, population fragmentation and isolation, loss of fish hosts, and the introduced, invasive Asian clam. The economic analysis estimates the total incremental cost of critical habitat designation to be up to $3.5 million over 20 years. These costs stem from the requirement for federal agencies to consult with the Service regarding the impacts of their actions, or those that they fund or authorize, on critical habitat. Other sectors of the economy likely to be subject to the impacts include commercial, industrial, residential, utility development, agricultural, and recreational development. The majorities of these costs are administrative and may be borne by federal and state agencies; however, some costs may be incurred by local governments and businesses if federal funding or a federal permit is involved. Critical habitat is a term defined in the ESA. It refers to specific geographic areas that are essential to the conservation of a threatened or endangered species and which may require special management considerations or protection. The designation of critical habitat on private land has no impact on private landowner activities that do not require federal funding or permits. In total, the Service is proposing 27 critical habitat units encompassing 1,380 miles (2,218 km) in Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia for the fluted kidneyshell and slabside pearlymussel. Some of the units overlap and are proposed critical habitat for both species. Here are the proposed critical habitat designations for each mussel. For the fluted kidneyshell, the Service is proposing 24 critical habitat units encompassing 1,182 miles (1,899 km) of stream channel in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia. For the slabside pearlymussel, thirteen critical habitat units encompassing 971 miles (1,562 km) of stream channel in Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia are proposed for the slabside pearlymussel. The fluted kidneyshell’s proposed designation includes eight streams of unoccupied habitat. There are no unoccupied streams designated for the slabside pearlymussel. All streams proposed as critical habitat are occupied by one of these species, or by another previously listed mussel species. Unoccupied habitats provide additional habitat for population expansion and promote genetic diversity, which will decrease the risk of extinction for these two species. For example, the Elk, Holston, and French Broad rivers are being proposed as unoccupied critical habitat for the fluted kidneyshell.

Apart from direct contact, there can also be wildlife impacts both within the dammed reservoirs and downstream from the facility. Reservoir water is usually more stagnant than normal river water. As a result, the reservoir will have higher than normal amounts of sediments and nutrients, which can cultivate an excess of algae and other aquatic weeds. These weeds can crowd out other river animal and plant-life, and they must be controlled through manual harvesting or by introducing fish that eat these plants . In addition, water is lost through evaporation in dammed reservoirs at a much higher rate than in flowing rivers. In addition, if too much water is stored behind the reservoir, segments of the river downstream from the reservoir can dry out. Thus, most hydroelectric operators are required to release a minimum amount of water at certain times of year. If not released appropriately, water levels downstream will drop and animal and plant life can be harmed. In addition, reservoir water is typically low in dissolved oxygen and colder than normal river water. When this water is released, it could have negative impacts on downstream plants and animals. To mitigate these impacts, aerating turbines can be installed to increase dissolved oxygen and multi-level water intakes can help ensure that water released from the reservoir comes from all levels of the reservoir, rather than just the bottom (which is the coldest and has the lowest dissolved oxygen). Like many things we do, eat or get in contact with in our life, is not about absolute good or absolute bad. There are good practices and bad practices.

Consider Mr. Romm’s first prediction:\n- Sea level rise of 80 feet to 250 feet at a rate of 6 inches a decade (or more). A 250 foot rise in sea level would be very, very bad. It conjures up the image of massive tidal waves consuming major coastal cities. But this forecast is problematic for at least a couple of reasons. First, I don’t understand its internal logic. At 6 inches per decade, it would take 1,600 years to get to 80 feet, and 5,000 years to get to 250 feet. I assume we are not trying to consider effects in the years 3600 AD to 7000 AD. Second, while Mr. Romm doesn’t provide attribution for this forecast, it isn’t anything like any formal prediction I’ve ever seen from the IPCC. The IPCC is appropriately reserved about making predictions for sea level rise. They don’t provide best estimates by scenario, but just broad ranges. They also caution that the high end of any range is not an absolute maximum. The spread of IPCC projections for sea level rise through about 2100 across all six marker scenarios ranges from a low of 0.18 meters to a high of 0.59 meters. (See WG1 SPM, Table SPM.3) Crudely, these average about 0.4 meters, or about 15 inches total by about 2100. That’s quite a ways from 80 to 250 feet. Consider Mr. Romm’s second prediction:\nMr. Romm links to a blog post about a news report about a single climate simulation model study to support this. (Read the comments section on the page to which Mr. Romm links). The IPCC certainly does make predictions that large amounts of land, especially in Latin America (See WG2 Chapter 13, pages 583 and 597) and some other equatorial areas, will be subject to “desertification processes,” and this would be a serious problem, but I have not seen a claim as dramatic as Mr. Romm’s proceed from the IPCC process. Consider this in the context of Mr. Romm’s closely related prediction, also based on a blog citation of another single study using climate simulation models, for aridity impacts for the U.S.:\n…”a permanent drought by 2050 throughout the Southwest” – levels of aridity comparable to the 1930s Dust Bowl would stretch from Kansas to California. And they were only looking at a 720 ppm case! This is a pretty bleak picture of what, for example, the U.S. will look like: a 21st century army of Joads escaping an interior apocalypse, only to arrive at the coasts to find the cities flooded under hundreds of feet of water. In contrast, here is the complete list of “examples of projected impacts” that the IPCC provides to illustrate the effects of climate change for the continent of North America (See Synthesis Report, Summary for Policymakers, page 11):\n- Warming in western mountains is projected to cause decreased snowpack, more winter flooding and reduced summer flows, exacerbating competition for over-allocated water resources. - In the early decades of the century, moderate climate change is projected to increase aggregate yields of rain-fed agriculture by 5 to 20%, but with important variability among regions. Major challenges are projected for crops that are near the warm end of their suitable range or which depend on highly utilized water resources. - Cities that currently experience heat waves are expected to be further challenged by an increased number, intensity and duration of heat waves during the course of the century, with potential for adverse health impacts. - Coastal communities and habitats will be increasingly stressed by climate change impacts interacting with development and pollution. While serious, this doesn’t sound quite so dramatic. And so on with various other of Mr. Romm’s predictions. The negative consequences of a several degree increase in global temperatures would almost certainly be quite significant. In addition, these consequences would likely be felt disproportionately by poor people in developing countries, especially those near the equator. Exaggerating these effects, however, is not helpful.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:3a3782a7-7a8e-4ec6-a3d3-418ad8ba1154>']}]","{

Cumberland didn't set flood record, but Harpeth did\nThousands of Middle Tennessee homeowners and business owners will spend this week \u2014 and in some cases much longer \u2014 working to recover from a weekend of widespread flooding that came as the result of two days of record-setting rainfall in Nashville. Nashville's tourism industry has taken a huge one-two punch: Gaylord Opryland is inundated and likely won't reopen for months, and flooding has also shut down downtown attractions like the Wildhorse Saloon. Power has also been knocked out to much of downtown after flooding knocked out Nashville Electric Service\u2019s substation on Demonbreun Street. Damage estimates aren't yet available, but are expected to be high thanks to the historic nature of the flooding. The Cumberland River crested at 51.86 feet in Nashville according to the National Weather Service. That's nearly 12 feet above flood stage. Nashville's biggest flood, in 1929, saw the Cumberland River hit 56.2 feet. The river had fallen to 50.1 feet as of Tuesday morning, and levels in Nashville continue to drop slowly, the Mayor's Office said Tuesday night. The Army Corps of Engineers continues to release water from Old Hickory and Percy Priest Dam, but the releases are not expected to raise the level of the river. The goal is to get the river below its flood stage \u2014 40 feet \u2014 within the next few days, the Mayor's Office said. Other local waterways set records: The Harpeth River at Bellevue crested at 27.3, three feet higher than the previous record set in 1948; the Harpeth below Franklin crested at 32.3 feet, 3.3 feet higher than the previous record set in 1994; Mill Creek in Antioch crested at 26.1 feet, 3.3 feet higher than in 1979; Mill Creek at Woodbine crested at 21.4 feet, nearly a foot higher than in 1979; and the Duck River in Centerville crested at 47.5 feet, nearly 10 feet higher than the record set in 2003. The National Weather Service reported that Saturday and Sunday's rainfall totals were 13.57 inches at the Nashville International Airport \u2014 more than doubling the previous two-day record rainfall of 6.68 inches set in September 1979. As of May 3, the month already was the fifth-wettest month on record for Nashville. The weather service doesn't expect any more rainfall until Friday, when a chance of light rain is forecast. Several area communities, including Franklin and Bellevue, were among the hardest hit. At least 18 Tennessee deaths have been blamed on the weekend's storms, including nine in Davidson County. Mayor Karl Dean urged residents to avoid areas with standing water, saying that some people have been swept to their deaths after misjudging the danger. The body of Billy F. Rutledge, 70, of Graybar Lane was found Monday afternoon in a wooded area behind Kroger on Harding Road. His 65-year-old wife, Mary Rutledge, was found hundreds of yards away. Officials believe the couple had been trying to drive to church on Sunday when their car was swept from Harding Road. Detectives also found the body of Mary Jane McCormack, 86, inside her home on Sawyer Brown Road in River Plantation.

                ""text"": ""Currently, three issues are relevant:\nFixing The Dam\nThe Corps of Engineers, Nashville District has an approved plan to address serious seepage at Center Hill Dam and has obtained Federal funds for design and construction of a long term fix. Construction began in 2008 and is scheduled to be completed by 2014. Four large construction contracts are planned. The first contract was recently awarded to address the most critical parts of the dam affected by seepage, the earthen embankment of the main dam and the left rim (to the southwest of the dam). Throughout construction we will continue to closely monitor the dam. - Lake Levels throughout Construction\nThe seepage problems are made worse during continual high lake levels; therefore, maintaining lower lake elevations is necessary until we get a permanent remedy in place. Since March of 2005, we have attempted to keep fall, winter and early spring lake levels from extreme rises. We have also attempted to operate the lake on the low end of our normal annual operating band. During construction, however, the Corps plans to target Center Hill Lake levels between elevation 630 feet above mean sea level (msl) in the summer and no lower than elevation 618 msl during the late fall and early winter. These elevations are approximately five to ten feet lower than recent pool operating levels, and as much as eighteen feet lower than normal operating levels. During the five year repair period, this interim pool operation will be periodically re-evaluated to determine if Center Hill Lake can be safely raised, maintained, or if further lowering is necessary to ensure safety. The chosen levels are the result of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) developed over the past year. The EIS evaluated potential impacts caused by each of nine lake level alternatives. The process included consideration of safety concerns, potential impact to project purposes, and the views of the State of Tennessee, other federal agencies, affected stakeholders, and the public. The goal of the EIS was to identify an alternative that balanced the safety of the downstream human and natural environment against the reduction of project benefits from water supply, water quality, recreation, navigation, and hydropower. Emergency Action and Information\nAlthough not anticipated, there are events that could cause the Corps to lower the lake as an emergency action. Your County Emergency Managers have maps of areas which could flood if Center Hill Dam were to fail. The Corps has an aggressive Dam Safety program to constantly monitor all of our dams in the Cumberland River system and Center Hill is being monitored constantly. Lower lake levels have slowed the seepage progression. The Corps will use news articles, websites, and public meetings to keep the public informed of the dam\u2019s condition and of progress of the foundation remedy throughout construction. Accurate and timely information is critical to the effective resolution of many issues associated with Corps of Engineers projects. This web site has been established to provide information you need to stay informed. The site will be updated, based on the needs of our site visitors. Please let us know what you need. Please share this site with others interested in this project."",

By Nate Kessman
The advent of new technology coupled with an increasing focus on sustainability and tightening regulations has all led to the broadening of the facility management role. Due to these factors, many facility executives are beginning to oversee more departments than they had in the past. Responsibilities may now include directing maintenance and facility staff as well as overseeing security, janitorial, or groundskeeping crews and duties. As facilities improve their engineering, architectural services, and IT and telecom systems, the facility professional’s responsibilities become more abundant and specialized. Energy purchasing has traditionally been, and continues to be, an important aspect of facility management. A focus on key performance indicators (KPIs) and budgeting for expenses both known and unknown are key components to a facility professional’s toolkit. According to National Grid, energy represents about 19% of total expenditures for a typical office building. With lighting, heating, and cooling consuming 54-71% of total energy use depending on climate, this raises the question: What steps are successful facility managers taking to control and reduce these costs? Here are five common mistakes facility professionals should avoid:
1. Being an “energy manager” instead of a “facility manager:”
Your time should be focused on your facility’s KPIs, so working with an energy partner that you can easily communicate your ideas and goals, along with one who understands your tolerance for risk, is key. Inevitably all energy contracts expire. It’s crucial to know how renewal will be handled as well as what the contract indicates will happen to your rate structure at the end of a given contract. Does the supply service default to a volatile variable rate in the middle of the summer or winter? Or, will you be back in the hands of the local utility service at the end of the term? Although not as prevalent, there is also a possibility that your contract will renew on a fixed rate and term. Using an energy partner allows you the advantage of having a dedicated advisor work on your behalf and will manage renewals to avoid high risk pricing scenarios. 2. Overlooking benchmarking energy and water usage:
The process of documenting and filing energy and water usage through the U.S. ENERGY STAR website should be the first step towards efficiency. Benchmarking provides a base number for energy usage and costs, while also comparing your property to similar properties in the area. Once you have baseline numbers you can begin to compare usage and cost year over year to determine whether or not the facility is following a sustainable plan, or if you should reevaluate your energy usage. 3. Settling for the “lowest price:”
We all know that pricing is an important factor when it comes to commodity procurement, but it shouldn’t be the most important factor. Oftentimes contract terms and supplier flexibility over the long-term will outweigh the short-term benefit of a low price. Bandwidth and usage restrictions (penalties for using more or less energy during a certain period of time) can be devastating during periods of severe weather, so make sure that bandwidth restrictions are structured and priced to fit your needs. Paying a bit more today might help avoid unwanted charges in the future. 4. Not addressing efficiency projects in order of importance:
Lighting and HVAC can eat up to 70 cents for every dollar spent on energy. If you are looking at co-generation systems and haven’t upgraded all of the lighting in your facility yet, or invested in the most efficient HVAC equipment, it might be time to pump the brakes. Work with your advisor to develop a plan that acts as a roadmap for projects and sets realistic goals in regards to efficiency and usage reductions. It makes no sense putting a Ferrari engine in a Volkswagen. Look at the largest most expensive projects only after other projects have been completed. 5. Ignoring the sun:
Solar arrays (power systems designed to supply usable solar power) work to offset both electricity consumption and demand costs by producing electricity using solar panels that store captured energy in batteries. This option also reduces your carbon footprint because the electricity being produced doesn’t use fossil fuels. Solar energy can be a key component in a business becoming more sustainable. Understanding that the long-term savings are significant, it’s important to be aware that solar arrays do carry upfront costs, which will depend on the size of the system and specific application. Solar PV systems (solar power by means of photovoltaics) can cost up to $7 per installed watt.

In order to improve the sustainability of the planet, the area of Sustainability Jobs integrates social science, environmental science, and civil engineering. The demand for highly educated professionals to research and adopt more sustainable methods is greater than ever. In this post, we explain sustainability and give a rundown of degrees and employment available in the area. 1. An urbanist
Urban planners’ main responsibilities are to help businesses and organisation create plans for the use of land. In the designs of an urban planner, communities, road networks, parks, and the general layout of a city might frequently be given priority. Urban planners also create policies or strategies to handle expanding populations while having the least possible negative environmental effects. 2. Landscape designer
In order to integrate man-made structures smoothly with the environment, landscape architects first conduct a survey of the area’s natural geology and topography. It is possible for landscape architects to work on creating animal habitats, distinctive locations, or long-lasting infrastructure systems in both urban and rural settings. 3. Environmental geologists
Researching alternate sources of energy and resources is a crucial component of projects pertaining to Sustainability Jobs. An environmental geologist is crucial when advising mining and gas corporations on the acquisition and use of energy resources. 4. Environmental advisor
An environmental consultant often works on a contract basis with companies in the public or private sectors, such as water treatment plants, environmental agencies, and other businesses whose operations may have an impact on the environment. Environmental consultants can offer advice and planning solutions for issues including soil contamination, air quality, and water pollution. 5. Environmental scientist
Environmental scientists search for the most effective ways to safeguard the environment and advance human health. Environmental scientists frequently conduct research into health and environmental issues, seek to pinpoint their root causes, and develop solutions for these issues in both the public and commercial sectors. An environmental scientist could investigate and examine enigmatic diseases, strange wildlife malformations, or sickness in a population with an unidentified source. Ecologists’ main responsibilities are to investigate and address how human behavior affects and influences the environment. An ecologist may work for environmental nonprofits, doing study and developing solutions to environmental issues brought on by human activity, consumption, and influence on the environment. Ecologists may even be a member of a research team that examines and investigates how community actions such as construction, restoration, and others affect ecosystems. 7. Air quality engineer
Air quality engineers employ advanced monitoring procedures, chemical and statistical studies, and three-dimensional computer modelling to analyse the air pollution in a specific location. Air quality engineers occasionally develop or alter pollution-control machinery. In order to assess and study the effects of certain activities on the local surroundings, air quality engineers typically focus their efforts in or near big cities. 8. Engineering in the environment
Primary responsibilities: Environmental engineers provide solutions to environmental problems by combining environmental information with engineering concepts. Examples of environmental knowledge include soil composition and biological and ecological processes. Environmental engineers may work on initiatives or programmes to enhance public health, waste management and recycling, as well as initiatives to reduce or regulate air and water pollution. 9. Energy supervisor
The main responsibilities of energy managers are audits to guarantee effective use of resources, both financial and environmental. They could work for the government or the business sector. In the majority of cases, energy managers discover that the creation of new city projects, municipal plans, and governmental contracts requires their services. Energy managers may also be in charge of reducing the amount of energy and water used by creating projects that adhere to tight design guidelines, statutory requirements, and financial constraints. 10. Engineer in sustainability
A sustainability engineer’s main responsibilities include developing strategies, evaluating locations, and studying financial data to create and implement renewable energy projects. Although Sustainability Jobs engineers often operate inside, they occasionally need to travel to certain job sites in order to effectively formulate task designs, comprehend necessary job specifications, and get more familiar with the project at hand. Many businesses provide Sustainability Jobs employment, which give the environment hope for a bright future. The prognosis for employment in sustainability will also continue to improve as the population continues to grow and businesses and organisation search for innovative methods to develop, manufacture, and utilise fuel resources in environmentally appropriate applications.

He has undertaken investigations in the region relating to the energy market, mining, oil & gas downstream and civil airports. In the Middle East, he has good knowledge of the construction market, the processes and market players, especially in Qatar and Southern Iraq. He has experience with US, UK and EU codes and norms, applicable in the region. He is aware of the processes within many businesses, related to the technical infrastructure of buildings and other entities and the city streets technologies. He has a deep technical expertise, mainly in electrical equipment, and also in gas and water electrical machines. He intends to specialize in Energy Management relating to indoor entities: offices; hotels; shopping malls and also in the solar generation business. In order to implement the Energy Management process, I am going to apply the Standard ISO50001, which is based on the continual improvement cycle plan-do-check-act. The process will be incorporated in daily activities of the organization. The energies as water, air (compressed), oil & gas, electricity, heating & cooling, steam and their demand management require proper data gathering, processing and plan delivery. The existing theoretical frame and benchmark from global industry will show us what exactly data shall be gathered. I propose the research to be done from several perspectives – organizational, technical, chronological, etc. In case of good availability of data: as annual report, production data, organization chart, general policy, assets layout, utilities, procedures, facilities, significant energy users, contracts with energy, raw materials and services suppliers, I will do operational and technical predominantly quantitative analysis and propose monitoring system. If reliable information is missing, I will start with a usage of any available general information. Judgments on the performance can be done based on the information from the significant energy users, or facts as lamps switched-on in day time or water is running constantly in the toilet or air-conditioner is cycling. The hypothesis from those is that the organization lacks energy awareness and its influence on the cost. A collection of similar data, allows grouping and analysis. The analysis can be also qualitative, through surveys among employees or clients. If people say, that it is too hot and they open the windows frequently, the problem is obvious. The interviews can be done at random among the organization or sampling one department only. For analysis I will use regression and correlation approaches, mixing data from both, organizational and technical frames. For example if top Management declares full contribution to the execution of the Energy Management plan, the difference of water consumption in next quarter to be checked as a prove for such contribution. The Energy Management plan will be prepared as a result of gathering, processing and analysis of data and will provide outcomes – baseline, energy performance indicators, objectives, targets, short-term and long-term goals and action plans, for delivering improved energy usage results. Some improvement will be implemented immediately, others require investment decision. The energy usage and procurement policy will be described; the role of top management and energy team will be listed. Energy goals will be supported by metering, to be stipulated which ones. The improvement opportunities could be – new procedures, performance improvement, business process review, operations review, identification and elimination of waste, etc. I will set in the plan also a time frame and milestones, responsibilities and verification of the results and all will be documented. Ethical and security considerations will be done also, as some of the information, would be confidential or secret. The ultimate task of the plan is to make obvious the ways that energy is used, thus to increase cost awareness of the organization, followed by implementation of constant improvements of the energy demand and usage. There are plenty of technologies in any part of the business; the main barrier for change implementation in any organization are the employees or/and the management. I will propose measures to overcome barriers – resistance to change, lack of technical knowledge; potential savings are not recognizable, poor realization, lack of systematic approach. Those measures will lead to development of the people, improving their competence, basic technical knowledge and skills and energy demand awareness. If necessary, those training will be done under my personal guidance, as they are critical success factors. Another important task is the development of an energy use profile, to demonstrate how energy use is distributed among the company facilities, as well as identify the energy source for each system. Sub-metering can be provided for the systems to further analyse the systems and to identify further reduction opportunities.

One more year, the energy manager’s priority is to close more energy efficiency management projects. But while they have the project in their hands, where do they find the greatest difficulties? What challenges do they face during the energy management process? These are some of the questions from our annual survey on the state of energy management 2019, and this is what they answered…
For the 4º consecutive year, DEXMA has carried out its annual study on the current state of energy management. Every year we obtain very valuable data such as, for example, the PRIORITIES of the energy manager for 2019, in whose question 46% of the +300 surveyed have as their main objective to close more efficiency projects. 25% say they give priority to improving energy efficiency in the projects they already manage. One of the conclusions we have drawn from the results of the survey is that their priorities are closely related to their challenges. You will understand this when you discover the 3 main challenges faced during energy management processes. TOP 3 Challenges facing the Energy Manager in 2019
The question posed to the +300 professionals surveyed was, what is the biggest challenge for you in the energy management process as a manager? Of the 6 options that participants had to choose from, these were the TOP 3:
1. Identify and close new projects
A 22% marked as their biggest challenge to be able to identify and close new projects. Although this is at the same time the priority of 46% of the professionals surveyed, it is not the main challenge for everyone. It is clear that the task of closing new projects is not an easy one. I’m going to put you in 3 different situations, which you may feel identified with:
Situation 1: Difficulties in calculating return on investment (ROI). Imagine that you get a customer who needs to reduce their energy costs, and you plan to carry out an energy management project. The first thing the client will want to know is, how much is this going to cost me? Here, more than how much it is going to cost, you have to make them see it and clearly understand “how much it is going to benefit them”. So you will show them the ROI of the project. Here you can observe another of the challenges of the energy manager, which is how to calculate the ROI of your projects to show their viability to customers and/or financial managers. To give you a hand in this arduous task we provide you with a free downloadable template, which will help you to calculate the budget and ROI of your projects in a simple way. Situation 2: Lack of interest on the part of management. Now let’s put ourselves in a different situation. This time you have your whole plan presented. The person in charge of the management or the technician of the company is convinced that carrying out the project is a great idea, but … do the management think the same? Does the financier of the company see it that way and will give the approval to finance it? Here you will find another barrier to jump, convincing management and/or financiers. You must explain the benefits of an efficient energy management project for them. Show them the numbers, what the expenses and the ROI will be. This is the way they can see it clearly, the language of numbers. So, prepare yourself a good analysis and show the numbers, they love the numbers. For the best results, rely on adequate technology, such as an energy management solution that detects, analyses and controls energy data. Situation 3: Lack of funding
Energy managers and consultancies often meet clients who are eager to start an efficient energy management project and know the strengths and cost savings benefits it will bring. So why don’t you end up with the project? In most cases, it is because they do not have the funding to carry the project out. Certainly here you will think… “Well, if there is no money, there is nothing to do”. This is not so! If you want to overcome this barrier since the project is practically closed, why don’t you suggest an aid and subsidies for energy efficiency? As an energy manager, you must keep up to date with the different aids that exist in order to be able to support your clients. You will improve your relationship with them and give them extra value by providing them with this information. 2. How to analyze a huge amount of energy data
Analyzing an enormous amount of energy data is not easy, especially if you are still working with huge Excel sheets or old analysis tools. 20% of the professionals indicated the analysis of large amounts of data as their greatest challenge. This is completely normal among energy managers since the data coming from energy consumption are enormous. The problem comes when you get the data and you start asking yourself, what do I analyse or need to know?

Energy management steps STEP 3: Setting Goals
In the previous articles we discussed the first 2 steps to build energy management system in your organization and before that we clarified why you need to be a proactive energy manager. You can refer to the previous articles at the end of this article. In this article we will discuss the third step which is setting goals. STEP 3: Set Goals
Performance goals drive energy management activities and promote continuous improvement. Setting clear and measurable goals is critical for understanding intended results, developing effective strategies, and reaping financial gains. Well-stated goals guide daily decision-making and are the basis for tracking and measuring progress. Communicating and posting goals can motivate staff to support energy management efforts throughout the organization. The Energy Director in conjunction with the Energy Team typically develops goals and this will help him to:
- Set the tone for improvement throughout the organization
- Measure the success of the energy management program
- Help the Energy Team to identify progress and setbacks at a facility level
- Foster ownership of energy management, create a sense of purpose, and motivate staff
- Demonstrate commitment to reducing environmental impacts
- Create schedules for upgrade activities and identify milestones
To develop effective performance goals the below steps can be followed:
The target is to identify organizational and time parameters for goals. The scope of performance goals can include multiple levels of the organization as well as various time periods for completion of specific goals. - Organizational Level
The level at which performance goals will be set depends on the nature of the organization and how it uses energy. Common organizational levels for setting goals include:
Setting goals at this level provides a big picture of how the entire organization wants to improve. Organization-wide goals provide a framework for communicating the success of energy management both internal and external audiences. At this level, goals may vary to take into account the performance of specific facilities based on benchmarking results or an energy audit. Facility level goals are designed to help the broader organization to meet its goals. - Process or equipment
Some organizations may find it useful to establish goals for specific process lines and equipment when energy use is concentrated in specific areas. - Time Periods
Establishing appropriate and realistic target dates for goals ensures that they are meaningful and promote change. A combination of short and long term goals can be effective. - Short-term goals – Annual goals provide the necessary markers for tracking and reporting progress on a regular and on-going basis. - Long-term goals – Long-term goals are usually organization-specific and may be shaped by:
- – Internal rates of return
- – Internal planning horizons and guidelines
- – Organizational strategic plans
- – Commitments to voluntary environmental initiatives
2- Estimate potential for improvement
To set goals, it is important to have an informed idea of what level of performance is achievable and the amount of resources needed. There are a variety ways to determine potential. The method you choose will depend on a number of factors, such as: available resources, time, the nature of energy use at your facilities, and how the energy program is organized. Methods used by any leading energy programs shall include:
- Reviewing performance data
Assessing performance and setting baselines should help to identify differences in energy use between similar facilities, giving a limited, point-in-time, view of your potential improvement. Performance data spanning a longer period of time will be more useful for understanding improvement potential. Benchmarking provides a yard stick for evaluating opportunity when enough data is available to show trends in energy use. This can be done with the help of international entities that can compare the current Energy Performance Indicators (EPIs) of your facility against similar facilities. - Evaluating past projects and best practices
Evaluate past projects and best practices at higher-performing facilities to determine the feasibility of transferring these practices to other parts of the organization. - Reviewing technical assessments and audits
Identify opportunities to reduce energy use identified during technical assessments and audits of poorer performing facilities to serve as a strong basis for quantifying the potential for improvement. - Comparing goals of similar organizations
Reviewing performance goals of other organizations can help to guide and inform you of the potential for your own organization. - Linking to organization wide strategic goals
Strategic as well as operational goals, such as cost reductions, can also help inform the goal setting process. 3- Establish goals
The main target is to create and express clear, measurable goals, with target dates, for the entire organization, facilities, and other units. Once the potential for improvement has been estimated, goals can be established at the appropriate organizational levels.","[{'passage': 'We are thrilled to announce that our Director of Operations and Energy Engineer, Jason Clark, has met the rigorous testing and requirements to needed to qualify as a Certified Energy Manager.

Due to these factors, many facility executives are beginning to oversee more departments than they had in the past. Responsibilities may now include directing maintenance and facility staff as well as overseeing security, janitorial, or groundskeeping crews and duties. As facilities improve their engineering, architectural services, and IT and telecom systems, the facility professional’s responsibilities become more abundant and specialized. Energy purchasing has traditionally been, and continues to be, an important aspect of facility management. A focus on key performance indicators (KPIs) and budgeting for expenses both known and unknown are key components to a facility professional’s toolkit. According to National Grid, energy represents about 19% of total expenditures for a typical office building. With lighting, heating, and cooling consuming 54-71% of total energy use depending on climate, this raises the question: What steps are successful facility managers taking to control and reduce these costs? Here are five common mistakes facility professionals should avoid:\n1. Being an “energy manager” instead of a “facility manager:”\nYour time should be focused on your facility’s KPIs, so working with an energy partner that you can easily communicate your ideas and goals, along with one who understands your tolerance for risk, is key. Inevitably all energy contracts expire. It’s crucial to know how renewal will be handled as well as what the contract indicates will happen to your rate structure at the end of a given contract. Does the supply service default to a volatile variable rate in the middle of the summer or winter? Or, will you be back in the hands of the local utility service at the end of the term? Although not as prevalent, there is also a possibility that your contract will renew on a fixed rate and term. Using an energy partner allows you the advantage of having a dedicated advisor work on your behalf and will manage renewals to avoid high risk pricing scenarios. 2. Overlooking benchmarking energy and water usage:\nThe process of documenting and filing energy and water usage through the U.S. ENERGY STAR website should be the first step towards efficiency. Benchmarking provides a base number for energy usage and costs, while also comparing your property to similar properties in the area. Once you have baseline numbers you can begin to compare usage and cost year over year to determine whether or not the facility is following a sustainable plan, or if you should reevaluate your energy usage. 3. Settling for the “lowest price:”\nWe all know that pricing is an important factor when it comes to commodity procurement, but it shouldn’t be the most important factor. Oftentimes contract terms and supplier flexibility over the long-term will outweigh the short-term benefit of a low price. Bandwidth and usage restrictions (penalties for using more or less energy during a certain period of time) can be devastating during periods of severe weather, so make sure that bandwidth restrictions are structured and priced to fit your needs. Paying a bit more today might help avoid unwanted charges in the future. 4. Not addressing efficiency projects in order of importance:\nLighting and HVAC can eat up to 70 cents for every dollar spent on energy. If you are looking at co-generation systems and haven’t upgraded all of the lighting in your facility yet, or invested in the most efficient HVAC equipment, it might be time to pump the brakes. Work with your advisor to develop a plan that acts as a roadmap for projects and sets realistic goals in regards to efficiency and usage reductions. It makes no sense putting a Ferrari engine in a Volkswagen. Look at the largest most expensive projects only after other projects have been completed. 5. Ignoring the sun:\nSolar arrays (power systems designed to supply usable solar power) work to offset both electricity consumption and demand costs by producing electricity using solar panels that store captured energy in batteries. This option also reduces your carbon footprint because the electricity being produced doesn’t use fossil fuels. Solar energy can be a key component in a business becoming more sustainable. Understanding that the long-term savings are significant, it’s important to be aware that solar arrays do carry upfront costs, which will depend on the size of the system and specific application. Solar PV systems (solar power by means of photovoltaics) can cost up to $7 per installed watt.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:f4ecb5ee-6b5c-4621-aed3-bddd8353449f>']}, {'passage': 'In order to improve the sustainability of the planet, the area of Sustainability Jobs integrates social science, environmental science, and civil engineering. The demand for highly educated professionals to research and adopt more sustainable methods is greater than ever. In this post, we explain sustainability and give a rundown of degrees and employment available in the area. 1. An urbanist\nUrban planners’ main responsibilities are to help businesses and organisation create plans for the use of land. In the designs of an urban planner, communities, road networks, parks, and the general layout of a city might frequently be given priority. Urban planners also create policies or strategies to handle expanding populations while having the least possible negative environmental effects. 2. Landscape designer\nIn order to integrate man-made structures smoothly with the environment, landscape architects first conduct a survey of the area’s natural geology and topography. It is possible for landscape architects to work on creating animal habitats, distinctive locations, or long-lasting infrastructure systems in both urban and rural settings. 3. Environmental geologists\nResearching alternate sources of energy and resources is a crucial component of projects pertaining to Sustainability Jobs. An environmental geologist is crucial when advising mining and gas corporations on the acquisition and use of energy resources. 4. Environmental advisor\nAn environmental consultant often works on a contract basis with companies in the public or private sectors, such as water treatment plants, environmental agencies, and other businesses whose operations may have an impact on the environment. Environmental consultants can offer advice and planning solutions for issues including soil contamination, air quality, and water pollution. 5. Environmental scientist\nEnvironmental scientists search for the most effective ways to safeguard the environment and advance human health. Environmental scientists frequently conduct research into health and environmental issues, seek to pinpoint their root causes, and develop solutions for these issues in both the public and commercial sectors. An environmental scientist could investigate and examine enigmatic diseases, strange wildlife malformations, or sickness in a population with an unidentified source. Ecologists’ main responsibilities are to investigate and address how human behavior affects and influences the environment. An ecologist may work for environmental nonprofits, doing study and developing solutions to environmental issues brought on by human activity, consumption, and influence on the environment. Ecologists may even be a member of a research team that examines and investigates how community actions such as construction, restoration, and others affect ecosystems. 7. Air quality engineer\nAir quality engineers employ advanced monitoring procedures, chemical and statistical studies, and three-dimensional computer modelling to analyse the air pollution in a specific location. Air quality engineers occasionally develop or alter pollution-control machinery. In order to assess and study the effects of certain activities on the local surroundings, air quality engineers typically focus their efforts in or near big cities. 8. Engineering in the environment\nPrimary responsibilities: Environmental engineers provide solutions to environmental problems by combining environmental information with engineering concepts. Examples of environmental knowledge include soil composition and biological and ecological processes. Environmental engineers may work on initiatives or programmes to enhance public health, waste management and recycling, as well as initiatives to reduce or regulate air and water pollution. 9. Energy supervisor\nThe main responsibilities of energy managers are audits to guarantee effective use of resources, both financial and environmental. They could work for the government or the business sector. In the majority of cases, energy managers discover that the creation of new city projects, municipal plans, and governmental contracts requires their services. Energy managers may also be in charge of reducing the amount of energy and water used by creating projects that adhere to tight design guidelines, statutory requirements, and financial constraints. 10. Engineer in sustainability\nA sustainability engineer’s main responsibilities include developing strategies, evaluating locations, and studying financial data to create and implement renewable energy projects. Although Sustainability Jobs engineers often operate inside, they occasionally need to travel to certain job sites in order to effectively formulate task designs, comprehend necessary job specifications, and get more familiar with the project at hand. Many businesses provide Sustainability Jobs employment, which give the environment hope for a bright future. The prognosis for employment in sustainability will also continue to improve as the population continues to grow and businesses and organisation search for innovative methods to develop, manufacture, and utilise fuel resources in environmentally appropriate applications.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:53eea886-84c3-40a2-a0ba-7d6241685a5d>']}, {'passage': 'He has undertaken investigations in the region relating to the energy market, mining, oil & gas downstream and civil airports.

He is aware of the processes within many businesses, related to the technical infrastructure of buildings and other entities and the city streets technologies. He has a deep technical expertise, mainly in electrical equipment, and also in gas and water electrical machines. He intends to specialize in Energy Management relating to indoor entities: offices; hotels; shopping malls and also in the solar generation business. In order to implement the Energy Management process, I am going to apply the Standard ISO50001, which is based on the continual improvement cycle plan-do-check-act. The process will be incorporated in daily activities of the organization. The energies as water, air (compressed), oil & gas, electricity, heating & cooling, steam and their demand management require proper data gathering, processing and plan delivery. The existing theoretical frame and benchmark from global industry will show us what exactly data shall be gathered. I propose the research to be done from several perspectives – organizational, technical, chronological, etc. In case of good availability of data: as annual report, production data, organization chart, general policy, assets layout, utilities, procedures, facilities, significant energy users, contracts with energy, raw materials and services suppliers, I will do operational and technical predominantly quantitative analysis and propose monitoring system. If reliable information is missing, I will start with a usage of any available general information. Judgments on the performance can be done based on the information from the significant energy users, or facts as lamps switched-on in day time or water is running constantly in the toilet or air-conditioner is cycling. The hypothesis from those is that the organization lacks energy awareness and its influence on the cost. A collection of similar data, allows grouping and analysis. The analysis can be also qualitative, through surveys among employees or clients. If people say, that it is too hot and they open the windows frequently, the problem is obvious. The interviews can be done at random among the organization or sampling one department only. For analysis I will use regression and correlation approaches, mixing data from both, organizational and technical frames. For example if top Management declares full contribution to the execution of the Energy Management plan, the difference of water consumption in next quarter to be checked as a prove for such contribution. The Energy Management plan will be prepared as a result of gathering, processing and analysis of data and will provide outcomes – baseline, energy performance indicators, objectives, targets, short-term and long-term goals and action plans, for delivering improved energy usage results. Some improvement will be implemented immediately, others require investment decision. The energy usage and procurement policy will be described; the role of top management and energy team will be listed. Energy goals will be supported by metering, to be stipulated which ones. The improvement opportunities could be – new procedures, performance improvement, business process review, operations review, identification and elimination of waste, etc. I will set in the plan also a time frame and milestones, responsibilities and verification of the results and all will be documented. Ethical and security considerations will be done also, as some of the information, would be confidential or secret. The ultimate task of the plan is to make obvious the ways that energy is used, thus to increase cost awareness of the organization, followed by implementation of constant improvements of the energy demand and usage. There are plenty of technologies in any part of the business; the main barrier for change implementation in any organization are the employees or/and the management. I will propose measures to overcome barriers – resistance to change, lack of technical knowledge; potential savings are not recognizable, poor realization, lack of systematic approach. Those measures will lead to development of the people, improving their competence, basic technical knowledge and skills and energy demand awareness. If necessary, those training will be done under my personal guidance, as they are critical success factors. Another important task is the development of an energy use profile, to demonstrate how energy use is distributed among the company facilities, as well as identify the energy source for each system.

Identify and close new projects\nA 22% marked as their biggest challenge to be able to identify and close new projects. Although this is at the same time the priority of 46% of the professionals surveyed, it is not the main challenge for everyone. It is clear that the task of closing new projects is not an easy one. I’m going to put you in 3 different situations, which you may feel identified with:\nSituation 1: Difficulties in calculating return on investment (ROI). Imagine that you get a customer who needs to reduce their energy costs, and you plan to carry out an energy management project. The first thing the client will want to know is, how much is this going to cost me? Here, more than how much it is going to cost, you have to make them see it and clearly understand “how much it is going to benefit them”. So you will show them the ROI of the project. Here you can observe another of the challenges of the energy manager, which is how to calculate the ROI of your projects to show their viability to customers and/or financial managers. To give you a hand in this arduous task we provide you with a free downloadable template, which will help you to calculate the budget and ROI of your projects in a simple way. Situation 2: Lack of interest on the part of management. Now let’s put ourselves in a different situation. This time you have your whole plan presented. The person in charge of the management or the technician of the company is convinced that carrying out the project is a great idea, but … do the management think the same? Does the financier of the company see it that way and will give the approval to finance it? Here you will find another barrier to jump, convincing management and/or financiers. You must explain the benefits of an efficient energy management project for them. Show them the numbers, what the expenses and the ROI will be. This is the way they can see it clearly, the language of numbers. So, prepare yourself a good analysis and show the numbers, they love the numbers. For the best results, rely on adequate technology, such as an energy management solution that detects, analyses and controls energy data. Situation 3: Lack of funding\nEnergy managers and consultancies often meet clients who are eager to start an efficient energy management project and know the strengths and cost savings benefits it will bring. So why don’t you end up with the project? In most cases, it is because they do not have the funding to carry the project out. Certainly here you will think… “Well, if there is no money, there is nothing to do”. This is not so! If you want to overcome this barrier since the project is practically closed, why don’t you suggest an aid and subsidies for energy efficiency? As an energy manager, you must keep up to date with the different aids that exist in order to be able to support your clients. You will improve your relationship with them and give them extra value by providing them with this information. 2. How to analyze a huge amount of energy data\nAnalyzing an enormous amount of energy data is not easy, especially if you are still working with huge Excel sheets or old analysis tools. 20% of the professionals indicated the analysis of large amounts of data as their greatest challenge. This is completely normal among energy managers since the data coming from energy consumption are enormous. The problem comes when you get the data and you start asking yourself, what do I analyse or need to know?', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:c6897ba6-2a1e-4b87-8a0a-6dddf6dd8bc7>']}, {'passage': 'Energy management steps STEP 3: Setting Goals\nIn the previous articles we discussed the first 2 steps to build energy management system in your organization and before that we clarified why you need to be a proactive energy manager. You can refer to the previous articles at the end of this article. In this article we will discuss the third step which is setting goals. STEP 3: Set Goals\nPerformance goals drive energy management activities and promote continuous improvement. Setting clear and measurable goals is critical for understanding intended results, developing effective strategies, and reaping financial gains. Well-stated goals guide daily decision-making and are the basis for tracking and measuring progress. Communicating and posting goals can motivate staff to support energy management efforts throughout the organization. The Energy Director in conjunction with the Energy Team typically develops goals and this will help him to:\n- Set the tone for improvement throughout the organization\n- Measure the success of the energy management program\n- Help the Energy Team to identify progress and setbacks at a facility level\n- Foster ownership of energy management, create a sense of purpose, and motivate staff\n- Demonstrate commitment to reducing environmental impacts\n- Create schedules for upgrade activities and identify milestones\nTo develop effective performance goals the below steps can be followed:\nThe target is to identify organizational and time parameters for goals. The scope of performance goals can include multiple levels of the organization as well as various time periods for completion of specific goals. - Organizational Level\nThe level at which performance goals will be set depends on the nature of the organization and how it uses energy. Common organizational levels for setting goals include:\nSetting goals at this level provides a big picture of how the entire organization wants to improve. Organization-wide goals provide a framework for communicating the success of energy management both internal and external audiences. At this level, goals may vary to take into account the performance of specific facilities based on benchmarking results or an energy audit. Facility level goals are designed to help the broader organization to meet its goals. - Process or equipment\nSome organizations may find it useful to establish goals for specific process lines and equipment when energy use is concentrated in specific areas. - Time Periods\nEstablishing appropriate and realistic target dates for goals ensures that they are meaningful and promote change. A combination of short and long term goals can be effective. - Short-term goals – Annual goals provide the necessary markers for tracking and reporting progress on a regular and on-going basis. - Long-term goals – Long-term goals are usually organization-specific and may be shaped by:\n- – Internal rates of return\n- – Internal planning horizons and guidelines\n- – Organizational strategic plans\n- – Commitments to voluntary environmental initiatives\n2- Estimate potential for improvement\nTo set goals, it is important to have an informed idea of what level of performance is achievable and the amount of resources needed. There are a variety ways to determine potential. The method you choose will depend on a number of factors, such as: available resources, time, the nature of energy use at your facilities, and how the energy program is organized. Methods used by any leading energy programs shall include:\n- Reviewing performance data\nAssessing performance and setting baselines should help to identify differences in energy use between similar facilities, giving a limited, point-in-time, view of your potential improvement. Performance data spanning a longer period of time will be more useful for understanding improvement potential. Benchmarking provides a yard stick for evaluating opportunity when enough data is available to show trends in energy use. This can be done with the help of international entities that can compare the current Energy Performance Indicators (EPIs) of your facility against similar facilities. - Evaluating past projects and best practices\nEvaluate past projects and best practices at higher-performing facilities to determine the feasibility of transferring these practices to other parts of the organization. - Reviewing technical assessments and audits\nIdentify opportunities to reduce energy use identified during technical assessments and audits of poorer performing facilities to serve as a strong basis for quantifying the potential for improvement. - Comparing goals of similar organizations\nReviewing performance goals of other organizations can help to guide and inform you of the potential for your own organization. - Linking to organization wide strategic goals\nStrategic as well as operational goals, such as cost reductions, can also help inform the goal setting process. 3- Establish goals\nThe main target is to create and express clear, measurable goals, with target dates, for the entire organization, facilities, and other units. Once the potential for improvement has been estimated, goals can be established at the appropriate organizational levels.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:725b6584-71f6-46b7-9e34-1439f6d0f50c>']}]","{

                ""text"": ""02 Dec A Guide Customer Energy Manager (CEM)\nA building or home has its own energy consumption behaviour that is not only unique to the inhabitant habits, but also dependent on the devices or equipment within. For energy management systems, that aim to optimise the energy usage of a building or home, this variable pattern of usage is one of the many factors that it needs to consider for functioning properly. This is where Customer Energy Manager, or simply CEM, comes in. CEM is the key component that lends flexibility to the whole energy management system. It consists of a logical function that compiles together the customer\u2019s preferred configuration, the devices in the building or home, the grid, and any other additional settings. It then makes the decision of how to optimise energy generation or consumption based on these inputs. To elaborate, the CEM gathers information about all the energy outlets on their energy needs for a certain period of time. The energy outlets could be household appliances such as refrigerators, lighting, heat pumps and water heaters or office equipment such as printing machines, HVAC, and security functions. However, apart from the energy consumers, it also consults the energy producers or sources such as photovoltaic systems, energy storage systems or electric vehicle charging stations. By comparing and understanding the energy profiles of these energy outlets and sources, the CEM can then be optimised using the information on expected available energy and price offers for the stipulated time period. This is done by creating graphs of energy vs time that lines up slots next to each other. Each slot defines the amount of energy required during the period. The CEM is then not only looking to distribute energy in a non-interruptive way but also optimising the expenses that the energy usage will incur. As the CEM not only has the information about the internal environment and preferences of the customers but also has signals from the grid that it is connected to which provides information about the varying energy pricing. Considering the time of the day, energy generation, energy requirements, energy rates, and many other factors, the CEM utilises its logic function that will efficiently allocate the energy in a non-interruptive fashion with an aim to bring down the dependency on external sources as much as possible, thus lowering the energy expenses. Moreover, since the CEM can also recognize the load on the smart power grid with its peak and low times, it will make sure that the entire network is also not overburdened. Thus, a CEM is also a key player in improving the overall efficiency and stability of the entire grid. As the CEM collects information on all the energy outlets, sources, and generators within a building or home, it is best suited to play a key role in load management, as a central decision-maker or suggestion-provider for load adaptions. It can take up the task of evaluating tariff-based management and generation management. The CEM sits at the intersection of the internal environment of infrastructure and its external environment by being connected to the energy grid. This allows it to play a pivotal role in Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) and Building Energy Management Systems (BEMS) to provide the optimal energy performance."",

On December 24, 1894 at Gutian she wrote : “One more Christmas nearly gone – one year nearer to heaven.”
On August 1, 1895 she, the Saunders sisters and the Stewarts with some of their children were among eleven foreigners massacred by members of the Vegetarian sect7 at Huashan. In one of the last letters she wrote before her death Miss Cooke sadly commented that the Singapore girls were closely connected with those who had been murdered. But for Chitnio, Wee Inn and the others in Fujian it was business as usual. Chitnio was assisting with training biblewomen and accompanying foreign missionary women on their visits to villages. Miss Bushell visited Wee Inn (wife of the Rev Yek Sui Mi) in Fuqing (Hok Chiang) in 1897 and found her as busy as ever. Wee Inn had three sons and one daughter and Miss Bushell commented: “Her family is quite a model of good behaviour, brought up carefully and nicely. She is certainly a most earnest and good woman – her light shines brightly.”

East Asia: China
A HUMAN PERSPECTIVE In ancient times, China had been open to attack from nomadic horsemen who roamed the plains of northern China and Mongolia. Around 220 B.C., the emperor Shi Huangdi decided to build the Great Wall of China by closing the gaps between smaller walls built by earlier rulers. Hundreds of thousands of peasants were used as forced labor to build the Great Wall. The workers hauled and dumped millions of tons of rubble to fill the core of the wall. From the Yellow Sea in the east to the Gobi desert in the west, the Great Wall twisted and turned for thousands of miles, protecting and isolating China from the barbarian warriors beyond its borders. China's Early History
China is the world's oldest continuous civilization. The beginnings of that civilization extend back into the mists of prehistory. Because of China's geography—the long distances that separated it from Europe and other continents—it followed its own direction. EARLY CIVILIZATION AND THE DYNASTIES
China has been a settled society for more than 4,000 years. In its earliest days, China was made up of a number of Stone Age cultures. Then it was ruled by dynasties. A dynasty is a series of rulers from the same family. The first Chinese dynasty was the Shang. This dynasty arose during the 1700s B.C. It ruled a central area in China for about 600 years until it was overthrown by the Zhou Dynasty, which ruled part of northern China. The next important dynasty, the Qin (chihn), gave its name to China. In 221 B.C., the Qin Dynasty united a number of smaller states under a strong central government and established an empire. The first Qin emperor was Shi Huangdi, the builder of the Great Wall. The Chinese empire, ruled by different dynasties, lasted for more than 2,000 years. Another important Chinese dynasty was that of the Han. These rulers pushed the empire into central Asia, home to many nomadic tribes. Many other dynasties followed over the centuries. In 1644, the Manchu people of Manchuria invaded China and established the Qing (chihng) Dynasty. In 1911, the Manchus were overthrown by revolutionaries, and this ended the dynasties and the Chinese empire. China Opens Up to the World
Even though China remained isolated from other regions for centuries, that started to change in the 13th century. At that time, European travelers began to visit China. Marco Polo, for example, traveled from Venice, Italy, to China in the 13th century and wrote a book about his adventures, The Travels of Marco Polo. China and Europe had few contacts until the 19th century, when European powers sought access to Chinese markets. At that point, China had a weak military and an ineffective government. Europeans took advantage of China and forced it to sign a series of treaties that granted special privileges to the Europeans. Consequently, China was carved up into spheres of influence controlled by Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and Japan. This outside control angered China, which burst forth in the Boxer Rebellion of 1900. Chinese militants attacked and killed Europeans and Chinese Christians in China. A multinational force of about 20,000 soldiers finally defeated the Boxers. REVOLUTION AND CHANGE
After the Boxer Rebellion, the Qing Dynasty, founded by the Manchus, attempted to reform the Chinese government, but it was too late. Many individuals and groups wanted to form a republic, which would give the people a voice in their government. In 1912, Sun Yat-sen and others founded the Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party. However, the republic, led by Sun Yat-sen, was undermined by civil war throughout China. When Sun Yat-sen died in 1925, a general named Chiang Kai-shek took over the Nationalist Party. Chiang's troops fought against the warlords of China and united most of the country in the 1920s. However, throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the Chinese Communist Party became an increasingly powerful force in China. The Nationalists and the Communists fought for control of China. In 1949, the Communists, under the leadership of Mao Zedong, finally defeated the Nationalists.

Q: How did you first develop an interest in Chinese languages, history, and culture? A: Serendipity at age 14. At a Magnet High School in Minneapolis, merely by chance I took Chinese language from Margaret Wong, a pedagogic genius who convinced many of us that learning Chinese was urgently necessary, and easy. Teacher Wong's father had fought on the losing side of China's civil war in the 1940s, as a high-ranking Nationalist general close to Chiang Kai-shek. Her war stories from the 1940s mesmerized me, as did her anecdotes about growing up in a powerful household of wartime China, cosmopolitan Shanghai, and political Beijing. Despite Teacher Wong's Nationalist background, she developed strong ties with the new PRC, and thus our Chinese class managed to visit China in 1978, as guests of the Chinese government, six months before the US and China normalized relations in 1979. The only photo I have from that trip is following a basketball game we played with a school team in a mountain village. Our overnight in the mountains was unplanned; that day the military needed our hotel due to the eruption of tensions on the Sino-Soviet border. Following this 1978 trip, I stayed on in Hong Kong, studying language and history at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. My subsequent education at Stanford and Harvard was driven by an obsession with China and learning Chinese. I've been lucky, studying with some of the leading China scholars in the world, and studying intensive Chinese at the preeminent language centers in China and Taiwan. I've also enjoyed non-academic experiences in East Asia, such as acting in movies, helping produce the first Chinese-Japanese TV series, living in a village, on a farmer's roof next to his pigeon coop, and working as a runway model. Q: How long would it take to traverse the entire 3,600 miles of the Yangtze? What would one see of note upstream of the Three Gorges? A: Well, it could take months, as it did for the several million people who walked up the Yangtze from Shanghai to Chongqing, to escape the fighting during World War II. Regarding the historical significance of the Three Gorges and the Yangtze River, bear in mind that China's history, unlike Western history, occurred in a concentrated geographic area. The history of the west is spread out across half the globe, from Mesopotamia, the Mideast, the Mediterranean, Europe, and then North America. By contrast, China's historical experience occurred largely within the area of today's China. This means that China's equivalent of Abraham, Odysseus, Hippocrates, Cleopatra, Caesar, da Vinci, Shakespeare, Isaac Newton, Napoleon, George Washington, and Teddy Roosevelt all lived within a relatively restricted geographical space, especially along China's great river systems. (This is also why the remarkable Terra Cotta warriors of the First Emperor were discovered by chance, by farmers digging a well). The earth is brimming with archeological riches and places such as the Three Gorges are bursting with historical memory and cultural significance. And the lessons of this area continue to excite the modern imagination. Take for example the classic novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguo yanyi), which describes in Homeric detail the adventures inside the Three Gorges of warriors such as Guan Gong (China's Achilles) and the ingenious military strategist Zhu Geliang. This exciting text informed the strategic thinking of Chairman Mao Zedong more than the writings of Marx and Lenin. The blockbuster film ""Red Cliff"" reinterpreted these dramas for the big screen. Recent archeological discoveries of the 'Sanxingdui' culture now posit a competing vision of early Chinese civilization, complicating the Yellow River's age-old claim as the China's ""cradle."" The role of the Three Gorges in Tang poetry, Song painting, and Ming drama is profound. The Three Gorges are also visually stunning, as are the unspoiled nature reserves in adjacent tributaries feeding the Three Gorges. Finally, to come to terms with contemporary China, one must understand the Three Gorges Dam. Q: When Smithsonian travelers tour a traditional, perhaps millennium old, Beijing ""hutong"" or neighborhood, what should they be especially aware of? Architecture? Layout? Location relative to the Forbidden City?

Two people that I met in China died recently. Last week it was Huang Hua, once Vice Prime Minister of China, who entertained my father and the members of his family traveling with him in a dining hall in the Forbidden City in Beijing. More on that later. The other was Joan Hinton, whom I met on a collective farm in rural China. My father led a group of American agriculturalists around China for 30 days in 1984. Instead of just visiting the cities, we spent much of our time in the country so that the agricultural scientists could talk with the people running the large farming operations. Joan Hinton and her husband were on a farm that had a large dairy operation that Hinton’s husband, Erwin Engst, had helped build. The couple had raised their children in China and Mrs. Hinton told me that her son, who had returned to the United States for college, had an accent that for some reason was mistaken as German, not Chinese. The Hintons wore Mao jackets, which was curious since this was twelve years after Nixon’s visit and eight years after Mao’s death. Most government officials by then were wearing well-tailored Italian suits. My father said that Engst and others had built a very good dairy operation from scratch, and he was impressed. He did not know anything about Hinton and it was only after her obituary appeared in the New York Times in June of this year that I learned of her connection to the Manhattan project and the suspicion that she may have been a spy. The couple struck me as good natured old lefties of the sort that one could still find in the coffee shops along Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley in the 60s talking about visiting Trotsky in Mexico before his assassination by Stalin's agents. Huang Hua was a very different story and to tell what I know about him requires that I explain why my father was in China in the first place, By the time I went with him in 1984 my father and mother had been to China five times. They had first gone in 1972. When Nixon returned from China my father got a call from Earl Butz, then Secretary of Agriculture, whom my father had known for more than a decade. As my father told it, Butz’s first words were, “You’re going to China.” My father had no connection with China and asked why. “They asked for you,” was Butz’s reply. “But why me?” my father asked. “I don’t know.” In time my father did find out. In the 1950s, he had written up some research he found in a journal published in Hong Kong. The paper had been roughly translated into English and my father saw the results as significant. He wrote about this in several places, but never knew that it had come out of Red China. He told me he had assumed it had been done in Taiwan or Hong Kong. My father’s attention gave the paper international recognition at a time when Chinese research was often ignored by western scientific publications. The Chinese never forgot and when Butz asked if they had a preference about who could lead the first exchange of livestock producers, they asked for my father. So in late 1972 my father went to China. He met several officials and spoke at the University of Beijing, but he spent most of his time talking to the leaders of collective farms. Because he went to parts of China where no American had been for a generation, his return flight was routed through Washington where he was debriefed by someone from the Pentagon. According to my father, he made a lousy spy because, in his words, ""I couldn't tell a missile silo from a grain silo."" (Actually I'm quite sure he could, but it was probably his way of saying that the debriefing made him uncomfortable. He thought that agriculture should be outside of politics, if not above it.) My father kept going back. Several times he asked me to come with him, but the time required either conflicted with school (I was in law school until 1974) or work. Finally I went in 1984. The dinner in the dining hall in the Forbidden City with Huang Hua and his wife was perhaps the most unique event I have ever attended. My father had been dealing with the Vice Prime Minister for years and the two had become friends, but the rest of us were in awe of the man who had met with Henry Kissinger to bring down the barriers that had separated China from the United States since 1949.

In India, Alexander smashed a local Indian army and marveled at its elephants. But even as Alexander continued lusting after new discoveries in the East, his men began to rebel. Alexander dreamed of continuing on to China; his men dreamed of going home to Greece. Finally, Alexander gave in, though a report said he retreated to his tent and broke down in sobs of fury and disappointment. Instead of returning as he had come, he marched south to the coast of the Indian Ocean, where he divided his army into three parts. One was to return by ship, while the other two would march overland. The middle route, which Alexander personally led, was across the barren, lifeless stretch of land called the Makran Desert—an area avoided by travelers to this day. Alexander’s men were decimated by the burning sun and parched landscape, but Alexander survived. When he returned to Babylon, Alexander had been in the East for seven years and had conquered most of the known world. But instead of resting, Alexander ordered a fleet to prepare to sail around the Persian coast. Alexander’s dream was never realized. At age 33, he died of disease. Who were the early Chinese explorers? While the empires of the western world were expanding eastward, explorers from the Chinese Empire were venturing west. The first motive of the Chinese was to establish
But a second motive emerged after A.D. 400—religion. Buddhism emerged in India in the sixth century B.c. and spread to China. Later, Chinese pilgrims would travel to India to discover more about the Buddha and his teachings. Who was Chang Ch’ien the Chinese explorer? Chang Ch’ien was one of the earliest and most famous Chinese explorers. In 138 B.C., the Emperor Wu Ti sent Ch’ien west on a mission to find allies. But he was captured by China’s enemy, the Huns, and spent ten years in captivity. He escaped and made contact with the Yiieh-chih, a nomadic tribe in what is today Afghanistan. Ch’ien reported back to the Chinese emperor in 116,B.c. Wu Ti sent him on another mission the following year, this time to the Wu-Sun, a tribe that lived in what is today southern Russia. On this journey, Ch’ien compiled information on Fergana, a city in Uzbekistan, and India and Parthia—modem-day Iran. When Ch’ien’s journeys were complete, China had made contact with the civilization established by Alexander the Great. The Roman and Chinese empires began to exchange goods. What was the Silk Road? The Silk Road was a 4,000-mile-long trading route between the civilizations of Rome and China. Caravans carrying Chinese goods—especially silk—traveled out of northwest China, around the burning desert sands of Takla Makan, over the Pamir Mountains north of India, into Mesopotamia, and finally arrived at the eastern end of the Mediterranean. No one group made the trip. Instead, the goods were passed from one group to another, often taking years to reach their destination. The groups inhabiting the middle of the Silk Road made enormous profits from the trade, and they tried to prevent any direct contact between China and the Roman Empire. Who was Fa-hsien the Chinese Buddhist traveller? Fa-hsien was born in the Chinese city of Shansi sometime in the fourth century A.D. As a young man, Fa-hsien became an avid follower of Buddha. He resolved to visit India to see where the Buddha had lived his life and visit temples and shrines of Buddhist teaching. According to an account written by Fa-hsien titled Fo Kua Chi (Record of Buddhist Kingdoms), it took him more than five years to journey from China to central India. “In the desert were numerous evil spirits and scorching winds, causing death to anyone who would meet them,” he wrote. “Above there were no birds, while on the ground there were no animals. One looked as far as one could in all directions for a path to cross, but there was none to choose. Only the dried bones of the dead served as indications.” Fa-hsien wrote of mountains where he climbed sheer cliffs 8,000 feet tall.

Thus, by the mid-1980s, even foreigners with a limited knowledge of Chinese could, with the help of colleagues and translators, find out about China's long twentieth-century history of oral history, in much of its diversity and complexity. It seems, though, that this knowledge never entered a broader academic, let alone public, memory. This seeming reluctance to engage with pre-1980s oral history is even more perplexing when considering the article Zuo published in 2015. According to Zuo's article, which is based on Chinese publications and does not reference any English-language articles, oral history existed in China before the 1980s, but not in its ""modern form."" Zuo writes: ""Modern oral history started in 1948 at Columbia University's Oral History Research Office.… Oral history in China was introduced from the West during the 1980s. Thus, the rise of oral history is a new trend in the development of historical studies in China. ""55 This is also the explanation Zheng Songhui, who described the development of oral history at Chinese libraries in 2008, provided.56 Li Huibo from China Women's University differentiates a first phase of oral history defined by state ideology from a ""second phase, the period beginning in the 1980s, when oral history was 'geared to international standards. '""57 Her British collaborator on a women's oral history project, Margaretta Jolly, explained: ""Notably, these [standards] reflect not so much a movement away from the explicitly political approach of the earlier era as a complex mix of European Marxist and feminist [End Page 12] ideas of 'history from below,' which was partly disseminated through a visit by socialist British oral historian Paul Thompson in 1986. ""58 This is also what the CCOH staff told me. Considering Stave's and Kwong's articles, I found this assertion that oral history in China began only in the 1980s startling. Zuo argued that current Chinese oral history began only in the mid-1980s, even though oral historians, as he acknowledged, were aware of and informed by earlier research: ""Because of the long tradition of oral history in China and the practice of oral historical research as well as the oral interviews since 1949, Chinese scholars did not feel unfamiliar with the Western concept of oral history when it was introduced into China in the 1980s. The Western theory and method of oral history were smoothly accepted and quickly modified to integrate into the Chinese practice of the oral historical interview.… In 1986, Jing Shun published the first academic article to introduce to Chinese readers the theory and methods of oral history used in Europe and the United States. ""59 But Zuo did not explain what differentiated Chinese and Western oral history practices or what made the latter ""modern."" Zuo argued that since the 1980s, oral history in China has developed along ""two basic tracks."" One included historians using oral history in order to find out about the past; the other included a smaller group of oral historians exploring the theoretical underpinnings of oral history. ""Through the combined efforts of these two groups of scholars,"" he notes, ""oral history quickly took off as a new branch of the discipline of history in China. ""60 In Beijing, I met a few oral historians who had been conducting interviews since the 1980s. Ding Yizhuang, for example, interviewed Manchu women and old Beijingers in the 1990s and published several volumes of their narratives.61 Chen Mo has been interviewing Chinese filmmakers. Both later published books on oral history theory and method. Throughout the Oral History in China Conference they, like others, did not refer to any of the earlier work. Instead, they seemed to agree that oral history in China had begun only in the 1980s and that China now needed to catch up to the standards the West developed. Only Chu Hong-yuan from Taiwan called upon his colleagues not to focus exclusively on Western models but also to remember their own history—without referencing, however, any specific studies, projects, or scholars.

So far
no U.S. account of the meeting has surfaced but Ambassador Hilaly
debriefed Harold Saunders on the discussions several weeks later. Hilaly's account of the meeting showed Nixon asking President
Yahya to ""convey his feelings to the Chinese at the highest
level"" that he believed that 1) ""Asia can not move forward
if a nation as large as China remains isolated,"" and 2) the
United States would not be ""party to any arrangements designed
to isolate China."" With this conversation, Nixon had taken
the first step toward opening a secret channel through Pakistan
that would later prove decisive. 3: Xiong Xianghui, ""The Prelude to the Opening of Sino-American
Relations,"" Zhonggong dangshi ziliao [CCP History
Materials] No. 42 (June 1992), excerpts
In the early 1990s, Xiong Xianghui published the first historical
account, along with documents, of a special study group tasked
by Chairman Mao in 1969 to review China's strategic policy. Xiong,
formerly an aide to Zhou Enlai, had been the secretary to this
group, which consisted of four marshals, senior military figures
who had been sent to inspect factories during the Cultural Revolution. The four marshals first focused on relations with Moscow just
as the Sino-Soviet border clashes were breaking out; although
they saw the Soviets as dangerous, they doubted that Moscow intended
to launch war against China. After Lin Biao gave a speech harshly
attacking U.S. and Soviet imperialism, Mao asked the marshals
to think outside the box about U.S. and Soviet policy. The four
marshals initially doubted that the Soviets and the Americans
would act against China either separately or jointly. When the
border fighting intensified in August 1969, marshals Chen Yi and
Ye Jianying worried about a confrontation with Moscow and proposed
playing the ""card of the United States."" In a separate
report, Chen proposed high-level talks with the U.S. in order
to solve basic problems in the relationship. The fourth line of
the third page reproduced here includes the text about playing
the American card. (Note 1)

In another attempt to signal to the U.S. government but also
a domestic audience about the need for a new relationship with
the United States, on 1 October 1970 (National Day), Mao had journalist
Edgar Snow stand by him at the Gate of Heavenly Peace during the
parade. Several months later, Snow met with Mao for five hours
of talks on 18 December 1970 during which the Chairman said the
[T]he foreign ministry was studying the matter of admitting
Americans from the left, middle, and right to visit China. Should
rightists like Nixon, who represented the monopoly capitalists,
be permitted to come? He should be welcomed because, Mao explained
at present the problems between China and the US would have
to be solved with Nixon. Mao would be happy to talk with him,
either as a tourist or as President. A week later, perhaps to reaffirm that something was afoot with
Sino-American relations, People's Daily published a picture
of Mao and Snow from the National Day event. While the China expert
Allen Whiting proposed going to Switzerland to debrief Snow about
his trip to China and meetings with the leadership, John Holdridge,
the China expert on Kissinger's staff, advised against that on
the grounds that Snow was a leftist. Had the debriefing gone ahead,
Nixon could have learned that Mao had invited him to China, months
before Snow made it public in Life magazine at the end
of April 1971. (Note 2)

Around 220 B.C., the emperor Shi Huangdi decided to build the Great Wall of China by closing the gaps between smaller walls built by earlier rulers. Hundreds of thousands of peasants were used as forced labor to build the Great Wall. The workers hauled and dumped millions of tons of rubble to fill the core of the wall. From the Yellow Sea in the east to the Gobi desert in the west, the Great Wall twisted and turned for thousands of miles, protecting and isolating China from the barbarian warriors beyond its borders. China's Early History\nChina is the world's oldest continuous civilization. The beginnings of that civilization extend back into the mists of prehistory. Because of China's geography—the long distances that separated it from Europe and other continents—it followed its own direction. EARLY CIVILIZATION AND THE DYNASTIES\nChina has been a settled society for more than 4,000 years. In its earliest days, China was made up of a number of Stone Age cultures. Then it was ruled by dynasties. A dynasty is a series of rulers from the same family. The first Chinese dynasty was the Shang. This dynasty arose during the 1700s B.C. It ruled a central area in China for about 600 years until it was overthrown by the Zhou Dynasty, which ruled part of northern China. The next important dynasty, the Qin (chihn), gave its name to China. In 221 B.C., the Qin Dynasty united a number of smaller states under a strong central government and established an empire. The first Qin emperor was Shi Huangdi, the builder of the Great Wall. The Chinese empire, ruled by different dynasties, lasted for more than 2,000 years. Another important Chinese dynasty was that of the Han. These rulers pushed the empire into central Asia, home to many nomadic tribes. Many other dynasties followed over the centuries. In 1644, the Manchu people of Manchuria invaded China and established the Qing (chihng) Dynasty. In 1911, the Manchus were overthrown by revolutionaries, and this ended the dynasties and the Chinese empire. China Opens Up to the World\nEven though China remained isolated from other regions for centuries, that started to change in the 13th century. At that time, European travelers began to visit China. Marco Polo, for example, traveled from Venice, Italy, to China in the 13th century and wrote a book about his adventures, The Travels of Marco Polo. China and Europe had few contacts until the 19th century, when European powers sought access to Chinese markets. At that point, China had a weak military and an ineffective government. Europeans took advantage of China and forced it to sign a series of treaties that granted special privileges to the Europeans. Consequently, China was carved up into spheres of influence controlled by Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and Japan. This outside control angered China, which burst forth in the Boxer Rebellion of 1900. Chinese militants attacked and killed Europeans and Chinese Christians in China. A multinational force of about 20,000 soldiers finally defeated the Boxers. REVOLUTION AND CHANGE\nAfter the Boxer Rebellion, the Qing Dynasty, founded by the Manchus, attempted to reform the Chinese government, but it was too late. Many individuals and groups wanted to form a republic, which would give the people a voice in their government. In 1912, Sun Yat-sen and others founded the Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party. However, the republic, led by Sun Yat-sen, was undermined by civil war throughout China. When Sun Yat-sen died in 1925, a general named Chiang Kai-shek took over the Nationalist Party. Chiang's troops fought against the warlords of China and united most of the country in the 1920s. However, throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the Chinese Communist Party became an increasingly powerful force in China. The Nationalists and the Communists fought for control of China. In 1949, the Communists, under the leadership of Mao Zedong, finally defeated the Nationalists."", 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:66cb3526-7f58-4c0f-a904-c7c1bcb5cd8f>']}, {'passage': 'Q: How did you first develop an interest in Chinese languages, history, and culture? A: Serendipity at age 14. At a Magnet High School in Minneapolis, merely by chance I took Chinese language from Margaret Wong, a pedagogic genius who convinced many of us that learning Chinese was urgently necessary, and easy. Teacher Wong\'s father had fought on the losing side of China\'s civil war in the 1940s, as a high-ranking Nationalist general close to Chiang Kai-shek. Her war stories from the 1940s mesmerized me, as did her anecdotes about growing up in a powerful household of wartime China, cosmopolitan Shanghai, and political Beijing. Despite Teacher Wong\'s Nationalist background, she developed strong ties with the new PRC, and thus our Chinese class managed to visit China in 1978, as guests of the Chinese government, six months before the US and China normalized relations in 1979. The only photo I have from that trip is following a basketball game we played with a school team in a mountain village. Our overnight in the mountains was unplanned; that day the military needed our hotel due to the eruption of tensions on the Sino-Soviet border. Following this 1978 trip, I stayed on in Hong Kong, studying language and history at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. My subsequent education at Stanford and Harvard was driven by an obsession with China and learning Chinese. I\'ve been lucky, studying with some of the leading China scholars in the world, and studying intensive Chinese at the preeminent language centers in China and Taiwan. I\'ve also enjoyed non-academic experiences in East Asia, such as acting in movies, helping produce the first Chinese-Japanese TV series, living in a village, on a farmer\'s roof next to his pigeon coop, and working as a runway model. Q: How long would it take to traverse the entire 3,600 miles of the Yangtze? What would one see of note upstream of the Three Gorges? A: Well, it could take months, as it did for the several million people who walked up the Yangtze from Shanghai to Chongqing, to escape the fighting during World War II. Regarding the historical significance of the Three Gorges and the Yangtze River, bear in mind that China\'s history, unlike Western history, occurred in a concentrated geographic area. The history of the west is spread out across half the globe, from Mesopotamia, the Mideast, the Mediterranean, Europe, and then North America. By contrast, China\'s historical experience occurred largely within the area of today\'s China. This means that China\'s equivalent of Abraham, Odysseus, Hippocrates, Cleopatra, Caesar, da Vinci, Shakespeare, Isaac Newton, Napoleon, George Washington, and Teddy Roosevelt all lived within a relatively restricted geographical space, especially along China\'s great river systems. (This is also why the remarkable Terra Cotta warriors of the First Emperor were discovered by chance, by farmers digging a well). The earth is brimming with archeological riches and places such as the Three Gorges are bursting with historical memory and cultural significance. And the lessons of this area continue to excite the modern imagination. Take for example the classic novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguo yanyi), which describes in Homeric detail the adventures inside the Three Gorges of warriors such as Guan Gong (China\'s Achilles) and the ingenious military strategist Zhu Geliang. This exciting text informed the strategic thinking of Chairman Mao Zedong more than the writings of Marx and Lenin. The blockbuster film ""Red Cliff"" reinterpreted these dramas for the big screen. Recent archeological discoveries of the \'Sanxingdui\' culture now posit a competing vision of early Chinese civilization, complicating the Yellow River\'s age-old claim as the China\'s ""cradle."" The role of the Three Gorges in Tang poetry, Song painting, and Ming drama is profound. The Three Gorges are also visually stunning, as are the unspoiled nature reserves in adjacent tributaries feeding the Three Gorges. Finally, to come to terms with contemporary China, one must understand the Three Gorges Dam.

Last week it was Huang Hua, once Vice Prime Minister of China, who entertained my father and the members of his family traveling with him in a dining hall in the Forbidden City in Beijing. More on that later. The other was Joan Hinton, whom I met on a collective farm in rural China. My father led a group of American agriculturalists around China for 30 days in 1984. Instead of just visiting the cities, we spent much of our time in the country so that the agricultural scientists could talk with the people running the large farming operations. Joan Hinton and her husband were on a farm that had a large dairy operation that Hinton’s husband, Erwin Engst, had helped build. The couple had raised their children in China and Mrs. Hinton told me that her son, who had returned to the United States for college, had an accent that for some reason was mistaken as German, not Chinese. The Hintons wore Mao jackets, which was curious since this was twelve years after Nixon’s visit and eight years after Mao’s death. Most government officials by then were wearing well-tailored Italian suits. My father said that Engst and others had built a very good dairy operation from scratch, and he was impressed. He did not know anything about Hinton and it was only after her obituary appeared in the New York Times in June of this year that I learned of her connection to the Manhattan project and the suspicion that she may have been a spy. The couple struck me as good natured old lefties of the sort that one could still find in the coffee shops along Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley in the 60s talking about visiting Trotsky in Mexico before his assassination by Stalin\'s agents. Huang Hua was a very different story and to tell what I know about him requires that I explain why my father was in China in the first place, By the time I went with him in 1984 my father and mother had been to China five times. They had first gone in 1972. When Nixon returned from China my father got a call from Earl Butz, then Secretary of Agriculture, whom my father had known for more than a decade. As my father told it, Butz’s first words were, “You’re going to China.” My father had no connection with China and asked why. “They asked for you,” was Butz’s reply. “But why me?” my father asked. “I don’t know.” In time my father did find out. In the 1950s, he had written up some research he found in a journal published in Hong Kong. The paper had been roughly translated into English and my father saw the results as significant. He wrote about this in several places, but never knew that it had come out of Red China. He told me he had assumed it had been done in Taiwan or Hong Kong. My father’s attention gave the paper international recognition at a time when Chinese research was often ignored by western scientific publications. The Chinese never forgot and when Butz asked if they had a preference about who could lead the first exchange of livestock producers, they asked for my father. So in late 1972 my father went to China. He met several officials and spoke at the University of Beijing, but he spent most of his time talking to the leaders of collective farms. Because he went to parts of China where no American had been for a generation, his return flight was routed through Washington where he was debriefed by someone from the Pentagon. According to my father, he made a lousy spy because, in his words, ""I couldn\'t tell a missile silo from a grain silo."" (Actually I\'m quite sure he could, but it was probably his way of saying that the debriefing made him uncomfortable. He thought that agriculture should be outside of politics, if not above it.) My father kept going back. Several times he asked me to come with him, but the time required either conflicted with school (I was in law school until 1974) or work. Finally I went in 1984. The dinner in the dining hall in the Forbidden City with Huang Hua and his wife was perhaps the most unique event I have ever attended. My father had been dealing with the Vice Prime Minister for years and the two had become friends, but the rest of us were in awe of the man who had met with Henry Kissinger to bring down the barriers that had separated China from the United States since 1949.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:0cf1f3cb-a0bb-477b-b15c-2f956a015ec7>']}, {'passage': 'In India, Alexander smashed a local Indian army and marveled at its elephants. But even as Alexander continued lusting after new discoveries in the East, his men began to rebel. Alexander dreamed of continuing on to China; his men dreamed of going home to Greece. Finally, Alexander gave in, though a report said he retreated to his tent and broke down in sobs of fury and disappointment. Instead of returning as he had come, he marched south to the coast of the Indian Ocean, where he divided his army into three parts. One was to return by ship, while the other two would march overland. The middle route, which Alexander personally led, was across the barren, lifeless stretch of land called the Makran Desert—an area avoided by travelers to this day. Alexander’s men were decimated by the burning sun and parched landscape, but Alexander survived. When he returned to Babylon, Alexander had been in the East for seven years and had conquered most of the known world. But instead of resting, Alexander ordered a fleet to prepare to sail around the Persian coast. Alexander’s dream was never realized. At age 33, he died of disease. Who were the early Chinese explorers? While the empires of the western world were expanding eastward, explorers from the Chinese Empire were venturing west. The first motive of the Chinese was to establish\nBut a second motive emerged after A.D. 400—religion. Buddhism emerged in India in the sixth century B.c. and spread to China. Later, Chinese pilgrims would travel to India to discover more about the Buddha and his teachings. Who was Chang Ch’ien the Chinese explorer? Chang Ch’ien was one of the earliest and most famous Chinese explorers. In 138 B.C., the Emperor Wu Ti sent Ch’ien west on a mission to find allies. But he was captured by China’s enemy, the Huns, and spent ten years in captivity. He escaped and made contact with the Yiieh-chih, a nomadic tribe in what is today Afghanistan. Ch’ien reported back to the Chinese emperor in 116,B.c. Wu Ti sent him on another mission the following year, this time to the Wu-Sun, a tribe that lived in what is today southern Russia. On this journey, Ch’ien compiled information on Fergana, a city in Uzbekistan, and India and Parthia—modem-day Iran. When Ch’ien’s journeys were complete, China had made contact with the civilization established by Alexander the Great. The Roman and Chinese empires began to exchange goods. What was the Silk Road? The Silk Road was a 4,000-mile-long trading route between the civilizations of Rome and China. Caravans carrying Chinese goods—especially silk—traveled out of northwest China, around the burning desert sands of Takla Makan, over the Pamir Mountains north of India, into Mesopotamia, and finally arrived at the eastern end of the Mediterranean. No one group made the trip. Instead, the goods were passed from one group to another, often taking years to reach their destination. The groups inhabiting the middle of the Silk Road made enormous profits from the trade, and they tried to prevent any direct contact between China and the Roman Empire. Who was Fa-hsien the Chinese Buddhist traveller? Fa-hsien was born in the Chinese city of Shansi sometime in the fourth century A.D. As a young man, Fa-hsien became an avid follower of Buddha. He resolved to visit India to see where the Buddha had lived his life and visit temples and shrines of Buddhist teaching. According to an account written by Fa-hsien titled Fo Kua Chi (Record of Buddhist Kingdoms), it took him more than five years to journey from China to central India. “In the desert were numerous evil spirits and scorching winds, causing death to anyone who would meet them,” he wrote. “Above there were no birds, while on the ground there were no animals. One looked as far as one could in all directions for a path to cross, but there was none to choose. Only the dried bones of the dead served as indications.” Fa-hsien wrote of mountains where he climbed sheer cliffs 8,000 feet tall.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:ee994256-6eb6-47f8-895e-06bd595c5def>']}, {'passage': 'Thus, by the mid-1980s, even foreigners with a limited knowledge of Chinese could, with the help of colleagues and translators, find out about China\'s long twentieth-century history of oral history, in much of its diversity and complexity. It seems, though, that this knowledge never entered a broader academic, let alone public, memory. This seeming reluctance to engage with pre-1980s oral history is even more perplexing when considering the article Zuo published in 2015. According to Zuo\'s article, which is based on Chinese publications and does not reference any English-language articles, oral history existed in China before the 1980s, but not in its ""modern form.""

""55 This is also the explanation Zheng Songhui, who described the development of oral history at Chinese libraries in 2008, provided.56 Li Huibo from China Women\'s University differentiates a first phase of oral history defined by state ideology from a ""second phase, the period beginning in the 1980s, when oral history was \'geared to international standards. \'""57 Her British collaborator on a women\'s oral history project, Margaretta Jolly, explained: ""Notably, these [standards] reflect not so much a movement away from the explicitly political approach of the earlier era as a complex mix of European Marxist and feminist [End Page 12] ideas of \'history from below,\' which was partly disseminated through a visit by socialist British oral historian Paul Thompson in 1986. ""58 This is also what the CCOH staff told me. Considering Stave\'s and Kwong\'s articles, I found this assertion that oral history in China began only in the 1980s startling. Zuo argued that current Chinese oral history began only in the mid-1980s, even though oral historians, as he acknowledged, were aware of and informed by earlier research: ""Because of the long tradition of oral history in China and the practice of oral historical research as well as the oral interviews since 1949, Chinese scholars did not feel unfamiliar with the Western concept of oral history when it was introduced into China in the 1980s. The Western theory and method of oral history were smoothly accepted and quickly modified to integrate into the Chinese practice of the oral historical interview.… In 1986, Jing Shun published the first academic article to introduce to Chinese readers the theory and methods of oral history used in Europe and the United States. ""59 But Zuo did not explain what differentiated Chinese and Western oral history practices or what made the latter ""modern."" Zuo argued that since the 1980s, oral history in China has developed along ""two basic tracks."" One included historians using oral history in order to find out about the past; the other included a smaller group of oral historians exploring the theoretical underpinnings of oral history. ""Through the combined efforts of these two groups of scholars,"" he notes, ""oral history quickly took off as a new branch of the discipline of history in China. ""60 In Beijing, I met a few oral historians who had been conducting interviews since the 1980s. Ding Yizhuang, for example, interviewed Manchu women and old Beijingers in the 1990s and published several volumes of their narratives.61 Chen Mo has been interviewing Chinese filmmakers. Both later published books on oral history theory and method. Throughout the Oral History in China Conference they, like others, did not refer to any of the earlier work. Instead, they seemed to agree that oral history in China had begun only in the 1980s and that China now needed to catch up to the standards the West developed. Only Chu Hong-yuan from Taiwan called upon his colleagues not to focus exclusively on Western models but also to remember their own history—without referencing, however, any specific studies, projects, or scholars. As I have noted before, oral historians around the world often lack an awareness—let alone detailed knowledge—of their field\'s [End Page 13] history.62 I do not know enough about oral history in China to say whether such a paradox exists there, but it may be worth investigating, because it might have implications for the development of future studies. Some of the more troubling implications are discussed in the following section.

With this conversation, Nixon had taken\nthe first step toward opening a secret channel through Pakistan\nthat would later prove decisive. 3: Xiong Xianghui, ""The Prelude to the Opening of Sino-American\nRelations,"" Zhonggong dangshi ziliao [CCP History\nMaterials] No. 42 (June 1992), excerpts\nIn the early 1990s, Xiong Xianghui published the first historical\naccount, along with documents, of a special study group tasked\nby Chairman Mao in 1969 to review China\'s strategic policy. Xiong,\nformerly an aide to Zhou Enlai, had been the secretary to this\ngroup, which consisted of four marshals, senior military figures\nwho had been sent to inspect factories during the Cultural Revolution. The four marshals first focused on relations with Moscow just\nas the Sino-Soviet border clashes were breaking out; although\nthey saw the Soviets as dangerous, they doubted that Moscow intended\nto launch war against China. After Lin Biao gave a speech harshly\nattacking U.S. and Soviet imperialism, Mao asked the marshals\nto think outside the box about U.S. and Soviet policy. The four\nmarshals initially doubted that the Soviets and the Americans\nwould act against China either separately or jointly. When the\nborder fighting intensified in August 1969, marshals Chen Yi and\nYe Jianying worried about a confrontation with Moscow and proposed\nplaying the ""card of the United States."" In a separate\nreport, Chen proposed high-level talks with the U.S. in order\nto solve basic problems in the relationship. The fourth line of\nthe third page reproduced here includes the text about playing\nthe American card.

Several months later, Snow met with Mao for five hours\nof talks on 18 December 1970 during which the Chairman said the\n[T]he foreign ministry was studying the matter of admitting\nAmericans from the left, middle, and right to visit China. Should\nrightists like Nixon, who represented the monopoly capitalists,\nbe permitted to come? He should be welcomed because, Mao explained\nat present the problems between China and the US would have\nto be solved with Nixon. Mao would be happy to talk with him,\neither as a tourist or as President. A week later, perhaps to reaffirm that something was afoot with\nSino-American relations, People\'s Daily published a picture\nof Mao and Snow from the National Day event. While the China expert\nAllen Whiting proposed going to Switzerland to debrief Snow about\nhis trip to China and meetings with the leadership, John Holdridge,\nthe China expert on Kissinger\'s staff, advised against that on\nthe grounds that Snow was a leftist.

                ""text"": ""By Xinhua Writers Liang Linlin, Liu Hua\nBEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Liu Baicheng, an 81-year-old professor of mechanical engineering at Tsinghua University, is happy to recall his 1978 arrival in New York, an occasion that opened the floodgates to 35 years of booming academic exchange between China and the United States. \""Chinese people are great people, and American people are also great people. We came all the way to the United States, not only to learn advanced science and technology, but also to promote the friendship between the Chinese and American peoples,\"" Liu told U.S. reporters upon landing at John. F. Kennedy International Airport on Dec. 26, 1978, five days before the historic establishment of China-U.S. diplomatic ties. Liu quoted those words again at a recent event held to mark the 35th anniversary of the opening of the academic exchange program. Over the three and a half decades, 1.46 million Chinese have studied in the United States while more than 220,000 Americans have studied in China. Liu was 45 in 1978, but not the oldest among the 52-strong group that was the first batch of \""students\"" dispatched by the Chinese government to the United States since 1949. In the late 1970s, after a decade-long Cultural Revolution that had restricted higher education, it was not easy to find suitable English-speaking university graduates in China. Before going to the United States, Liu was a lecturer at Tsinghua. According to an agreement reached by the two countries, the U.S. side would accept 500 to 700 Chinese students and academics while China would accept 60 students from the United States in the 1978/1979 academic year. \""It took us more than 30 hours to fly from Beijing to New York, via Paris, as there was no direct flight between the two cities,\"" Liu said, recalling how all the Chinese passengers wore brand-new, uniform dark suits. The night before their departure, a Chinese vice premier bade farewell to the group at Beijing's Great Hall of the People. In Washington D.C., Liu and other Chinese scholars witnessed the opening of the Chinese embassy on Jan. 1, 1979, and later that month they saw Deng Xiaoping visit Jimmy Carter at the White House. While they rubbed shoulders with leaders of both countries, the Chinese academics were also celebrities themselves in the United States. From their first appearance at the airport, they became a center of attention. A lot of Americans were eager to learn from these messengers about a mysterious country which had been isolated from the rest of the world for many years. After three months of English training, the scholars were dispersed to U.S. universities. Liu went to the University of Wisconsin-Madison and studied there for a year and a half. \""Rarely did I cook for myself at weekends during the first three months of my stay in Wisconsin,\"" Liu said, as many people -- students from Hong Kong and Taiwan, as well as American friends -- invited him to meals over which they could ask about the situation in China. He also welcomed opportunities to speak at local schools. Studying in the United States turned out to be a milestone of his career. Liu, a researcher of materials science and engineering, was exposed to scientific instruments which he had never seen in China, such as advanced microscopes. He was able to look more closely into the micro world of materials. Liu also signed up for computer courses and had a good command of computing languages by the time he left the United States. After returning to his home country in 1981, Liu brought up the idea of applying computers to the casting process and made important contributions to the new field of integrated computational materials engineering. In 1999, the pioneering academic was named a fellow of the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE). Some two months after Liu's departure at the end of 1978, the first group of U.S. scholars arrived in Beijing. Frank Hawke was one of them. Hawke, 25 years old at the time, was a major in political science at Stanford University. \""Although I studied Chinese politics, I had never dreamed of studying in China one day,\"" Hawke said when recalling his experience. Nevertheless, he has since made a life for himself in China, spending 33 of the past 35 years in his adopted country, marrying a Chinese woman and having two Chinese-American kids."",

“And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace for those who make peace.” – James 3:18
In last week’s column we beseeched the social partners to unite under the leadership of the new Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago. Now, we wish that the youthful energy in the new Cabinet of the twin island nation infuses the entire Caribbean. This is indeed a gargantuan task but let us make a start with the agricultural sector. People are our most important resource and have to be fed. Agriculture is a science which guides farmers as they cultivate the soil for the growing of crops and the rearing of animals to provide food and other products for local and tourist consumption. Agricultural goods can be grown for export, to reduce the massive agricultural import bill and contribute to net foreign exchange earnings. Locally grown agricultural produce is more easily quality controlled and gets from farm to table in a much shorter time than imported produce. Many locally grown products reach the consumer at a cheaper price than imported products and selected products provide our full complement of nutrients. Why then do we not have a comprehensive coordinated programme for agricultural development in the Caribbean rather than a piecemeal approach by territory. This approach has not produced a sustainable solution in the last 70 years since the Report of West India Royal Commission, also known as The Moyne Report, was published at the end of the second world war. Many billions of dollars of national and donor funds have been wasted. Although not formally trained in agriculture science, I have been associated with the full spectrum of agriculturalists and the agricultural sector for my entire professional life and I am still involved in one way or another. Having been trained as a Mathematician, Statistician and Operations Research scientist in Jamaica, Wales and at the Imperial College of Science and Technology in London, I interned as a Biometrician at Rothamsted Research, formerly known as Rothamsted Experimental Station, which is the longest running agricultural research station in the world, providing cutting-edge science and innovation for nearly 170 years. The establishment of the Biometrics unit at the Faculty of Agriculture at University of the West Indies at St. Augustine Trinidad (1968) was my first professional assignment and it is still in operation today under the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute. I was President of the Caribbean Agro-Economic Society, the Barbados Society for Technologists in Agriculture and am currently Chairman of the recently launched Global Business Innovation Corporation which encapsulates the key components of the Caribbean Food Business Innovation Revolution. In addition, I was an avid vegetable gardener at least twice in my life, have been involved in many agricultural development consultancies and given advice to many post graduate agricultural students over the years. Eat Bajan Day this year is on October 9. This is managed by the Graham Gooding Trust of which I am a Trustee. Quite a lot has rubbed off from these experiences and if I do not know any specific detail in agriculture at least I know who to ask. My primary interest is in shepherding businesses to sustainable success. Agriculture is a business and my continuing interest in the sector is to contribute to its success at the enterprise, national and regional levels. I propose a simple 5M business system construct as follows: The Model (Idea/innovation) is at the Core (Corporate Governance); The Money (outlay) provides the Stamina (Investment Finance); The Marketing (sales) is the Life (Marketing); The Methodology (shepherding) is the Growth (Operations); and the Mind-set Change (shepherding) inspires sustainability (People Development). The high inherent business risks in the agricultural sector are associated with the above five business systems. Corporate Governance risks – 3: (1) there is little or no focus on management meeting culture to structure the foundation of the business; (2) failure to observe legal and environmental laws reflecting society’s priorities or industry mandates; and (3) deleterious impact on the natural resource base. Investment Finance risks -2: (1) little or no focus on credit rating culture; and (2) low equity input by the entrepreneur in the business. Marketing risks – 4: (1) little or no focus on customer centric culture; (2) no proactive aggressive market led sales and distribution strategy; (3) unrealistic sales projections especially for start-ups, re-births, spin-offs and scale-ups; and (4) unpredictable prices and markets.

The Caribbean is often associated with tantalising images of captivating, blue waters lapping on white, sandy shores; lush, green forests encapsulating villages; and birds freely soaring through azure skies. Consisting of over seven thousand islands, islets, reefs, and cays framed by the Gulf of Mexico, North, South, and Central America, the Caribbean is one of the most revered tropical tourist destinations in the world. The region is a biodiversity hotspot, with an extensive range of rich ecosystems; many of which are vulnerable to the manifestation of the effects of climate change and other anthropogenic occurrences.

On 26 July 1953, approximately 160 young men stormed the Moncada barracks in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba in a revolt against then dictator Fulgencio Batista. The revolt, spearheaded by a 26-year-old lawyer, Fidel Castro, did not succeed at first. However, it marked the beginning of almost six years of revolution that eventually re-shaped the political structure of Cuba and also affected the greater Caribbean region. Alongside key figures such as Che Guevara, Raúl Castro, and Camilo Cienfuegos, Castro and his revolution succeeded in ousting Batista. After the Cuban Revolution, a new era dawned in Cuba. It saw the rise of Castro, becoming both a revered and reviled leader who stood firmly against the western capitalist system, principally embodied by the United States at the time. During the height of the Cold War, Castro also opted to form close ties with the Soviet Union. Cuba loses its revolutionary leader

In the first of this three-part series dedicated to Calypso History Month, we learned that calypso is a genre of music which has played a very important role in the processes of confrontation, revolution, and revival in the Caribbean, as well as the invention and establishment of the Caribbean identity and heritage. Secondly, we saw that, overtime, women have risen from obscurity to become strong pillars in the development and internationalisation of calypso music, allowing for greater diversity and a more holistic view of Caribbean society. Now, we look at the fluidity of calypso and the effect time has had on this genre. Continue reading “The Evolution of Calypso and Birth of Soca Music”

Calypso is an authentic Trinbagonian pastiche. It is almost impossible to imagine a true examination of cultural creation in Trinidad and Tobago that does not include calypso. If you mean to truly understand Trinbagonian, and by extension Caribbean culture beyond what may be skimmed from the top, it is important to delve into the genre. The lyrics and harmonies will create a deeper understanding of a Caribbean identity composed of quintessential variance. Likewise, calypso provides a sonic focal point for insight into the Caribbean woman’s existence. Continue reading “The Rise Of Calypso Woman”
“…all Caribbeans know, more or less intuitively that in the final analysis, the only sure possession the undertow of history has left them is their paradoxical culture.” – Antonio Benitez Rojo
Out of the ashes, we rise. Darkness will always make way for the dawn, and just as mother nature defies logic and shoots fresh grass from beneath concrete, the human spirit endures. Drawing on these principles, we observe the most famous musical genre coming out of the Caribbean – Calypso. The diversity of the music in the region is hinged on the influence of our enslaved ancestors as well as the external forces that impressed upon the society over time. Music plays a significant role in the construct of cultural identity. As one of the most complex forms of human cultural expressions, music epitomises a culture’s most fundamental values.

The other members were: Ray Jones, who, with 20 years’ experience of farming in the Midwest, was appointed farm manager; Jim Bogue, who had spent 18 years raising beef and dairy cattle; Tom Grubbs, with 15 years’ experience cultivating citrus orchards; and Russell Moton, a graduate agronomist who had specialized in agricultural economics. None of these men had any experience or expertise in tropical agriculture, although Moton was ‘now taking courses’ in that field. There is evidence that Jones was not aware how different farming in the tropics was from farming in the U.S. There are several accounts of agronomists’ frustration with Jones’ lack of understanding of these differences. Jones insisted that beans brought over from the U.S. should grow, but that did not make them grow. Similarly, most of the pigs they tried to raise died, perhaps because they were not the right sort of pigs for the tropics. Perhaps they would have done better with a pig-like species native to Amazonia, such as the peccary. The pioneers could surely have benefited from more expert advice. And the advice was there for the taking, from such places as the College of Tropical Agriculture at the University of Hawaii and – closer to Guyana – St. Augustine in the Caribbean island nation of Trinidad. Was the only reason Jonestown made no attempt to involve experts from either of these institutions due to the fact that they were not members of Peoples Temple? Judging by the discussions recorded in Edith Roller’s journal, agriculture at Jonestown was still in deep trouble in 1978. New sows had been acquired, but more and more of their piglets were dying. The cows were giving too little milk. Had they bought the wrong kind of cows? Had they been swindled? Some vegetables were doing well, others were not. Books about tropical agriculture had been ordered and were arriving, and Jones urged a big effort to study them. But still, many things were going wrong, and no one seemed to know why. Coupled with Jones’ lack of knowledge and experience was his increasing paranoia that the CIA was conspiring against them. The agency’s experiments with weather modification were altering amounts of rainfall in the Northwest District, he claimed, and their saboteurs had infiltrated into Jonestown, secretly injecting poison into the eggs. Certain crops did thrive at Jonestown – eddoes, sweet potatoes, and especially cassava – but unfortunately, these were foods very low in vitamins and minerals. Too rapid a growth in the population of the settlement
During the early years (1974-77), the three dozen or so Jonestown pioneers seem to have been making modest progress. According to a progress report issued in the summer of 1977, their expectation was that the settlement would pass through a third ‘intermediate’ stage, lasting one year and bringing the population up to between 70 and 100. Then a fourth ‘substantial’ stage lasting two years would allow the population to grow to about 500 by 1980. However, it appears that they did not anticipate that the settlement was ever going to accommodate more than about 500 people. Then suddenly, in August 1977, in response to the imminent publication of a critical exposé of Peoples Temple in New West magazine, Jones made an on-the-spot decision to leave the United States for Guyana and move as many members of Peoples Temple to Jonestown as he could as quickly as possible. In the course of a year, 1000 Temple members emigrated in Guyana, almost all of whom lived in Jonestown. Moreover, a large proportion of the new arrivals were either too young or too old to work. This unanticipated rapid influx of new arrivals led inevitably to a sharp fall in the standard of living. Overcrowding was exacerbated. The quality of food deteriorated, with increased reliance on imported rice. Administration must have become much less effective: the new situation changed the demands placed on it, making previous planning less relevant. The arrival of Jones, with his delusions and his inconsistent and idiosyncratic managerial style, must have had a strong disorganizing effect. Setting too short a period for achieving self-sufficiency
In the summer of 1977, the pioneers estimated that Jonestown would need at least another three and possibly five years to achieve economic self-sufficiency.

How great a role did the abolitionists play in ending slavery in the British West Indies in 1834? The abolitionists played a very vital role in the abolition of the slave trade and the abolition of slavery itself. The movement to end slavery began in 1823 with the formation of the Society for Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery and the efforts continued with the Agency Committee formed in 1831.There were other mitigating circumstances which also favored the abolitionists such as the Reform Act, the economic decline of West India sugar, social unrest of the slaves and the Industrial revolution. All these factors contributed to the gradual ending of slavery in the British West Indies. They were also aware of the huge commercial and economic power of the Caribbean planter interest. By the 1820’s it was obvious that slavery was still well established in the Caribbean. Facing this reality, the old members of the abolitionist society met in 1823 and formed the London Society for Mitigating and Gradually Abolition of Slavery. Thomas Clarkson, a member travelled ten thousand miles trying to get support and to encourage the formation of local organizations. His efforts resulted in the formation of two hundred and thirty local organizations. The main strategy was the preparation of petitions and by 1824 seven hundred and seventy seven petitions was sent to Parliament calling for the total abolition of slavery. Parliament’s response was limited choosing to focus on the improvement of the slaves’ lives by setting forth the Amelioration proposals. The responsibility for implementing the proposals was given to the colonial assemblies but little or nothing was actually done. Many Christians complained of being abused by the plantocracy and the continuous bad treatment of the slaves. The slaves believed that the Amelioration Proposals meant freedom and this rumor caused an uproar amongst the slaves who wanted to take action against the planters for withholding their...

Now, we wish that the youthful energy in the new Cabinet of the twin island nation infuses the entire Caribbean. This is indeed a gargantuan task but let us make a start with the agricultural sector. People are our most important resource and have to be fed. Agriculture is a science which guides farmers as they cultivate the soil for the growing of crops and the rearing of animals to provide food and other products for local and tourist consumption. Agricultural goods can be grown for export, to reduce the massive agricultural import bill and contribute to net foreign exchange earnings. Locally grown agricultural produce is more easily quality controlled and gets from farm to table in a much shorter time than imported produce. Many locally grown products reach the consumer at a cheaper price than imported products and selected products provide our full complement of nutrients. Why then do we not have a comprehensive coordinated programme for agricultural development in the Caribbean rather than a piecemeal approach by territory. This approach has not produced a sustainable solution in the last 70 years since the Report of West India Royal Commission, also known as The Moyne Report, was published at the end of the second world war. Many billions of dollars of national and donor funds have been wasted. Although not formally trained in agriculture science, I have been associated with the full spectrum of agriculturalists and the agricultural sector for my entire professional life and I am still involved in one way or another. Having been trained as a Mathematician, Statistician and Operations Research scientist in Jamaica, Wales and at the Imperial College of Science and Technology in London, I interned as a Biometrician at Rothamsted Research, formerly known as Rothamsted Experimental Station, which is the longest running agricultural research station in the world, providing cutting-edge science and innovation for nearly 170 years. The establishment of the Biometrics unit at the Faculty of Agriculture at University of the West Indies at St. Augustine Trinidad (1968) was my first professional assignment and it is still in operation today under the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute. I was President of the Caribbean Agro-Economic Society, the Barbados Society for Technologists in Agriculture and am currently Chairman of the recently launched Global Business Innovation Corporation which encapsulates the key components of the Caribbean Food Business Innovation Revolution. In addition, I was an avid vegetable gardener at least twice in my life, have been involved in many agricultural development consultancies and given advice to many post graduate agricultural students over the years.

Agriculture is a business and my continuing interest in the sector is to contribute to its success at the enterprise, national and regional levels. I propose a simple 5M business system construct as follows: The Model (Idea/innovation) is at the Core (Corporate Governance); The Money (outlay) provides the Stamina (Investment Finance); The Marketing (sales) is the Life (Marketing); The Methodology (shepherding) is the Growth (Operations); and the Mind-set Change (shepherding) inspires sustainability (People Development). The high inherent business risks in the agricultural sector are associated with the above five business systems. Corporate Governance risks – 3: (1) there is little or no focus on management meeting culture to structure the foundation of the business; (2) failure to observe legal and environmental laws reflecting society’s priorities or industry mandates; and (3) deleterious impact on the natural resource base. Investment Finance risks -2: (1) little or no focus on credit rating culture; and (2) low equity input by the entrepreneur in the business. Marketing risks – 4: (1) little or no focus on customer centric culture; (2) no proactive aggressive market led sales and distribution strategy; (3) unrealistic sales projections especially for start-ups, re-births, spin-offs and scale-ups; and (4) unpredictable prices and markets.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:33fc80d5-dcdd-4ff6-97d5-2e47fb4103af>']}, {'passage': ""Push and pull factors drive the decision to stay or move.

The revolt, spearheaded by a 26-year-old lawyer, Fidel Castro, did not succeed at first. However, it marked the beginning of almost six years of revolution that eventually re-shaped the political structure of Cuba and also affected the greater Caribbean region. Alongside key figures such as Che Guevara, Raúl Castro, and Camilo Cienfuegos, Castro and his revolution succeeded in ousting Batista. After the Cuban Revolution, a new era dawned in Cuba. It saw the rise of Castro, becoming both a revered and reviled leader who stood firmly against the western capitalist system, principally embodied by the United States at the time.

None of these men had any experience or expertise in tropical agriculture, although Moton was ‘now taking courses’ in that field. There is evidence that Jones was not aware how different farming in the tropics was from farming in the U.S. There are several accounts of agronomists’ frustration with Jones’ lack of understanding of these differences. Jones insisted that beans brought over from the U.S. should grow, but that did not make them grow. Similarly, most of the pigs they tried to raise died, perhaps because they were not the right sort of pigs for the tropics. Perhaps they would have done better with a pig-like species native to Amazonia, such as the peccary. The pioneers could surely have benefited from more expert advice. And the advice was there for the taking, from such places as the College of Tropical Agriculture at the University of Hawaii and – closer to Guyana – St. Augustine in the Caribbean island nation of Trinidad. Was the only reason Jonestown made no attempt to involve experts from either of these institutions due to the fact that they were not members of Peoples Temple? Judging by the discussions recorded in Edith Roller’s journal, agriculture at Jonestown was still in deep trouble in 1978. New sows had been acquired, but more and more of their piglets were dying. The cows were giving too little milk. Had they bought the wrong kind of cows? Had they been swindled? Some vegetables were doing well, others were not. Books about tropical agriculture had been ordered and were arriving, and Jones urged a big effort to study them. But still, many things were going wrong, and no one seemed to know why. Coupled with Jones’ lack of knowledge and experience was his increasing paranoia that the CIA was conspiring against them. The agency’s experiments with weather modification were altering amounts of rainfall in the Northwest District, he claimed, and their saboteurs had infiltrated into Jonestown, secretly injecting poison into the eggs. Certain crops did thrive at Jonestown – eddoes, sweet potatoes, and especially cassava – but unfortunately, these were foods very low in vitamins and minerals. Too rapid a growth in the population of the settlement\nDuring the early years (1974-77), the three dozen or so Jonestown pioneers seem to have been making modest progress. According to a progress report issued in the summer of 1977, their expectation was that the settlement would pass through a third ‘intermediate’ stage, lasting one year and bringing the population up to between 70 and 100. Then a fourth ‘substantial’ stage lasting two years would allow the population to grow to about 500 by 1980. However, it appears that they did not anticipate that the settlement was ever going to accommodate more than about 500 people. Then suddenly, in August 1977, in response to the imminent publication of a critical exposé of Peoples Temple in New West magazine, Jones made an on-the-spot decision to leave the United States for Guyana and move as many members of Peoples Temple to Jonestown as he could as quickly as possible. In the course of a year, 1000 Temple members emigrated in Guyana, almost all of whom lived in Jonestown. Moreover, a large proportion of the new arrivals were either too young or too old to work. This unanticipated rapid influx of new arrivals led inevitably to a sharp fall in the standard of living. Overcrowding was exacerbated. The quality of food deteriorated, with increased reliance on imported rice. Administration must have become much less effective: the new situation changed the demands placed on it, making previous planning less relevant. The arrival of Jones, with his delusions and his inconsistent and idiosyncratic managerial style, must have had a strong disorganizing effect.

The movement to end slavery began in 1823 with the formation of the Society for Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery and the efforts continued with the Agency Committee formed in 1831.There were other mitigating circumstances which also favored the abolitionists such as the Reform Act, the economic decline of West India sugar, social unrest of the slaves and the Industrial revolution. All these factors contributed to the gradual ending of slavery in the British West Indies. They were also aware of the huge commercial and economic power of the Caribbean planter interest. By the 1820’s it was obvious that slavery was still well established in the Caribbean. Facing this reality, the old members of the abolitionist society met in 1823 and formed the London Society for Mitigating and Gradually Abolition of Slavery. Thomas Clarkson, a member travelled ten thousand miles trying to get support and to encourage the formation of local organizations. His efforts resulted in the formation of two hundred and thirty local organizations. The main strategy was the preparation of petitions and by 1824 seven hundred and seventy seven petitions was sent to Parliament calling for the total abolition of slavery. Parliament’s response was limited choosing to focus on the improvement of the slaves’ lives by setting forth the Amelioration proposals. The responsibility for implementing the proposals was given to the colonial assemblies but little or nothing was actually done.

We are painfully aware of the tremendous loss to the agricultural sector and indeed to Dominica as a whole as a result of the passing of this distinguished and very accomplished agricultural officer. His outstanding and immense contribution to agriculture development in Dominica , the Windward Islands and the Caribbean region is well acknowledged. Many officers from the Ministry of Agriculture in Grenada have met and have interacted with Mr. Allport over the years in countless meetings, workshops, training sessions etc. and they are all unanimously in agreement that he has always stood out as a vivacious, high energetic, exceptionally knowledgeable and keen contributor to every discussion that he has been involved in. He would undoubtedly be greatly missed by the entire farming fraternity in the region. On behalf of the Honourable Minister of Agriculture, Honourable Denis Michael Lett, Permanent Secretary, Mr. Aaron Francois, senior members of staff of the Ministry of Agriculture and other staff, farmers and other key stakeholders of the farming fraternity in Grenada, I would like to express our deepest and most profound sympathy to the entire staff of the Ministry of Agriculture, Dominica, his wife Mrs. Ruth Allport and children and all members of the agriculture community in the Nature Isle. While words cannot effectively convey and mitigate the very deep pain that you all are feeling at this time, we would like you to know that our prayers and sympathy are with you in these difficult times."",

                ""text"": ""Agriculture refers to the growing of crops and rearing of animals. Throughout much of the Caribbean\u2019s history, agriculture has been an important economic activity. Agriculture remains important today for many reasons:\n- It provides employment. In many Caribbean countries, agriculture employs about 10 to 25 percent of the working population. - Many Caribbean countries import more agricultural products than they export. Producing food locally reduces the need to import food from other countries. - It provides fresh food\n- It provides raw materials for many manufacturing industries such as food processing. - Many of the region\u2019s major exports are agricultural products. Various Caribbean countries export crops like bananas, cocoa and rice to other countries within or outside of the Caribbean. Trends in Caribbean Agriculture\n- In the past, agriculture was a major employer in the Caribbean. However, today, agriculture generally employs a small percentage of the workforce. Services such as tourism now employ the majority of the workforce. Most farmers are older folk as few young people want to become farmers. - Many agricultural products from the region were given preferential treatment in the EU in the past. Caribbean bananas, for instance, were given priority until 1992. Also sugar producers were allowed to export a given quantity of sugar to Europe. However, many of these preferential arrangements no longer exist or have been reduced. - In the past, agriculture was a major contributor to GDP in the region. It was also a major foreign exchange earner. However, today the situation is very different. In many territories, agriculture is responsible for only a small percentage of GDP and earns only a small proportion of foreign exchange. According to the FAO, in many Caribbean countries, agriculture \u201ccontributes between 7 and 17 percent of GDP\u201d. The graph below was taken from a document produced by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). It shows the percentage of GDP that agriculture is responsible for in many Caribbean countries. - Generally, less land is being used for agriculture in the region now than in the past. In the case of peasant farmers, farms are small and often fragmented. FAO. 2019.

Meanwhile, the CARICOM Secretariat has created a Caribbean Agribusiness website with an ambitious agenda. This website is meant, eventually, to be a major internet portal integrating existing initiatives and relevant institutions, such as ministries of agriculture, producer organisations, agribusiness associations and inter-governmental organisations, to name a few, and serving as the hub for all matters in which business persons (at all scales of operation) have an interest \u2013 up-to-date information, statistics, trade and investment opportunities and policy issues.

The importance of embracing ICTs by the CARICOM\u2019s agricultural sector cannot be overstated. Both public sector institutions and the private sector have to show leadership if the mandates to increase production and promote trade and food security are to be met.

                ""text"": ""This column is being written before The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Canc\u00fan, Mexico and I\u2019m trying not to be influenced by the increasing number of critics who are predicting a dismal outcome. Will it lead to bold, courageous steps into the future or retrace footprints of the past? In the Caribbean, one can be excused for focusing on how climate change impacts tourism, but just as important, if not more so, is the impact on agriculture. According to the International Food Policy Research Institute, \u201cWith no climate change, the number of malnourished children in Latin America and the Caribbean will decline from about 7.7 million to 5 million between 2000 and 2050. Climate change will eliminate much of this progress, resulting in 6.4 million malnourished children in 2050. That is 1.4 million more than in a no-climate change scenario.\u201d Today the Caribbean imports most of its food at a cost of approximately US$4 billon every year. This has to be a cause for concern. Couple this with the weather conditions that can wipe out an island\u2019s major export crop in one wet and windy afternoon, then we have a very high risk situation. Agriculture is intimately associated with climate change, food security and rural development. The point was made by Michael Hailu, Director of The Netherlandsbased Technical Centre for Agriculture and Rural Cooperation-African, Pacific and the Caribbean (CTA), during a CWA session in October. Climate change, said Mr. Hailu, impacts agriculture in many ways, from changes in rainfall distribution, to the possibility of changes in the frequency and severity of extreme climate events and increases in outbreaks of pests and diseases. What is sometimes forgotten is that agriculture is also a contributor to climate change. Mr. Hailu noted that \u201cemissions from agriculture and related practices account for 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. That figure increases to about 30\npercent if deforestation \u2013 largely due to land conversion for agriculture \u2013 is included.\u201d The CTA boss believes how agriculture is conducted in the future will have a profound impact on whether it will be part of the solution for climate change or continue to be part of the problem. He called on ACP member states to meet climate change challenges through adaptation of relevant technology, sustainable agricultural practices linked to good land and water management among other strategies. In other words: a change of thinking, a change of attitude. As part of a global effort to include agriculture in the final climate change agreement, CTA co-sponsored the Agriculture and Rural Development Day at the Cancun meetings. Dr. Arlington Chesney, executive director of the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI), believes this is significant. At the opening of the Caribbean Rural Development Briefings in Grenada, Dr. Chesney said this is an important development because agriculture has been in the wings of the climate change discussion. Agriculture contributes to climate, but it can also be part of the mitigation process. In other words: a change of thinking, a change of attitude. Dr. Chesney explained that Caribbean governments have resolved that there should be a significant level of food security. The target is for 25 percent of the food in the region to be produced in the region. He noted there has been a switch from food security to food sovereignty. Defining food security as the ability of countries to buy food, Dr. Chesney explained that food sovereignty is the ability of the Caribbean to produce its own food, at least the major food groups, in the region. Governments want to place more cultivation emphasis on tubers and root crops like ground provisions. He said there are lessons to be learned from the current wheat crisis in Russia that should result in a reduction in dependence on wheat flour imports. In other\nwords: a change of thinking, a change of attitude. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations has been promoting Climate-Smart Agriculture. On its new web site (http://www.fao.org/climatechange/ climatesmart/en/) the FAO offers examples of how farming can prepare for a warmer world and reduce emissions. On the site is stated\u2026\u201cFood security and climate change can be addressed together by transforming agriculture and adopting practices that are climate-smart.\u201d In other words: a change of thinking, a change of attitude."",

Now, we wish that the youthful energy in the new Cabinet of the twin island nation infuses the entire Caribbean. This is indeed a gargantuan task but let us make a start with the agricultural sector. People are our most important resource and have to be fed. Agriculture is a science which guides farmers as they cultivate the soil for the growing of crops and the rearing of animals to provide food and other products for local and tourist consumption. Agricultural goods can be grown for export, to reduce the massive agricultural import bill and contribute to net foreign exchange earnings. Locally grown agricultural produce is more easily quality controlled and gets from farm to table in a much shorter time than imported produce. Many locally grown products reach the consumer at a cheaper price than imported products and selected products provide our full complement of nutrients. Why then do we not have a comprehensive coordinated programme for agricultural development in the Caribbean rather than a piecemeal approach by territory. This approach has not produced a sustainable solution in the last 70 years since the Report of West India Royal Commission, also known as The Moyne Report, was published at the end of the second world war. Many billions of dollars of national and donor funds have been wasted. Although not formally trained in agriculture science, I have been associated with the full spectrum of agriculturalists and the agricultural sector for my entire professional life and I am still involved in one way or another. Having been trained as a Mathematician, Statistician and Operations Research scientist in Jamaica, Wales and at the Imperial College of Science and Technology in London, I interned as a Biometrician at Rothamsted Research, formerly known as Rothamsted Experimental Station, which is the longest running agricultural research station in the world, providing cutting-edge science and innovation for nearly 170 years. The establishment of the Biometrics unit at the Faculty of Agriculture at University of the West Indies at St. Augustine Trinidad (1968) was my first professional assignment and it is still in operation today under the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute. I was President of the Caribbean Agro-Economic Society, the Barbados Society for Technologists in Agriculture and am currently Chairman of the recently launched Global Business Innovation Corporation which encapsulates the key components of the Caribbean Food Business Innovation Revolution. In addition, I was an avid vegetable gardener at least twice in my life, have been involved in many agricultural development consultancies and given advice to many post graduate agricultural students over the years. Eat Bajan Day this year is on October 9. This is managed by the Graham Gooding Trust of which I am a Trustee. Quite a lot has rubbed off from these experiences and if I do not know any specific detail in agriculture at least I know who to ask. My primary interest is in shepherding businesses to sustainable success. Agriculture is a business and my continuing interest in the sector is to contribute to its success at the enterprise, national and regional levels. I propose a simple 5M business system construct as follows: The Model (Idea/innovation) is at the Core (Corporate Governance); The Money (outlay) provides the Stamina (Investment Finance); The Marketing (sales) is the Life (Marketing); The Methodology (shepherding) is the Growth (Operations); and the Mind-set Change (shepherding) inspires sustainability (People Development). The high inherent business risks in the agricultural sector are associated with the above five business systems. Corporate Governance risks \u2013 3: (1) there is little or no focus on management meeting culture to structure the foundation of the business; (2) failure to observe legal and environmental laws reflecting society\u2019s priorities or industry mandates; and (3) deleterious impact on the natural resource base. Investment Finance risks -2: (1) little or no focus on credit rating culture; and (2) low equity input by the entrepreneur in the business. Marketing risks \u2013 4: (1) little or no focus on customer centric culture; (2) no proactive aggressive market led sales and distribution strategy; (3) unrealistic sales projections especially for start-ups, re-births, spin-offs and scale-ups; and (4) unpredictable prices and markets."",

46,<urn:uuid:dd0dd09e-58d1-45f4-98ab-564e33cabb0f>,"Bipolar, formerly known as manic depression, is characterized by mood dysregulation resulting in one or more episodes of abnormally increased energy level, mood, and cognition, that alternate with one or more depressive episodes. Bipolar affects approximately 2.6% of the adult population in the United States. Although bipolar symptoms can emerge at any time, the typical age of onset is between 18 and 25. Bipolar affects men and women equally. There are some factors that increase the risk of bipolar including: The manic phase may last one week or more and is characterized by increased energy and an elevated or irritable mood that is present for most of the day. Diagnosis requires the presence of three or more of these symptoms: Symptoms of hypomanic episodes are similar, but tend to be shorter in duration, lasting four days or more. Psychotic symptoms are not present during hypomanic episodes, and the symptoms are not so severe as to require hospitalization. Hypomanic symptoms are common among all the bipolar diagnoses, but manic episodes are symptomatic solely of bipolar I. The depressive phase of bipolar includes at least five symptoms of major depression that last for at least two weeks, including: While bipolar cannot be cured, it can be managed effectively. Psychotherapy can help people with bipolar by teaching them how to recognize triggers so they can understand or possibly avoid them, decrease negatively expressed emotions, and practice healthy coping skills. Finding a therapist or counselor with whom you can establish a healthy therapeutic relationship may help develop some of the following skills for managing bipolar: Some types of psychotherapy such as family-focused and dialectable therapies are effective in preventing relapses. Although the research clearly demonstrates that bipolar often has an organic ideology, psychotherapy has been proven to be an effective treatment. Medication is also commonly used in the treatment of bipolar. Another myth about bipolar is that it is only caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. While there is an organic component to it, bipolar is typically influenced by a variety of factors including environment and experience. Finally, it is a myth that people with bipolar cannot lead a normal life. Bipolar can be effectively managed with treatment, and many people with bipolar experience long periods of remission.

### Context: ""Can I see the test results, please?"" Let’s start with a true story. A colleague of mine in the US heard that her grandson had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital. As a long-standing critic of the psychiatric system she was concerned for his welfare and went to see him. She discovered that in the first few days he had been drugged into a stupor and she insisted on seeing the medical staff. Three psychiatrists told her that, sadly, her grandson had a bipolar disorder caused by a brain bio-chemical imbalance. Quietly, but firmly, she asked what evidence they had there was something wrong with his brain. They said that his mood and behaviour indicated a serious problem. She asked how they knew this problem was caused by brain biochemistry. Slightly uncomfortable, they vaguely referred to studies that indicated that this was the case. Much more confident now, my colleague responded that she knew of no studies that had ever confirmed this idea even though it is a common assumption in the psychiatric world. For good measure she quoted some studies that indicated that there was nothing wrong with the brains of people with all sorts of psychiatric labels. Sensing that they were dealing with someone who might actually have read the literature they asked what she wanted. Her grandson was quickly transferred to a unit offering talking therapies. My colleague didn’t ask the question that all patients, relatives and advocates should ask when confronted with the claim that a brain biochemical problem lies at the root of someone’s low mood or strange behaviour. She could have said, ""Can I see the test results, please?"" The truth is that, unlike all other branches of medicine, psychiatrists do not do physical tests on people to confirm their diagnoses. The reason is simple: there is nothing wrong with the brains of people diagnosed schizophrenic, bi-polar, depressed and so on. The organic hypothesis remains just that; an unproven hypothesis. Claims continue to be made in the scientific literature and popular press. David Cohen, another US activist, has noted that almost all the substances operating within the human body have been investigated as a possible cause of schizophrenia. This research is leaked to the press before it has been accepted in a peer-reviewed journal and ""the results are likely to be cited around the world, thought they may never make it to scientific publication"". We are also well aware of the massive conflicts of interest involved in the studies that do finally appear in the official literature. Effective Health Care, in reviewing the newest so-called anti-psychotic medication concluded, ""Most relevant trials are undertaken by those with clear pecuniary interest in the results""1. There is no validity in psychiatric diagnosis2,3. Even if there were, after almost two hundred years, we have never found anything at all wrong with the brain biochemistry of people diagnosed with a host of so-called disorders. Some, conditions, for example, Alcohol-induced dementia do indeed show real signs of brain damage. This is rare. The studies on all the main diagnostic categories of psychiatry, however, are plagued by a significant problem: the people being tested have almost always already received psychotropic medication. In other words, if there is a blood, brain or liver disorder, this may well have been caused by the drugs, or ECT. Physical tests on people diagnosed, but not yet treated, by psychiatrists, would be the only way to find out if there really were a difference between these people and the general public. This never happens as most people first encounter a GP who, instead of asking for blood and other tests to demonstrate a psychiatric condition, simply prescribe a psychotropic drug or refer on to a psychiatrist. Imagine the same situation in oncology. You are told that you look like you have cancer. There are no tests offered to you. You are told you will have two operations, followed by radiotherapy and a course of drugs that makes your hair fall out. The idea is preposterous. You demand proof of your condition. An x-ray, a CT scan and blood and liver tests reveal that the diagnosis was accurate. Reassured, though still very scared you agree to the treatment. Psychiatrists of course do ask for tests like CT scans on their patients but these are to exclude the possibility of organic damage. In other words, they are checking to see if there is a real brain problem, evidence of illegal drug-use or whatever.

Have you ever stopped to think about how the mental health stigma doesn’t make sense? So many of us walk around feeling ashamed of our struggles, trying to hide them from the rest of the world. Yet functioning with these immense internal difficulties actually evinces our strength! As actress Carrie Fisher wrote in Wishful Drinking:
“Being bipolar can be an all-consuming challenge, requiring a lot of stamina and even more courage, so if you’re living with this illness and functioning at all, it’s something to be proud of, not ashamed of.”
Plus, try this statistic on for size: according to the CDC, nearly 50% of U.S. adults will struggle with at least one mental illness in their lifetime. In this post, we’ll focus on the dual diagnosis of addiction and bipolar disorder. What Is Bipolar Disorder? Bipolar is a mood disorder characterized by emotional swings from high to low. People with bipolar deal with depressive “down” phases and manic “up” phases, and they struggle to find a healthy middle ground. In a depressive state, a person might be immobilized, unable to take care of their usual responsibilities. But in a manic state, that same person might work around the clock. One quick definition for bipolar is “experiencing extremes”. This disorder does have a genetic component, but an individual’s environment matters a great deal as well. Growing up in a physically, mentally, or emotionally traumatic environment is a strong risk factor. Why an Accurate Diagnosis Can Be Difficult
Here are a few key reasons why bipolar disorder can be difficult to diagnose accurately:
First, if a person is under the influence, it’s extremely challenging to provide an accurate diagnosis. Having people detox prior to diagnosis is ideal. Next, the bipolar label has increased in popularity in recent years. This is great for awareness, but it can also lead to misdiagnosis. For example, sometimes people who are dealing with clinical depression are misdiagnosed with bipolar because of the dramatic difference between their low-functioning depressive state and their usual functioning state. Similarly, rigid, black-and-white thinking can be confused with bipolar symptoms, and so can the aftereffects of trauma. Finally, when people have a great deal of conflict in their lives, they may be labeled as bipolar. But when they gain the tools they need to resolve those conflicts, often the level of internal tension changes significantly. In short, understanding bipolar disorder and addiction is critical for accurate diagnosis and treatment. True bipolar disorder involves an imbalance in brain chemistry, and it’s certainly a serious condition. Yet in our experience in running a residential addiction treatment center, we see people misdiagnosed as bipolar when in reality they have mental and emotional issues causing a lot of upset in their lives. That’s not brain chemistry; that’s just upset. We find that when such people heal those issues, the upset in their lives decreases dramatically. The Connection Between Addiction and Bipolar Disorder
Bipolar disorder is part of a family of mood disorders, including depression, anxiety, and seasonal affective disorder (SAD). While mood disorders can be caused or exacerbated by drug use, more often people with mood disorders use addictive substances to self-medicate. Many people with bipolar turn to substances during their depressive states. There is a particularly strong connection between bipolar and addiction. Statistics from DualDiagnosis.org suggest that 56% of people with bipolar disorder have experienced drug addiction. Healing from Bipolar and Addiction
September is National Recovery Month, and it’s also Self Awareness Month. This is fitting, as you can’t really have one without the other. Self awareness is an essential component of recovery, especially when you’re dealing with a dual diagnosis. That said, medication certainly has its place as well. If you find that you continue to struggle with emotional extremes after you’ve detoxed from substances, then medication may give you the support you need to maintain emotional stability. However, don’t shortchange yourself by skipping over the mental and emotional issues that contribute to mood disorders. Finding and addressing the root causes of physical disorders can minimize (or eliminate!) the need for medications to treat symptoms, and the same is true for emotional disorders. What Counseling Strategies Work Well with Bipolar?

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two genes that influence the activity of nerve cells in the brain may play a key role in a person's risk for bipolar disorder, marked by dramatic swings from depression to manic behavior, researchers said on Sunday. The findings are not expected to lead to a genetic test for the risk of the condition but could help unravel the mystery of how it arises and lead to better treatments, they reported in the journal Nature Genetics. An international team of scientists examined the genomes of 10,596 people mainly from Britain and the United States, including 4,387 with bipolar disorder, also sometimes known as manic-depression. The researchers found those with bipolar disorder more likely to have certain variants of the ANK3 and CACNA1C genes. Proteins made by the two genes help govern the flow of sodium and calcium ions into and out of neurons in the brain, influencing the activity of these nerve cells. ""The key importance of this is that it gives us a clear idea of the sorts of chemicals and mechanisms in the brain that are involved in bipolar disorder,"" Nick Craddock of Britain's Cardiff University, who helped lead the study, said in a telephone interview. ""Over a number of years, that will help researchers to develop better approaches to diagnosis and treatment."" Because it tends to run in families, scientists have been trying to pinpoint genes involved in bipolar disorder. This was the largest genetic analysis of its kind on the disease, which affects an estimated 1 percent to 3 percent of adults worldwide, Craddock said. The brain disorder causes extreme shifts in mood, energy and ability to function. It is marked by high periods of elation or irritability and low periods of sadness and hopelessness that can last months. The proper function of brain neurons depends on a delicate equilibrium between sodium and calcium, the researchers said. ""The brain operates according to how quickly calcium and sodium are going in and out of cells and how much of it goes in and out,"" Craddock said. The findings suggest that bipolar disorder may stem at least in part from malfunctions in the flow of these ions, which are electrically charged versions of the chemicals. There is a need for better treatment, Craddock said. Lithium, the most common, helps only about two-thirds of those with the disorder and can cause drowsiness, weight gain and mild shakiness. The U.S. government's National Institutes of Health helped fund the research. Dr. Thomas Insel, director of the NIH's National Institute of Mental Health, said the findings may help solve the puzzle that is bipolar disorder. ""It's not going to tell us the whole story -- it doesn't give you the whole puzzle -- but it's something to build on,"" Insel said in a telephone interview. Craddock said identifying the two gene variants probably will not be helpful in determining an individual's risk for the disorder because many who do not have the disease will have the genes.

Bipolar disorder is one of the most difficult mental illnesses to diagnose and treat because of its complicated shifts between different symptoms. At the present time there is no cure for bipolar disorder but strategies such as medication and cognitive behavioral therapy to help minimize symptoms and manage the illness. However some researchers are looking for different methods that could use a more holistic approach to treating the disorder in the future. Mental illness often are closely related to issues in the brain that lead to certain mood problems and various behaviors. Medications are meant to help balance out chemicals in the brain that may be causing certain symptoms. However, researchers believe that helping to restore nerve cell health in the brain for better communication may go a long way to treat issues like bipolar disorder. In the past it was believed that bipolar disorder was caused by an imbalance of chemicals like serotonin or dopamine which led to depressed or elevated moods. Researchers now believe that neural plasticity may play a more important role in alleviated the symptoms of mania and depression. People with bipolar disorder tend to have atrophy of neurons in certain brain areas but improving nerve cells in these areas could potentially change the path of the disorder. Medications like lithium which are used in treating bipolar disorder were recently discovered to actually boost levels of proteins that help neurons maintain their function. This may explain why lithium has been shown to be effective as a long term treatment. Using other methods to improve the health of neurons in the brain may create a more focused and efficient way to reduce symptoms quickly. Although more research needs to be done to determine long term results, nerve and brain health may be the focus of bipolar treatment in the future.

Bipolar Disorder (cont.) In this Article
What are the risk factors for bipolar disorder? Scientists are learning about the possible causes of bipolar disorder. Most scientists agree that there is no single cause. Rather, many factors likely act together to produce the illness or increase risk. Bipolar disorder tends to run in families, so researchers are looking for genes that may increase a person's chance of developing the illness. Genes are the ""building blocks"" of heredity. They help control how the body and brain work and grow. Genes are contained inside a person's cells that are passed down from parents to children. Children with a parent or sibling who has bipolar disorder are four to six times more likely to develop the illness, compared with children who do not have a family history of bipolar disorder. However, most children with a family history of bipolar disorder will not develop the illness. Genetic research on bipolar disorder is being helped by advances in technology. This type of research is now much quicker and more far-reaching than in the past. One example is the launch of the Bipolar Disorder Phenome Database, funded in part by NIMH. Using the database, scientists will be able to link visible signs of the disorder with the genes that may influence them. So far, researchers using this database found that most people with bipolar disorder had:
The researchers also identified certain traits that appeared to run in families, including:
Scientists continue to study these traits, which may help them find the genes that cause bipolar disorder some day. But genes are not the only risk factor for bipolar disorder. Studies of identical twins have shown that the twin of a person with bipolar illness does not always develop the disorder. This is important because identical twins share all of the same genes. The study results suggest factors besides genes are also at work. Rather, it is likely that many different genes and a person's environment are involved. However, scientists do not yet fully understand how these factors interact to cause bipolar disorder. Brain structure and functioning
Brain-imaging studies are helping scientists learn what happens in the brain of a person with bipolar disorder. Newer brain-imaging tools, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), allow researchers to take pictures of the living brain at work. These tools help scientists study the brain's structure and activity. Some imaging studies show how the brains of people with bipolar disorder may differ from the brains of healthy people or people with other mental disorders. For example, one study using MRI found that the pattern of brain development in children with bipolar disorder was similar to that in children with ""multi-dimensional impairment,"" a disorder that causes symptoms that overlap somewhat with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. This suggests that the common pattern of brain development may be linked to general risk for unstable moods. Learning more about these differences, along with information gained from genetic studies, helps scientists better understand bipolar disorder. Someday scientists may be able to predict which types of treatment will work most effectively. They may even find ways to prevent bipolar disorder. How is bipolar disorder diagnosed? The first step in getting a proper diagnosis is to talk to a doctor, who may conduct a physical examination, an interview, and lab tests. Bipolar disorder cannot currently be identified through a blood test or a brain scan, but these tests can help rule out other contributing factors, such as a stroke or brain tumor. If the problems are not caused by other illnesses, the doctor may conduct a mental health evaluation. The doctor may also provide a referral to a trained mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist, who is experienced in diagnosing and treating bipolar disorder. The doctor or mental health professional should conduct a complete diagnostic evaluation. He or she should discuss any family history of bipolar disorder or other mental illnesses and get a complete history of symptoms. The doctor or mental health professionals should also talk to the person's close relatives or spouse and note how they describe the person's symptoms and family medical history. People with bipolar disorder are more likely to seek help when they are depressed than when experiencing mania or hypomania. Therefore, a careful medical history is needed to assure that bipolar disorder is not mistakenly diagnosed as major depressive disorder, which is also called unipolar depression.

2.8 percent of U.S adults live with bipolar disorder. Some of them have episodes several times a year; others experience them rarely. Attacks may last for days or weeks. Unfortunately, this condition has no cure. A common misconception is that this disorder is just about having mood swings. The truth is, it is a severe mental condition that can affect one’s quality of life. There is plenty to know about bipolar disorder, including available treatment options that help manage the bipolar disorder symptoms. What Is Bipolar Disorder? Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, and concentration. Everyone has ups and downs, but with bipolar disorder, these changes are severe. The changes range from episodes of extreme highs called mania to extreme lows called depression. Unlike ordinary mood swings, the mood changes of bipolar disorder are so intense that they may interfere with relationships, productivity at work, and daily activities. What Are the Causes and Triggers of Bipolar Disorder? There is no apparent cause of disorder bipolar. It results from a combination of genetic and environmental causes. Certain factors may trigger episodes in people who are predisposed to the condition. Is bipolar disorder hereditary? Yes, it is. You are more likely to develop this condition if someone in your immediate family has it. The risk is higher if either your parents or your twin has the disease. It is clear that more than one gene is involved. Researchers are yet to determine the particular genes responsible for the disorder. However, not everyone with an inherited vulnerability develops the disease. Therefore, genes are not the only cause. Abnormalities in Brain Structure and Functioning
Some studies indicate that the brain structure and functioning of people with bipolar disorder are different from that of people who have no mental illnesses. However, there is not enough information about these differences to inform diagnosis. Therefore, health care providers base their diagnosis on a patient’s symptoms and history rather than brain imaging. Research indicates that external factors can trigger episodes of mania or depression. Environmental influences may also make existing symptoms worse. Some of the most common environmental triggers are:
Stressful life events can trigger the disorder in someone with a genetic vulnerability. Such events involve drastic changes such as losing a loved one, going away to college, losing a job, or moving. Positive life events such as getting married can also trigger an episode. Substance abuse alone cannot cause bipolar disorder. However, it can trigger an episode or worsen the progression of symptoms. Drugs such as cocaine, amphetamines, or ecstasy can trigger mania. Alcohol can trigger depression. Manic episodes are expected during the summer. Depressive episodes are typical during fall, winter, and spring. Not getting enough sleep can trigger a manic episode. The quality of sleep is also essential. Restless nights can worsen symptoms and make extreme behavior more likely. What Are the Different Types of Bipolar Disorder? According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM), there are three main types of bipolar disorder based on the nature and severity of symptoms. It is the classic form of this disorder and was originally referred to as “manic depression.” One may experience a sudden, extreme shift in moods, and their behavior may escalate quickly. Individuals with this type of bipolar disorder experience episodes of severe mania. A diagnosis of bipolar I mean that you have experienced at least one manic episode that lasts longer than one week. 90% of people with this disorder also experience periods of depression. Without treatment, manic episodes last 3-6 months, and depressive episodes last 6-12 months. Individuals with this type of disorder experience a less severe form of mania called hypomania. A diagnosis of bipolar II means you often experience major depressive episode. Instead of mania, you experience a less extreme episode called hypomania. Hypomania often becomes worse without treatment and may result in severe mania or depression. Individuals with this type of disorder have symptoms that do not meet the diagnostic requirements for hypomania or depression. They experience mild symptoms that last for 1-2 years. What Are Signs and Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder? Bipolar disorder is typically diagnosed in late adolescence or early adulthood. Symptoms can appear in children, pregnant women, or after childbirth. A manic episode does not always turn someone into a maniac. In this state, a person may feel extreme highs and engage in risky .

Bipolar disorder usually begins in early adulthood, between eighteen and thirty years of age. The earlier symptoms appear, the more severe the illness tends to be. Bipolar disorder typically begins after a stressful life event, such as the death of a loved one, a divorce, or financial problems. Sometimes an illness, such as a physical injury or stroke, can trigger symptoms. Most people with bipolar disorder have at least one episode of depression, along with one or more episodes of mania. It’s important to seek treatment for bipolar disorder if you or someone you know has symptoms..
What is the main cause of bipolar disorder? Bipolar disorder is a brain disorder that causes extreme shifts in mood, energy, and activity levels. It occurs in 1-2% of the general population. There is strong evidence that genes play a role in causing depression and bipolar disorder. Many genes are involved in how the brain works. Studies show that an abnormality in the genes that control the brain chemical serotonin may be responsible for bipolar disorder in many patients..
Why are females so bipolar? There are several reasons behind this question. Some of the factors include nature and nurture. Females have biologically programmed mood swings. This is because they have to carry the baby for nine months and therefore are more sensitive. Males, on the other hand, are more on the aggressive side. This is also because of the different hormones present in the brain. Again, nurture is an important factor. Society disapprove of men showing their emotions and so, through a series of upbringing, boys are made to hide their feelings. When the society encourages the opposite in girls, the difference in behavior is natural..
What are the signs of bipolar in a woman? Hi , A woman who is suffering from bipolar disorder may show some of the following signs. -She may be in high spirits one moment and then her mood could suddenly change to being depressed. -She may not be able to sleep properly or at all. -She may be highly agitated, irritable and edgy. -She could have suicidal thoughts. And this list is not exhaustive. You may want to ask her to see a doctor..
How a person with bipolar thinks? The most significant feature of bipolar disorder is the presence of “mood episodes.” The symptoms of mania and depression can affect your ability to function normally. There are periods of time with completely normal moods in between episodes. It is difficult to predict when an episode will occur. Even if you have known the pattern of your symptoms in the past, it may change in the future..
How genetic is bipolar? It is important to remember that heredity only accounts for about 50% of the likelihood of developing bipolar disorder. There is no single gene responsible for the disorder, rather it appears to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.. Does Bipolar worsen with age? Bipolar disorder is not a normal part of aging. It is a mood disorder that occurs at any age. People with Bipolar disorder may experience periods of depression and periods of mania. Mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and birth control pills are some common medications that help treat bipolar disorder..
Are bipolar people smart? Bipolar people are often seen as moody, and many people think they are just lazy. But in truth, they have a very real, very serious illness called bipolar disorder. Bipolar people are often misunderstood, and they often suffer in silence. Bipolar disorder, also known as manic depression, is a brain disorder that causes unusual shifts in a person’s mood, energy, activity levels and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. It can be a devastating illness and if not treated, it can lead to the worst kind of f.
Do bipolar people hear voices? Yes, they do. Bipolar people often hear voices. Often they hear not just one voice, but several different ones. This is what’s called “hearing voices”. People with bipolar disorder are often misdiagnosed with schizophrenia, as the symptoms of both disorders may be quite similar. However, there are some major differences between the two. People with schizophrenia hear voices that are not there, that are completely made up by the patient’s delusional mind. This difference is the reason why people with bipolar disorder are often prescribed antidepressants to treat their symptoms, rather than antipsychotics..

We all experience a variety of moods such as happiness, sadness, and anger. Unpleasant moods and changes in mood are normal reactions in everyday life, and we can often identify the events that caused our mood to change. However, when we experience extreme mood changes that affect how we behave and function, these changes are often the result of a mood disorder. Bipolar disorder (formerly known as manic-depressive disorder) is a mood disorder that consists of periods of extremely elevated mood (mania), extremely low mood (depression), and normal mood. Bipolar disorder typically begins for people during adolescence and early adulthood. The most common onset is from the teenage years to the early 30s. It is unusual for bipolar disorder to begin in childhood without strong familial risk factors, and it is rare for its onset to occur after the age of 60 (unless it is associated with another medical condition). Bipolar disorder occurs in about 1% to 3% of the adult population, and men and women are affected equally. The rate of suicide for people with bipolar disorder is around 15 times higher than that of the general population. There is no single, proven cause of bipolar disorder, but research suggests that it is the result of abnormalities in the way some nerve cells in the brain function or communicate. Researchers also believe that there is a definite genetic link (family history) in which there is a higher risk for people who have a parent or full sibling (i.e., a first-degree relative) with bipolar disorder. Whatever the precise nature of the cause of bipolar disorder, it clearly makes people with the disorder more vulnerable to emotional and physical stresses. As a result, upsetting life experiences, alcohol, illicit drug use, lack of sleep, certain antidepressants, or other stresses can trigger episodes of illness, even though these stresses do not actually cause the disorder. Bipolar disorder is not the fault of the person suffering from it and is not the result of a ""weak"" or unstable personality. Rather, bipolar disorder is a treatable medical condition. Symptoms and Complications
Bipolar disorder is a condition in which the person's mood changes in cycles – from extremely high or irritable to extremely low and hopeless – over weeks to months. The nature of these mood changes varies from one person to the next. A person may go through periods of elevated mood, depressed mood, and times when mood is normal. The period of time that the extreme high and low moods are experienced are called episodes of mania and depression. It is less common for a person to alternate between mania and depression; in most, one or the other is predominant. Mania: During a manic episode, a person will experience a high, irritable, angry, or aggressive mood for at least one week that is not caused by drug abuse, medication, or other medical conditions. The person's mood disturbance will be severe enough to cause concerns from family or friends, and may warrant a hospital stay to prevent harm to self or other. In addition, they will experience 3 or more of the following:
- needing little sleep
- being more talkative than usual, often more loudly or quickly
- having racing thoughts (thoughts that won't quiet)
- being much more active than usual
- being distracted, often by unimportant or irrelevant stimuli
- having an inflated feeling of power, greatness, or importance (inflated self-esteem)
- doing reckless things without concern about possible consequences (e.g., spending too much money, engaging in inappropriate sexual activity, or making risky business investments)
A manic episode may also include psychotic symptoms such as delusions (firmly believing things that are not true) or hallucinations (hearing, feeling, or seeing things that are not there). A person going through a manic episode is unlikely to be able to keep up with important daily obligations, such as their job or schoolwork. Hypomania is a milder form of mania that has the same symptoms but less severe, and has less negative impact on a person's daily activities. Symptoms must last for at least 4 consecutive days. During a hypomanic episode, the person may have an elevated mood and be more productive, but the mood is uncharacteristic of the person's baseline personality. Because these episodes often feel good, the quest for hypomania may even cause some people with bipolar disorder to stop taking their medications.

A Light in the Dark: Breakthrough Insights on Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder
It is Time for a Global Reality Check! Since this author was a youngster, she closely studied biological, psychological conditions and profiling dysfunction such as mental disorder, abuse, addictions, domestic violence and criminal influences. For the entirety of her life, she has devoted significant efforts, study, observation to investigate the 'root causes' of such micro-psychological conditions that effectively manifest as more macro-sociological disorders in society and in our world. The culmination of this research and acute observances over the past 45 years is beginning to coalesce and certain insights can be gleaned that may offer treatment potential in intelligence and medical circles who may be equally invested in solving these mysteries of the mind and body. It is important to note, however, that there are certain parties that may not wish such mental conditions and disorders to be properly or effectively treated or even dare I say- cured. For there is significant employment, investments, systems, services, drugs and public policy that perpetually support it and parties who benefit from the generational cycles of illness, disease and disorder. It is true that psychiatric conditions or afflictions are the result of a combination of influences that are inherently genetic, environmental and causal. In fact, we currently all can suffer and be affected by biological and mental disorders. If you do not have a mental health condition of some sort, you may have a genetic predisposition to one and it is only a matter of a simple trigger be it an allergy, an infection, chemical exposure, a bacteria, a virus, a parasite or a trauma that can flick the switch on that gene and cause an expression or imbalance in your brain and body. If you have ever been ill, on antibiotics, vomited, overly fatigued, had lethargy, stressed, depressed, had stomach, intestinal or bowel issues, confusion or disorientation and insomnia or anxiety, sexual dysfunction or wasn't able to cope, you have experienced effects of a mental or a brain illness and most likely a biological infection. What many do not understand is that any affliction of the brain affects the body or vice versa. I must emphasize that the mind body and nuclear soul symbiotic health of a biological, psychological and neurological connected system is paramount to overall physical and mental health and well being. Few understand or treat the 'whole' organism. And that is what you are is..a complex organization of sybmbiotic cellular living bodies within an organism. And we as organisms are a macro-biological organizational system on this living planet we call, Mother Earth. Now I must comment that some organisms or persons' actions are more conducive to health while some are more conducive to disease while others are indifferent or ignorant. You do have a choice to be one of the above, in fact it is each and every person's responsibility to be a healthier organism and prevent disease and transmission with self-care and due diligence. I must express my frustration at the lack of personal self-care in western countries and the over use of biological warfare between nations that excessively exasperate and compound the issue causing pandemics leading to cycles of infections, the resurgence of diseases and social disorder that costs trillions in treatment, disable societies, judicial systems and medical services. There have been outright abuses and crimes by individuals, groups, corporations and nations using nuclear fusion of caustic and poisonous chemicals into items, crops, the food cycle and natural diets calling it voodoo, franken nutrition, treatment or witchcraft. But that is another article...let's get to the root causes. Schizophrenia is a genetic disease, cellular and mental disorder previously known as Multiple Personality Disorder. Go figure, they keep changing the disorder descriptions and renaming illnesses in the DSM manual of psychiatric disorders simply to confuse everyone. It is a disease of dysfunctional cellular processes that originates in the left side of the brain responsible for the most basic of logic, scientific thought, math, computations, memorization, recall and controls the right side of the body. This criss cross control functionality of the brain is referred to as X by some.

There are other mental disorders besides bipolar disorder, which can produce mood swings. For example, mood swings can be caused by general medical conditions or other physical illnesses that affect the body's regulatory systems. Suspect medical conditions include various brain chemical imbalances, hormone disorders (such as hyper- or hypothyroidism), bacterial or viral infections, and autoimmunity conditions (leading to body rhythm dysregulation). Such illnesses could cause people to experience bipolar-like mood swings even though they don't have actual bipolar disorder. See our section on Contemporary Understandings of Bipolar Disorder for a more detailed discussion of medical conditions, which must be ruled out prior to bipolar diagnosis. Equally confusing is the use of street drugs and/or alcohol, which can lead to altered mood states. Intoxication with central nervous system stimulant drugs (such as Cocaine, or Methamphetamine) can easily mimic a manic state. Similarly, intoxication with central nervous system depressant drugs (such as alcohol, or Valium) can mimic a depressive state. When it is not clear if a mood condition is due to a drug or to a disease process, doctors will tend to hold off making definitive bipolar diagnoses until enough time has passed so as to allow any drug effect that might be affecting mood to metabolize and clear out of the affected person's system. As previously mentioned, manic people tend to show poor judgment and to be pleasure-seeking in the extreme. For this reason, it is not at all uncommon for people in the midst of a manic disorder episode to take drugs and/or drink alcohol. Similarly, people experiencing a depressive episode tend to feel awful, and sometimes will ""self-medicate"" with street drugs and/or alcohol in an attempt to help themselves feel better. . Though some short-term relief may be gained by such self-medication attempts, substance abuse and addiction problems can result in the long-term, which compounds the existing mental disorder. Addicts, of course, are at the mercy of the availability of their drugs; they may develop manic depressive mood symptoms as a result of withdrawal symptoms, or efforts to ward off experiencing withdrawal symptoms. When either of these situations occur, you have a situation where a true bipolar condition and drug effects may exist simultaneously. Once again, this sort of situation can be ruled out by a diagnosing doctor by simply letting enough time pass for the effects of any drugs or alcohol to wear off. There is perhaps a weak bi-directional causal relationship between substance abuse disorders and bipolar disorder. People who have bipolar affective disorder have an increased risk for developing substance abuse problems, and people who use substances may help to release whatever inborn potential or vulnerability they may have for developing bipolar disorder (see our section on the Diathesis-Stress Hypothesis for more detail). Whatever the true relationship is between bipolar conditions and substance abuse, it is not in question that the combination of the two conditions leaves people worse off than either alone. Complicating bipolar diagnosis further is the possibility that an individual with mood swings is suffering from a mental illness other than bipolar disorder. A number of other mental disorders are associated with mood swings. Mental disorders which may be commonly confused with bipolar disorder include Borderline Personality Disorder , Schizoaffective Disorder, Unipolar Depression, and Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder.","[{'passage': '""Can I see the test results, please?"" Let’s start with a true story. A colleague of mine in the US heard that her grandson had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital. As a long-standing critic of the psychiatric system she was concerned for his welfare and went to see him. She discovered that in the first few days he had been drugged into a stupor and she insisted on seeing the medical staff. Three psychiatrists told her that, sadly, her grandson had a bipolar disorder caused by a brain bio-chemical imbalance. Quietly, but firmly, she asked what evidence they had there was something wrong with his brain. They said that his mood and behaviour indicated a serious problem. She asked how they knew this problem was caused by brain biochemistry. Slightly uncomfortable, they vaguely referred to studies that indicated that this was the case. Much more confident now, my colleague responded that she knew of no studies that had ever confirmed this idea even though it is a common assumption in the psychiatric world. For good measure she quoted some studies that indicated that there was nothing wrong with the brains of people with all sorts of psychiatric labels. Sensing that they were dealing with someone who might actually have read the literature they asked what she wanted. Her grandson was quickly transferred to a unit offering talking therapies. My colleague didn’t ask the question that all patients, relatives and advocates should ask when confronted with the claim that a brain biochemical problem lies at the root of someone’s low mood or strange behaviour. She could have said, ""Can I see the test results, please?"" The truth is that, unlike all other branches of medicine, psychiatrists do not do physical tests on people to confirm their diagnoses. The reason is simple: there is nothing wrong with the brains of people diagnosed schizophrenic, bi-polar, depressed and so on. The organic hypothesis remains just that; an unproven hypothesis. Claims continue to be made in the scientific literature and popular press. David Cohen, another US activist, has noted that almost all the substances operating within the human body have been investigated as a possible cause of schizophrenia. This research is leaked to the press before it has been accepted in a peer-reviewed journal and ""the results are likely to be cited around the world, thought they may never make it to scientific publication"". We are also well aware of the massive conflicts of interest involved in the studies that do finally appear in the official literature. Effective Health Care, in reviewing the newest so-called anti-psychotic medication concluded, ""Most relevant trials are undertaken by those with clear pecuniary interest in the results""1. There is no validity in psychiatric diagnosis2,3. Even if there were, after almost two hundred years, we have never found anything at all wrong with the brain biochemistry of people diagnosed with a host of so-called disorders. Some, conditions, for example, Alcohol-induced dementia do indeed show real signs of brain damage. This is rare. The studies on all the main diagnostic categories of psychiatry, however, are plagued by a significant problem: the people being tested have almost always already received psychotropic medication. In other words, if there is a blood, brain or liver disorder, this may well have been caused by the drugs, or ECT. Physical tests on people diagnosed, but not yet treated, by psychiatrists, would be the only way to find out if there really were a difference between these people and the general public. This never happens as most people first encounter a GP who, instead of asking for blood and other tests to demonstrate a psychiatric condition, simply prescribe a psychotropic drug or refer on to a psychiatrist. Imagine the same situation in oncology. You are told that you look like you have cancer. There are no tests offered to you. You are told you will have two operations, followed by radiotherapy and a course of drugs that makes your hair fall out. The idea is preposterous. You demand proof of your condition. An x-ray, a CT scan and blood and liver tests reveal that the diagnosis was accurate. Reassured, though still very scared you agree to the treatment. Psychiatrists of course do ask for tests like CT scans on their patients but these are to exclude the possibility of organic damage. In other words, they are checking to see if there is a real brain problem, evidence of illegal drug-use or whatever.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:b122e79e-187d-4e58-bfa1-2f2d3c4a1023>']}, {'passage': 'Have you ever stopped to think about how the mental health stigma doesn’t make sense? So many of us walk around feeling ashamed of our struggles, trying to hide them from the rest of the world. Yet functioning with these immense internal difficulties actually evinces our strength! As actress Carrie Fisher wrote in Wishful Drinking:\n“Being bipolar can be an all-consuming challenge, requiring a lot of stamina and even more courage, so if you’re living with this illness and functioning at all, it’s something to be proud of, not ashamed of.”\nPlus, try this statistic on for size: according to the CDC, nearly 50% of U.S. adults will struggle with at least one mental illness in their lifetime. In this post, we’ll focus on the dual diagnosis of addiction and bipolar disorder. What Is Bipolar Disorder? Bipolar is a mood disorder characterized by emotional swings from high to low. People with bipolar deal with depressive “down” phases and manic “up” phases, and they struggle to find a healthy middle ground. In a depressive state, a person might be immobilized, unable to take care of their usual responsibilities. But in a manic state, that same person might work around the clock. One quick definition for bipolar is “experiencing extremes”. This disorder does have a genetic component, but an individual’s environment matters a great deal as well. Growing up in a physically, mentally, or emotionally traumatic environment is a strong risk factor. Why an Accurate Diagnosis Can Be Difficult\nHere are a few key reasons why bipolar disorder can be difficult to diagnose accurately:\nFirst, if a person is under the influence, it’s extremely challenging to provide an accurate diagnosis. Having people detox prior to diagnosis is ideal. Next, the bipolar label has increased in popularity in recent years. This is great for awareness, but it can also lead to misdiagnosis. For example, sometimes people who are dealing with clinical depression are misdiagnosed with bipolar because of the dramatic difference between their low-functioning depressive state and their usual functioning state. Similarly, rigid, black-and-white thinking can be confused with bipolar symptoms, and so can the aftereffects of trauma. Finally, when people have a great deal of conflict in their lives, they may be labeled as bipolar. But when they gain the tools they need to resolve those conflicts, often the level of internal tension changes significantly. In short, understanding bipolar disorder and addiction is critical for accurate diagnosis and treatment. True bipolar disorder involves an imbalance in brain chemistry, and it’s certainly a serious condition. Yet in our experience in running a residential addiction treatment center, we see people misdiagnosed as bipolar when in reality they have mental and emotional issues causing a lot of upset in their lives. That’s not brain chemistry; that’s just upset. We find that when such people heal those issues, the upset in their lives decreases dramatically. The Connection Between Addiction and Bipolar Disorder\nBipolar disorder is part of a family of mood disorders, including depression, anxiety, and seasonal affective disorder (SAD). While mood disorders can be caused or exacerbated by drug use, more often people with mood disorders use addictive substances to self-medicate. Many people with bipolar turn to substances during their depressive states. There is a particularly strong connection between bipolar and addiction. Statistics from DualDiagnosis.org suggest that 56% of people with bipolar disorder have experienced drug addiction. Healing from Bipolar and Addiction\nSeptember is National Recovery Month, and it’s also Self Awareness Month. This is fitting, as you can’t really have one without the other. Self awareness is an essential component of recovery, especially when you’re dealing with a dual diagnosis. That said, medication certainly has its place as well. If you find that you continue to struggle with emotional extremes after you’ve detoxed from substances, then medication may give you the support you need to maintain emotional stability. However, don’t shortchange yourself by skipping over the mental and emotional issues that contribute to mood disorders. Finding and addressing the root causes of physical disorders can minimize (or eliminate!) the need for medications to treat symptoms, and the same is true for emotional disorders. What Counseling Strategies Work Well with Bipolar?', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:5c7583b3-6008-4826-94b2-344919b5d180>']}, {'passage': 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two genes that influence the activity of nerve cells in the brain may play a key role in a person\'s risk for bipolar disorder, marked by dramatic swings from depression to manic behavior, researchers said on Sunday. The findings are not expected to lead to a genetic test for the risk of the condition but could help unravel the mystery of how it arises and lead to better treatments, they reported in the journal Nature Genetics. An international team of scientists examined the genomes of 10,596 people mainly from Britain and the United States, including 4,387 with bipolar disorder, also sometimes known as manic-depression. The researchers found those with bipolar disorder more likely to have certain variants of the ANK3 and CACNA1C genes. Proteins made by the two genes help govern the flow of sodium and calcium ions into and out of neurons in the brain, influencing the activity of these nerve cells. ""The key importance of this is that it gives us a clear idea of the sorts of chemicals and mechanisms in the brain that are involved in bipolar disorder,"" Nick Craddock of Britain\'s Cardiff University, who helped lead the study, said in a telephone interview. ""Over a number of years, that will help researchers to develop better approaches to diagnosis and treatment."" Because it tends to run in families, scientists have been trying to pinpoint genes involved in bipolar disorder. This was the largest genetic analysis of its kind on the disease, which affects an estimated 1 percent to 3 percent of adults worldwide, Craddock said. The brain disorder causes extreme shifts in mood, energy and ability to function. It is marked by high periods of elation or irritability and low periods of sadness and hopelessness that can last months. The proper function of brain neurons depends on a delicate equilibrium between sodium and calcium, the researchers said. ""The brain operates according to how quickly calcium and sodium are going in and out of cells and how much of it goes in and out,"" Craddock said. The findings suggest that bipolar disorder may stem at least in part from malfunctions in the flow of these ions, which are electrically charged versions of the chemicals. There is a need for better treatment, Craddock said. Lithium, the most common, helps only about two-thirds of those with the disorder and can cause drowsiness, weight gain and mild shakiness. The U.S. government\'s National Institutes of Health helped fund the research. Dr. Thomas Insel, director of the NIH\'s National Institute of Mental Health, said the findings may help solve the puzzle that is bipolar disorder. ""It\'s not going to tell us the whole story -- it doesn\'t give you the whole puzzle -- but it\'s something to build on,"" Insel said in a telephone interview. Craddock said identifying the two gene variants probably will not be helpful in determining an individual\'s risk for the disorder because many who do not have the disease will have the genes.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:5ae6729d-06bc-4f01-bc7b-0b81db567919>']}, {'passage': 'Bipolar disorder is one of the most difficult mental illnesses to diagnose and treat because of its complicated shifts between different symptoms. At the present time there is no cure for bipolar disorder but strategies such as medication and cognitive behavioral therapy to help minimize symptoms and manage the illness. However some researchers are looking for different methods that could use a more holistic approach to treating the disorder in the future. Mental illness often are closely related to issues in the brain that lead to certain mood problems and various behaviors. Medications are meant to help balance out chemicals in the brain that may be causing certain symptoms. However, researchers believe that helping to restore nerve cell health in the brain for better communication may go a long way to treat issues like bipolar disorder. In the past it was believed that bipolar disorder was caused by an imbalance of chemicals like serotonin or dopamine which led to depressed or elevated moods. Researchers now believe that neural plasticity may play a more important role in alleviated the symptoms of mania and depression. People with bipolar disorder tend to have atrophy of neurons in certain brain areas but improving nerve cells in these areas could potentially change the path of the disorder. Medications like lithium which are used in treating bipolar disorder were recently discovered to actually boost levels of proteins that help neurons maintain their function. This may explain why lithium has been shown to be effective as a long term treatment. Using other methods to improve the health of neurons in the brain may create a more focused and efficient way to reduce symptoms quickly. Although more research needs to be done to determine long term results, nerve and brain health may be the focus of bipolar treatment in the future.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:20e044c2-af29-4922-89b1-b0ccc357332a>']}, {'passage': 'Bipolar Disorder (cont.) In this Article\nWhat are the risk factors for bipolar disorder? Scientists are learning about the possible causes of bipolar disorder. Most scientists agree that there is no single cause. Rather, many factors likely act together to produce the illness or increase risk. Bipolar disorder tends to run in families, so researchers are looking for genes that may increase a person\'s chance of developing the illness. Genes are the ""building blocks"" of heredity. They help control how the body and brain work and grow. Genes are contained inside a person\'s cells that are passed down from parents to children. Children with a parent or sibling who has bipolar disorder are four to six times more likely to develop the illness, compared with children who do not have a family history of bipolar disorder. However, most children with a family history of bipolar disorder will not develop the illness. Genetic research on bipolar disorder is being helped by advances in technology. This type of research is now much quicker and more far-reaching than in the past. One example is the launch of the Bipolar Disorder Phenome Database, funded in part by NIMH. Using the database, scientists will be able to link visible signs of the disorder with the genes that may influence them. So far, researchers using this database found that most people with bipolar disorder had:\nThe researchers also identified certain traits that appeared to run in families, including:\nScientists continue to study these traits, which may help them find the genes that cause bipolar disorder some day. But genes are not the only risk factor for bipolar disorder. Studies of identical twins have shown that the twin of a person with bipolar illness does not always develop the disorder. This is important because identical twins share all of the same genes. The study results suggest factors besides genes are also at work. Rather, it is likely that many different genes and a person\'s environment are involved. However, scientists do not yet fully understand how these factors interact to cause bipolar disorder. Brain structure and functioning\nBrain-imaging studies are helping scientists learn what happens in the brain of a person with bipolar disorder. Newer brain-imaging tools, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), allow researchers to take pictures of the living brain at work. These tools help scientists study the brain\'s structure and activity. Some imaging studies show how the brains of people with bipolar disorder may differ from the brains of healthy people or people with other mental disorders. For example, one study using MRI found that the pattern of brain development in children with bipolar disorder was similar to that in children with ""multi-dimensional impairment,"" a disorder that causes symptoms that overlap somewhat with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. This suggests that the common pattern of brain development may be linked to general risk for unstable moods. Learning more about these differences, along with information gained from genetic studies, helps scientists better understand bipolar disorder. Someday scientists may be able to predict which types of treatment will work most effectively. They may even find ways to prevent bipolar disorder. How is bipolar disorder diagnosed? The first step in getting a proper diagnosis is to talk to a doctor, who may conduct a physical examination, an interview, and lab tests. Bipolar disorder cannot currently be identified through a blood test or a brain scan, but these tests can help rule out other contributing factors, such as a stroke or brain tumor. If the problems are not caused by other illnesses, the doctor may conduct a mental health evaluation. The doctor may also provide a referral to a trained mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist, who is experienced in diagnosing and treating bipolar disorder. The doctor or mental health professional should conduct a complete diagnostic evaluation. He or she should discuss any family history of bipolar disorder or other mental illnesses and get a complete history of symptoms. The doctor or mental health professionals should also talk to the person\'s close relatives or spouse and note how they describe the person\'s symptoms and family medical history. People with bipolar disorder are more likely to seek help when they are depressed than when experiencing mania or hypomania. Therefore, a careful medical history is needed to assure that bipolar disorder is not mistakenly diagnosed as major depressive disorder, which is also called unipolar depression.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:83a19198-4d7a-4dd9-b850-5ad97b6a05ea>']}, {'passage': '2.8 percent of U.S adults live with bipolar disorder. Some of them have episodes several times a year; others experience them rarely. Attacks may last for days or weeks. Unfortunately, this condition has no cure. A common misconception is that this disorder is just about having mood swings. The truth is, it is a severe mental condition that can affect one’s quality of life. There is plenty to know about bipolar disorder, including available treatment options that help manage the bipolar disorder symptoms. What Is Bipolar Disorder? Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, and concentration. Everyone has ups and downs, but with bipolar disorder, these changes are severe. The changes range from episodes of extreme highs called mania to extreme lows called depression. Unlike ordinary mood swings, the mood changes of bipolar disorder are so intense that they may interfere with relationships, productivity at work, and daily activities. What Are the Causes and Triggers of Bipolar Disorder? There is no apparent cause of disorder bipolar. It results from a combination of genetic and environmental causes. Certain factors may trigger episodes in people who are predisposed to the condition. Is bipolar disorder hereditary? Yes, it is. You are more likely to develop this condition if someone in your immediate family has it. The risk is higher if either your parents or your twin has the disease. It is clear that more than one gene is involved. Researchers are yet to determine the particular genes responsible for the disorder. However, not everyone with an inherited vulnerability develops the disease. Therefore, genes are not the only cause. Abnormalities in Brain Structure and Functioning\nSome studies indicate that the brain structure and functioning of people with bipolar disorder are different from that of people who have no mental illnesses. However, there is not enough information about these differences to inform diagnosis. Therefore, health care providers base their diagnosis on a patient’s symptoms and history rather than brain imaging. Research indicates that external factors can trigger episodes of mania or depression. Environmental influences may also make existing symptoms worse. Some of the most common environmental triggers are:\nStressful life events can trigger the disorder in someone with a genetic vulnerability. Such events involve drastic changes such as losing a loved one, going away to college, losing a job, or moving. Positive life events such as getting married can also trigger an episode. Substance abuse alone cannot cause bipolar disorder. However, it can trigger an episode or worsen the progression of symptoms. Drugs such as cocaine, amphetamines, or ecstasy can trigger mania. Alcohol can trigger depression. Manic episodes are expected during the summer. Depressive episodes are typical during fall, winter, and spring. Not getting enough sleep can trigger a manic episode. The quality of sleep is also essential. Restless nights can worsen symptoms and make extreme behavior more likely. What Are the Different Types of Bipolar Disorder? According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM), there are three main types of bipolar disorder based on the nature and severity of symptoms. It is the classic form of this disorder and was originally referred to as “manic depression.” One may experience a sudden, extreme shift in moods, and their behavior may escalate quickly. Individuals with this type of bipolar disorder experience episodes of severe mania. A diagnosis of bipolar I mean that you have experienced at least one manic episode that lasts longer than one week. 90% of people with this disorder also experience periods of depression. Without treatment, manic episodes last 3-6 months, and depressive episodes last 6-12 months. Individuals with this type of disorder experience a less severe form of mania called hypomania. A diagnosis of bipolar II means you often experience major depressive episode. Instead of mania, you experience a less extreme episode called hypomania. Hypomania often becomes worse without treatment and may result in severe mania or depression. Individuals with this type of disorder have symptoms that do not meet the diagnostic requirements for hypomania or depression. They experience mild symptoms that last for 1-2 years. What Are Signs and Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder? Bipolar disorder is typically diagnosed in late adolescence or early adulthood. Symptoms can appear in children, pregnant women, or after childbirth.

Bipolar disorder is a brain disorder that causes extreme shifts in mood, energy, and activity levels. It occurs in 1-2% of the general population. There is strong evidence that genes play a role in causing depression and bipolar disorder. Many genes are involved in how the brain works. Studies show that an abnormality in the genes that control the brain chemical serotonin may be responsible for bipolar disorder in many patients..\nWhy are females so bipolar? There are several reasons behind this question. Some of the factors include nature and nurture. Females have biologically programmed mood swings. This is because they have to carry the baby for nine months and therefore are more sensitive. Males, on the other hand, are more on the aggressive side. This is also because of the different hormones present in the brain. Again, nurture is an important factor.

People with schizophrenia hear voices that are not there, that are completely made up by the patient’s delusional mind.

Unpleasant moods and changes in mood are normal reactions in everyday life, and we can often identify the events that caused our mood to change. However, when we experience extreme mood changes that affect how we behave and function, these changes are often the result of a mood disorder. Bipolar disorder (formerly known as manic-depressive disorder) is a mood disorder that consists of periods of extremely elevated mood (mania), extremely low mood (depression), and normal mood. Bipolar disorder typically begins for people during adolescence and early adulthood. The most common onset is from the teenage years to the early 30s. It is unusual for bipolar disorder to begin in childhood without strong familial risk factors, and it is rare for its onset to occur after the age of 60 (unless it is associated with another medical condition). Bipolar disorder occurs in about 1% to 3% of the adult population, and men and women are affected equally. The rate of suicide for people with bipolar disorder is around 15 times higher than that of the general population. There is no single, proven cause of bipolar disorder, but research suggests that it is the result of abnormalities in the way some nerve cells in the brain function or communicate. Researchers also believe that there is a definite genetic link (family history) in which there is a higher risk for people who have a parent or full sibling (i.e., a first-degree relative) with bipolar disorder. Whatever the precise nature of the cause of bipolar disorder, it clearly makes people with the disorder more vulnerable to emotional and physical stresses. As a result, upsetting life experiences, alcohol, illicit drug use, lack of sleep, certain antidepressants, or other stresses can trigger episodes of illness, even though these stresses do not actually cause the disorder. Bipolar disorder is not the fault of the person suffering from it and is not the result of a ""weak"" or unstable personality. Rather, bipolar disorder is a treatable medical condition. Symptoms and Complications\nBipolar disorder is a condition in which the person\'s mood changes in cycles – from extremely high or irritable to extremely low and hopeless – over weeks to months. The nature of these mood changes varies from one person to the next. A person may go through periods of elevated mood, depressed mood, and times when mood is normal. The period of time that the extreme high and low moods are experienced are called episodes of mania and depression. It is less common for a person to alternate between mania and depression; in most, one or the other is predominant. Mania: During a manic episode, a person will experience a high, irritable, angry, or aggressive mood for at least one week that is not caused by drug abuse, medication, or other medical conditions. The person\'s mood disturbance will be severe enough to cause concerns from family or friends, and may warrant a hospital stay to prevent harm to self or other. In addition, they will experience 3 or more of the following:\n- needing little sleep\n- being more talkative than usual, often more loudly or quickly\n- having racing thoughts (thoughts that won\'t quiet)\n- being much more active than usual\n- being distracted, often by unimportant or irrelevant stimuli\n- having an inflated feeling of power, greatness, or importance (inflated self-esteem)\n- doing reckless things without concern about possible consequences (e.g., spending too much money, engaging in inappropriate sexual activity, or making risky business investments)\nA manic episode may also include psychotic symptoms such as delusions (firmly believing things that are not true) or hallucinations (hearing, feeling, or seeing things that are not there). A person going through a manic episode is unlikely to be able to keep up with important daily obligations, such as their job or schoolwork. Hypomania is a milder form of mania that has the same symptoms but less severe, and has less negative impact on a person\'s daily activities. Symptoms must last for at least 4 consecutive days. During a hypomanic episode, the person may have an elevated mood and be more productive, but the mood is uncharacteristic of the person\'s baseline personality. Because these episodes often feel good, the quest for hypomania may even cause some people with bipolar disorder to stop taking their medications.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:f689f908-3741-4a60-b398-829a1a7f9ff9>']}, {'passage': ""- Education and Science»\n- Psychology & Psychiatry\nA Light in the Dark: Breakthrough Insights on Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder\nIt is Time for a Global Reality Check! Since this author was a youngster, she closely studied biological, psychological conditions and profiling dysfunction such as mental disorder, abuse, addictions, domestic violence and criminal influences. For the entirety of her life, she has devoted significant efforts, study, observation to investigate the 'root causes' of such micro-psychological conditions that effectively manifest as more macro-sociological disorders in society and in our world. The culmination of this research and acute observances over the past 45 years is beginning to coalesce and certain insights can be gleaned that may offer treatment potential in intelligence and medical circles who may be equally invested in solving these mysteries of the mind and body. It is important to note, however, that there are certain parties that may not wish such mental conditions and disorders to be properly or effectively treated or even dare I say- cured. For there is significant employment, investments, systems, services, drugs and public policy that perpetually support it and parties who benefit from the generational cycles of illness, disease and disorder. It is true that psychiatric conditions or afflictions are the result of a combination of influences that are inherently genetic, environmental and causal. In fact, we currently all can suffer and be affected by biological and mental disorders. If you do not have a mental health condition of some sort, you may have a genetic predisposition to one and it is only a matter of a simple trigger be it an allergy, an infection, chemical exposure, a bacteria, a virus, a parasite or a trauma that can flick the switch on that gene and cause an expression or imbalance in your brain and body. If you have ever been ill, on antibiotics, vomited, overly fatigued, had lethargy, stressed, depressed, had stomach, intestinal or bowel issues, confusion or disorientation and insomnia or anxiety, sexual dysfunction or wasn't able to cope, you have experienced effects of a mental or a brain illness and most likely a biological infection. What many do not understand is that any affliction of the brain affects the body or vice versa. I must emphasize that the mind body and nuclear soul symbiotic health of a biological, psychological and neurological connected system is paramount to overall physical and mental health and well being. Few understand or treat the 'whole' organism. And that is what you are is..a complex organization of sybmbiotic cellular living bodies within an organism. And we as organisms are a macro-biological organizational system on this living planet we call, Mother Earth. Now I must comment that some organisms or persons' actions are more conducive to health while some are more conducive to disease while others are indifferent or ignorant. You do have a choice to be one of the above, in fact it is each and every person's responsibility to be a healthier organism and prevent disease and transmission with self-care and due diligence. I must express my frustration at the lack of personal self-care in western countries and the over use of biological warfare between nations that excessively exasperate and compound the issue causing pandemics leading to cycles of infections, the resurgence of diseases and social disorder that costs trillions in treatment, disable societies, judicial systems and medical services. There have been outright abuses and crimes by individuals, groups, corporations and nations using nuclear fusion of caustic and poisonous chemicals into items, crops, the food cycle and natural diets calling it voodoo, franken nutrition, treatment or witchcraft. But that is another article...let's get to the root causes. Schizophrenia is a genetic disease, cellular and mental disorder previously known as Multiple Personality Disorder. Go figure, they keep changing the disorder descriptions and renaming illnesses in the DSM manual of psychiatric disorders simply to confuse everyone. It is a disease of dysfunctional cellular processes that originates in the left side of the brain responsible for the most basic of logic, scientific thought, math, computations, memorization, recall and controls the right side of the body. This criss cross control functionality of the brain is referred to as X by some."", 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:1fbb1387-a898-4870-a096-48e12b5ff14a>']}, {'passage': 'There are other mental disorders besides bipolar disorder, which can produce mood swings. For example, mood swings can be caused by general medical conditions or other physical illnesses that affect the body\'s regulatory systems. Suspect medical conditions include various brain chemical imbalances, hormone disorders (such as hyper- or hypothyroidism), bacterial or viral infections, and autoimmunity conditions (leading to body rhythm dysregulation). Such illnesses could cause people to experience bipolar-like mood swings even though they don\'t have actual bipolar disorder. See our section on Contemporary Understandings of Bipolar Disorder for a more detailed discussion of medical conditions, which must be ruled out prior to bipolar diagnosis. Equally confusing is the use of street drugs and/or alcohol, which can lead to altered mood states. Intoxication with central nervous system stimulant drugs (such as Cocaine, or Methamphetamine) can easily mimic a manic state. Similarly, intoxication with central nervous system depressant drugs (such as alcohol, or Valium) can mimic a depressive state. When it is not clear if a mood condition is due to a drug or to a disease process, doctors will tend to hold off making definitive bipolar diagnoses until enough time has passed so as to allow any drug effect that might be affecting mood to metabolize and clear out of the affected person\'s system. As previously mentioned, manic people tend to show poor judgment and to be pleasure-seeking in the extreme. For this reason, it is not at all uncommon for people in the midst of a manic disorder episode to take drugs and/or drink alcohol. Similarly, people experiencing a depressive episode tend to feel awful, and sometimes will ""self-medicate"" with street drugs and/or alcohol in an attempt to help themselves feel better. . Though some short-term relief may be gained by such self-medication attempts, substance abuse and addiction problems can result in the long-term, which compounds the existing mental disorder. Addicts, of course, are at the mercy of the availability of their drugs; they may develop manic depressive mood symptoms as a result of withdrawal symptoms, or efforts to ward off experiencing withdrawal symptoms. When either of these situations occur, you have a situation where a true bipolar condition and drug effects may exist simultaneously. Once again, this sort of situation can be ruled out by a diagnosing doctor by simply letting enough time pass for the effects of any drugs or alcohol to wear off. There is perhaps a weak bi-directional causal relationship between substance abuse disorders and bipolar disorder. People who have bipolar affective disorder have an increased risk for developing substance abuse problems, and people who use substances may help to release whatever inborn potential or vulnerability they may have for developing bipolar disorder (see our section on the Diathesis-Stress Hypothesis for more detail). Whatever the true relationship is between bipolar conditions and substance abuse, it is not in question that the combination of the two conditions leaves people worse off than either alone. Complicating bipolar diagnosis further is the possibility that an individual with mood swings is suffering from a mental illness other than bipolar disorder. A number of other mental disorders are associated with mood swings. Mental disorders which may be commonly confused with bipolar disorder include Borderline Personality Disorder , Schizoaffective Disorder, Unipolar Depression, and Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:1edce292-ebeb-4980-b4fc-a0a21d967143>']}]","{

                ""text"": ""Researchers are constantly hunting for chemical variations in people with emotional/behavioral problems. But even if chemical differences are someday found in those with such problems, why would we assume that these chemical processes cause their abnormal behaviors or moods, as opposed to being mere correlates of them at the chemical level? Doesn\u2019t every mood, thought, and behavior, whether normal or abnormal, have to have its own unique corresponding chemical correlate? After all, we are made of nothing but chemicals. Every feeling, thought, or behavior is merely a series of chemical processes. Such processes are the physiology, or means by which all bodily functions occur. Pathophysiology is the study of changes in the way bodies work, as a result of disease. These changes are the effects, not the causes, of diseases. Despite this, biological psychiatrists claim that finding the necessarily-present underlying chemical processes of abnormal moods, thoughts, or behaviors will prove that they are chemically caused. They are confusing how with why, or physiology with etiology. But its chemical correlate does not cause it; it merely is the mood, thought, or action, as viewed at the chemical level. They are one and the same thing. The chemical imbalance theory, in proposing that something causes itself to occur, thus makes no sense. It would be like finding the speeding up of water molecules to be the mechanism of water boiling, and then deducing that this process is the cause of its boiling. It is actually heat that makes water boil, by causing its molecules to accelerate. For example, if we get upset over losing someone, of course some chemical (neurotransmitter) process must occur, which corresponds to our feeling upset \u2014 this process is our upset feeling, as seen at the chemical level. But the cause of the emotion cannot be itself (its correlating chemical brain activity) \u2014 the cause is our loss. Similarly, if I choose to raise my arm, this elicits chemical processes in my muscles involving calcium, acetylcholine, and proteins. These processes are the means by which the arm movement operates, not its cause. They are the movement, as viewed at the chemical level. My voluntarily raising my arm is what made it move. Or if someone hits you on the head, this can cause impaired cognitive functioning, by altering brain cell levels of chemicals like potassium, glucose, and calcium, disrupting brain cell functioning. But this correlating change in chemical activity is not the cause of the impaired cognition; it is the impaired cognition, as seen at the chemical level. It is how, not why, the cognitive impairment occurred. The why, or cause of the abnormal cognition, and its correlating abnormal chemical activity, was being hit on the head. Imagine if police stopped looking for killers whenever they found the chemical correlates of an injury, due to wrongly assuming that the chemical abnormalities occurred spontaneously, killing the person. They would deduce that \u201cThe case has now been solved; it was biochemical.\u201d Such illogical conclusions would lead to a big rise in the murder rate once potential murderers realized they will not be sought after or arrested. Similarly, people\u2019s acceptance of the chemical correlates of problems to be their causes prevents them from looking for and addressing their true causes. Others claim that finding unusual brain activity in those with emotional/behavioral issues would explain what caused their problem. But abnormal brain activity and abnormal mental functioning are just two different ways of viewing the same event. Brain activity is the mechanism by which all thoughts, feelings, and behaviors occur, as seen at the brain cell functioning level. Of course something correspondingly occurs in our brains every time we think, feel, or act. And of course, each unique thought, feeling or action, whether normal or unusual, must have its own correlating unique brain process. They are the same thing, and something can\u2019t cause itself to occur. So even if such necessarily-present brain activity correlates are someday found in people with emotional problems, this won\u2019t explain why their problems developed. It will merely be a way to view how their brains work (what the physiological mechanisms of their feelings, thoughts, or actions are)."",

                ""text"": ""What Does NOT Cause Bipolar Disorder\nI receive so many emails and phone calls from people confused about what causes bipolar disorder. At least once every few weeks, someone contacts me wondering if the bipolar experienced by their loved one or themselves is the result of someone placing a curse on them. Although people who have untreated, unmanaged bipolar disorder may feel cursed, this is NOT a cause of the disorder. Below are a few of the other things that people may think cause bipolar disorder but, in fact, do not. Some may cause a person that already had bipolar disorder to exhibit symptoms, but these are not causes of the disorder. Physical, mental, or sexual abuse: Bipolar disorder is not the result of abuse. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder or an anxiety disorder may be the result of abuse but bipolar is not. However, if a person has undiagnosed bipolar disorder, or even if a person has well-managed bipolar disorder, abuse can certainly be a stress-related trigger for an episode. Too much/too little attention/attention seeking: If a person receives too much or too little attention, whether as a child or adult, this is NOT a cause of bipolar disorder. The person with bipolar is not using it to seek attention; this is NOT the cause of the disorder. Stress: It is often believed that a person that is under stress 'gets' bipolar disorder. Stress is a major trigger for bipolar episodes and symptoms. It is not the CAUSE; it is only a trigger for an existing disorder to come to light. Drug or alcohol abuse: It is a very common misconception that substance abuse causes bipolar disorder. This is because a person that has bipolar and is also abusing substances can exhibit symptoms and episodes as a result of the mental confusion caused by substance abuse. But the substance abuse is NOT the cause of their bipolar disorder. Birth Order: It doesn't matter if a person is the eldest child, middle child, youngest child or an only child. If they have bipolar disorder, it has nothing to do with the order in which they were born. In fact, the number of parents in the home or being raised in an orphanage or foster home is not the cause of bipolar either. Financial Situation: Rich people and poor people as well as middle income people all get bipolar disorder at the same rate. It is not caused by money or the lack of money. Financial stresses can bring on episodes of bipolar or worsen symptoms but the money issues are NOT the cause of the disorder itself. Hormones or Sex Drive: Many people experiencing a bipolar episode may seek sexual attention or practice risky sexual behavior, blaming it on their hormones. This is NOT a cause of bipolar disorder; instead, it is a symptom of an existing disorder. Menopause or mid-life crisis: See hormones above. Changes in hormones can worsen symptoms of an existing disorder but do NOT cause the disorder in any way. Fear of the changes occurring due to aging may well trigger symptoms but do not cause them. Environment: Often, people believe that being raised by a parent that has bipolar disorder or being around people that have the disorder can cause a person to become bipolar, similar to catching a cold. Environment is never the cause of bipolar. The stress and frustration of being around people that are in the throes of bipolar episodes can well bring on symptoms in a person that already had the disorder, whether diagnosed or not, but the stress does not CAUSE the disorder. Bipolar disorder is not contagious. However, due to the heredity connection, those raised in a home where others have the disorder makes them more likely to also have the disorder but the CAUSE is not the environment at all. Accident/illness/health problems: Bipolar disorder is not caused by an accident, a long or short illness or the presence of health problems. The stress of having health concerns may bring out symptoms but the cause is not health-related. Being dropped on the head as a baby is not a cause. Having a really awful car accident is not the cause. Being confined to a wheelchair is not a cause of bipolar disorder, either. Side effect of a medication: Bipolar disorder is not caused by taking a prescribed (or street-obtained) medication. If a person has bipolar symptoms while taking a medication, it could be a reaction."",

Kampala – Entebbe Expressway
Opened to traffic in June 2018, Kampala – Entebbe expressway connects the Northern Bypass at Busega to Uganda’s international Airport. This is the first-ever toll road in the country and was developed by the Uganda National Road Authority
The consultation for this billion project between the Government of Uganda and China began in 2009. It was meant to improve traffic conditions and mitigate the congestion on the bypass and the distributor roads in urban areas. Its routes and Design details
This infrastructure has two lanes in each direction and two road sections (36.94km long section and 12.68km long link road). The speed limit on this road ranges between 50km/ -100km/h. Its 36.94km long section is divided into two parts whereby the first 24.9km stretch of the sections starts at a point on the Kampala Northern Bypass and runs along the new route before ending at Abayita ababiri. The 12.04km section starts at the Interchange (Abayita ababiri) and winds along the existing Kampala-Entebbe road. 7.4km of it was widened and 4.64km upgraded to the latest standards. Apart from that, its 12.68km long roads originate from the highway at Kajjansi interchange and continue eastwards up to Munyonyo. Bridges and Interchanges on the Expressway
Adding to the four interchanges at Kajjansi, Busega, Lweza and Mpala, this expressway features nineteen over-bridges and eighteen underpasses that provide access to other areas around. Besides that, three main toll plazas were built on the expressway at Mpala, Kajjansi and Busega. Mpala and Kajjansi toll plazas have five gates. The Busega toll plaza differs itself unique with six toll gates. Moreover, two suspension bridges that measure 200m and 500m by length were put up over the Lubiji swamp in Busega and Kyengera. Its highway includes a 75m long bridge at Kajjansi and the 1.45m long suspension bridge over Nambigirwa swamp. The 240 pillars that support Nambigirwa swamp have a lifespan of 100 years and were installed to a depth of 55m. The Main Contractors
UNRA awarded the design-build contract to China Communication Construction Company in October 2010. Then in May 2012, Beijing Expressway Supervision was selected as the consulting engineer for the supervision of the design and construction of this road. The site project management, investigations and laboratory tests, and geotechnical survey services for the expressway were provided between January 2012 and 2013 by the Ugandan consulting firm Project Management and Engineering. Thereafter UNRA engaged the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank as the transaction adviser for this project. The IFC then contracted IMC Worldwide and Vetiver Associates to provide preliminary assessment for the toll road
Financing for the Project
It was jointly funded by the government of Uganda and the Exim Bank of China. Of $476 m for the project, Uganda contributed only USD 126m and the remaining part of USD350m came from the pockets of China Exim Bank but given as a preferential buyer credit loan. The agreement was signed by GoU in May 2011. This loan is to be paid back in a period of 40 years by the government through collecting taxes from its citizens. More to be paid is the USD 40m used for compensation to the landowners who were vacated from areas where the expressway passed. What are the Benefits of this toll road? The main aim of this world-class carriageway was to ease traffic congestion on main roads in Kampala city and its suburbs. Uganda’s road traffic is growing at an estimated rate of 4.5 per cent per year. This is due to the increased number of vehicles in Kampala and other cities. This path will also reduce the travel time from Kampala to Entebbe or vice versor. It takes about 30 minutes. This is time-saving when compared to 120 minutes for someone who is using the old Kampala – Entebbe road.

In this series we are doing a deep dive into the sourcing process today, and, in particular discussing what is involved, what is typically done (manually), and whether or not it should be that way. We have already completed our initial discussion of the initial project request review phase, the follow up needs assessment, the strategy selection phase, the communication phase, the analysis phase, and the negotiations phase. Now we are in the final contracting phase. At first glance, it looks like this is the second most strategic and human-driven phase there is, second only to negotiation, as it is humans (and lawyers in particular) who typically define standard terms and conditions, humans who identify risk and mitigation strategies, humans who define obligations, and humans who analyze the contract for compliance to goals. But is this the case? So in this final step, the contract step, we have these final sub-steps:
- Standard Terms and Conditions
- Modification & Risk Mitigation to Supplier & Country
- Key Metadata definition and obligation specification
- Contract Analytics
If all of the standard terms and conditions are in existing contracts and the contract clause / template repository, there’s no reason that a system cannot automatically scan the contracts and repositories, identify the standard organizational terms in every contract, identify the standard terms for the category, and identify any terms, often not included, that would be relevant to the category. Probabilities can be applied and contract terms organized by weight. The buyer can then just bulk select or bulk reject the relevant clauses. In the modification and risk mitigation step, a contract analytics engine can be applied to determine how well a particular clause addresses a certain risk of relevance to the organization based on context models and differentials. It can then compare that clause to the clauses that best address the risk and identify the necessary modifications, and do so specifically from a supplier or geographic context. In the key metadata definition and obligation specification step, the goal is to identify the right metadata that needs to be tracked against the contract. This will be dependent on the terms and conditions, the goals, the obligations, and other key information that will be specific to the contract. However, contract analytics can identify, or at least suggest, much of this as well automatically based upon similar contracts, similar terms, similar goals, and similar obligations. This can greatly reduce the effort required by a buyer. In the final step, the contract analytics step, the identification of risks, variances from a norm, and non-standard clauses can often be better identified by a contracts analytics engine that can cross-compare potentially risky clauses and variant clauses across hundreds, if not thousands, of contracts and identify deviations from the norm. A user just has to decide whether the variance is enough to be of interest to them, and properly setting a threshold can eliminate the majority of those variances that are not. In other words, at the end of the day, contract analytics identifies the majority of standard terms and conditions that are of interest, the majority of standard clauses that will need modifications to address supplier and country risk, the relevant metadata and obligations associated with the contract, and any clauses that can be considered variant enough to warrant special consideration. The majority of the work can be automated with a good contract analytics engine — the role of the buyer is to apply their intelligence to determine how accurate and effective it is. As the buyer trains the engine, it will become more and more accurate over time and the strategic work will be reduced to hours, sometimes minutes for simple contracts, compared to days or weeks. In other words, the more we explore the sourcing process, the more we find out how truly tactical, or at least automatable, the majority of it is.

This agreement (in conjunction with the trade agreement) contains all understanding and agreement between the parties as to the purpose of this agreement and replaces all agreements, documents, projections, financial data, statements and advance guarantees, orally orally, explicit or implied, between the parties concerned and their related companies, representatives and agents concerned with respect to the purpose of this agreement. the offer or terms and conditions that brought the parties together. This is the “meat” of the contract, and perhaps the one that your lawyer will offer most of the instructions until you get the ride. But people rarely go wrong when they are too specific; it is the lack of essential details or uncertainty that can cause problems. If you enter into a z.B business contract to sell your office copier, you must provide details such as a description of the equipment, sale price, terms of sale and date of transaction. There are six essential elements necessary for a contract to be valid (enforceable through the courts). The first three, which are considered together, refer to the agreement itself and the other three relate to the parties who enter into the contract. Contractual guarantees are less important conditions and are not fundamental to the agreement. They cannot terminate a contract if the guarantees are not fulfilled, but they can claim damages for the losses incurred. While these are some of the most common legal agreements you might see in an economic context, they can cover an almost infinite number of topics as long as the elements are in place and are not prohibited by law. And while some contracts may not need to be written, ALWAYS is a better idea to do so. Both parties must be “reasonable” to understand the seriousness of the situation and understand what is necessary. This definition requires that neither party be minor, both must be sober (not under the influence of drugs or alcohol when signing the contract) and no rehabilitation can be mentally deficient. If a party is not competent, the contract is not valid and the unmarried party may refuse (ignore) the contract. Contract management is part of running a small business. They will have a number of business relationships that involve some kind of contractual obligation or obligation. Don`t waste time negotiating a commercial contract with someone who doesn`t have the power to make a binding decision. It should be in the person`s best interest to ensure that you are complying with the obligations of the agreement. Legality should be the simplest part of the contract. This means that the terms and conditions must be legal; If not, the contract is not valid. For example, the sale of a photocopier is legal; Breaking into a closed store in the middle of the night, stealing a photocopier and selling it on an online shopping site is not the case. Each contract must include a specific offer and acceptance of that specific offer. Both parties must accept their free will. Neither party can be forced or forced to sign the contract and both parties must agree to the same conditions. These three conditions imply the intention of the parties to create a binding agreement. If one or both parties are not serious, there is no contract. TIP: If it is not possible to have a written contract, make sure you have other documentation such as emails, offers or notes of your discussions to help you identify what has been agreed. Contractual terms are fundamental to the agreement.

There may always be instances where the contract will be in question, especially if there’s a third party that may cause a burden. For instance, if you have a contract to buy a house but amid the transaction, a hurricane comes by and destroys it, what would it entail? Would the buyer still need to purchase it with the same amount or would it be less? You would also need to indicate what each party should and should not do. 4. Make sure to elaborate on the terms and conditions in the contract. Be specific and layout all the exact terms to avoid confusion, especially if this agreement affects a whole organization or future leaders. If there are damages or liabilities which the opposite party accepts, this too should be included in the terms. 5. Of course, all contracts can also end as agreed by both parties so it is also advisable to add a termination clause. This clause states all the legal ways of removing one party or both parties from such agreement without breach. This is most essential for long term contacts. 6. Never forget to sign and notarize. Make a contract legal by obtaining the signature of both parties which also means naming it after those involved. Having it notarized is also essential as it will make the contract a public instrument and can be used in court. It means nothing if the offer is accepted but has no written proof. If there should be changes, negotiation should be done and altered in the contract. 7. Lastly, make sure that all things agreed are legal and binding. Consider the age of the people involved, the nature of the industry and if the agreement was made in good faith. Any fraudulent transactions or threats can void the contract. Format of a contract
There’s no definite format for contracts since its content can go long or short, depending on the agreement. The essential elements that need to be found on a contract though can be summed up in this sample which elaborates on the parts of a client-vendor contract. This is a short description of the two parties who are in agreement, the sum of the project, duration of the project or date, and the monetary value or cost of the agreement. Provide information about the agreement that includes the job, duties, responsibilities, and promises of the vendor and the client. If there are payment terms involved, this will be considered a responsibility for the client. 3. Scope of work
This part elaborates on the deliverables of the vendor. If there is a budget involved, explain in detail what they get in return. Explain the inclusions, freebies (if any), limitations and any process that should be observed. Indicate how a situation be managed when things don’t go as planned. May it be changes, challenges, “acts of God” such as interventions from nature, or anything affecting the agreement to change. Place the additional fees or workload that should be included if there are any. 5. Rights of clients and vendors
If this was a product such as music, graphic design or photos, copyright ownerships can be elaborated in the contract. You can indicate the limitations of where it can or cannot be used, you can also explain if the work is completely turned over to the client or if a non-editable work is only given. If you don’t want this work to be used in billboards, you can also limit the ownership to digital use. As long as it was agreed, it can be placed on the contract. This is often optional for small online businesses or freelancers but for big companies, this is a must. Explain the duration of which your company is willing to fix/return or exchange the product or service. It is recommended though that the date be specific rather than placing a number of days in the contract to avoid loopholes. Of course, if the warranty is over, the question still is what happens next? What should the client pay for your company to fix things after the expiration of the warranty? 7. Fees and payment method
Will the payment be paid in full once the work is done? Is there a 50% down payment required before the project is started? Will there be a monthly fee or additional fee when plans change? How would the timeline look like? These are the common questions that you should ask yourself when drafting this section. If you can, it is best to assign an amount for every milestone reached, especially if the payment terms are in staggered payment terms. Not all partnerships and client-vendor relationships work. If there is a need to cancel the contract, this section should indicate what are valid premises, the conditions and what should be done to cancel the whole agreement. 9. Acceptance by signature
Make sure to get it signed and sealed!

• 3rd Contract Large-scale Prime Construction (Prime). USAID/Indonesia originally planned on awarding this contract in September 2006 to complete the remaining road construction, including bridges and culverts. However, this was delayed because the Mission and prospective contractor did not reach agreement on price. In October 2006, the Mission began a new solicitation process and the contract was awarded in June 2007. The project was scheduled to be completed by February 2010. 1 A Strategic Objective Agreement is the principal bilateral grant agreement used by USAID with a foreign government or a subdivision of it. Although USAID/Indonesia originally committed to reconstruct the entire 243 km roadway between Banda Aceh and Meulaboh, the Government of Japan through its Japan International Cooperation System (JICS) was already rehabilitating the existing road from Calang to Meulaboh. In June 2006, USAID/Indonesia, JICS, and the GOI reached an agreement that there would be a single route for the entire roadway between Banda Aceh and Meulaboh, and that JICS would continue its road work from Calang to Meulaboh. As a result, USAID/Indonesia reduced its original project scope to about 144 km from 243 km, which included building two bypasses in the JICS road segment. Figure 1 shows a map of the Aceh road project, including the JICS segment. Figure 1: Map of the Aceh Road Project

In October 2006, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) conducted a review of USAID/Indonesia’s road reconstruction project as part of its Congressionally mandated monitoring of U.S. reconstruction assistance to tsunami-affected countries. In its report, GAO concluded that USAID/Indonesia faced increased risk that it may not successfully complete the project at planned cost and on schedule because of factors typically related to the difficulty of operating in a post-disaster environment, such as increased construction costs and delays in land acquisition. 3 As a result, USAID/Indonesia did realize an increase in costs above the original government estimate. As of March 31, 2007, the total budget for the Aceh road project was estimated to cost $253 million, of which USAID/Indonesia had obligated about $103 million and disbursed $18 million for Aceh road project activities. OIG photograph of road construction near the Raba River bridge crossing at Km 25 in Aceh Province, Indonesia. (March 2007) AUDIT OBJECTIVE The Regional Inspector General/Manila conducted this audit as part of its fiscal year 2007 annual audit plan to answer the following question: Is USAID/Indonesia managing the Aceh Road Reconstruction Project under its • Tsunami Recovery and Reconstruction Program to minimize the risk of not completing the project on schedule and at planned cost? Appendix I contains a discussion of the audit’s scope and methodology. 3 GAO, Foreign Assistance USAID Signature Tsunami Reconstruction Efforts in Indonesia and Sri Lanka Exceed Initial Cost and Schedule Estimates, and Face Further Risks , GAO-07-357 (Washington, D.C.: February 28, 2007)
AUDIT FINDINGS USAID/Indonesia was managing the Aceh Road Reconstruction Project under its Tsunami Recovery and Reconstruction Program to minimize the risk of not completing the project on schedule and at planned cost. While USAID/Indonesia faced many unforeseen difficulties during the start of the Aceh road project in a post-disaster environment, since about May 2006 the Mission significantly stepped up its actions to proactively identify, prioritize, and manage both internal and external factors that could impact on such risk. Nevertheless, these risk factorssome of which were beyond the Mission’s controlimpacted on the Aceh road project and caused delays.

It is the responsibility of the Tenderer to acquaint himself fully with the tax and excise laws in force in the Recipient Country prior to the submission of the Tender. 4.8 All prices and unit rates quoted in the Schedule of Prices shall be in Danish Kroner. 4.9 It is emphasized that the Client will not be able to engage in traditional negotiations with the Tenderers regarding the tenders submitted. With respect to negotiations, the Client will operate within the rules of negotiation set out, among others, in Council and Commission statement concerning Council Directive 93/37/EEC of 14 June 1993: ""The Council and the Commission state that in open and restricted procedures all negotiations with candidates or tenderers on fundamental aspects of contracts, variations in which are likely to distort competition, and in particular on prices, shall be ruled out; however, discussions with candidates or tenderers may be held but only for the purpose of clarifying or supplementing the content of their tenders of the requirements of the contracting authorities and provided this does not involve discrimination."" Hence, no contract or price negotiations as such shall be conducted and, therefore, the Tenderers should ensure that the wording of their tenders allows the contract to be concluded without prior negotiations between the tenderer and the contracting authorities. It is thus of the utmost importance that the tenders are comprehensive and consider all relevant issues, contain all necessary information, and are precise in every respect. 5. Submission of the Tender 5.1 The Tenderer shall prepare one original set (technical- and price part), 2 copies, a PDF file and supplementary information, as described in these Instructions. Each such set shall be submitted in two inner envelopes within an outer envelope. One inner envelope shall include the Letter of Tender and the Technical Schedules and be marked ""Technical Part"" and the other shall include the Schedule of Prices and be marked ""Price Part"". The technical part shall be submitted in one original, 2 copies, and as PDF files, each not exceeding 5 MB, on one CD ROM / one USB Memory Stick, all in one envelope marked Technical Part.

Part 2 – Technical
This article is part of the shortened content of a training course I held last year at our company for a number of trainees on how to write winning proposals for MATOC or IDIQ contracts. There are 10 parts to this training. In the previous article, we went over some common issues and general ideas about MATOC/IDIQ contracts. From here on, we will explain each part of the proposal in detail. This article is about the Technical section of the proposal. Many RFPs require a technical section. Do not confuse this with the Technical Proposal vs Price Proposal that is usually required. The technical section is where you explain your solution with technical details and show its merit. Be it an IT project or a service/maintenance or construction or training, all such projects usually require you to provide your solution in detail. I will take one step further and say: even if the RFP requirements don’t ask for it, go ahead and give the reviewer the information. He will understand that you know your business. This will make him more confident about your capabilities. Understanding the Requirements:
I cannot emphasize more how important it is to fully understand the RFP requirements as a whole. When it comes to the technical part, it is so importance that can mean having a losing or a winning solution/proposal. You need to read and reread, do research, get to your inside contacts if you have, ask questions from the contracting officer and use all other means to make sure that you have covered all areas of concern and are fully in sync with the mentality of the client. You need to ask yourself why are they putting out this RFP, what are their concerns, what have been the issues in previous executions of this contract – if it is a repeat – what are the client’s metrics, …
To do that, put yourself in the shoes of the government selection committee. First you need to understand what you want and what you are concerned about. Then you need to know what metric to use to select from the different solutions offered to you and how to assess them. Go through this mental practice. It will help you shape your proposal, it will help you put key explanations where they are needed to clear questions from the mind of the reader, and it will help you be in sync with the reader. Compliance with the Technical Requirements:
The proposal should address each work area in sufficient detail to demonstrate a clear understanding of the statement of work, including operations and maintenance problems presented therein, if any. Your proposal should provide evidence of sufficient planning to show that work will be accomplished as required and on schedule, utilizing all available resources. You need to demonstrate a firm understanding of the requirements and goals set forth in the scope of work, and address each separately. The best way to do this is to prepare a compliance matrix (chart), identifying client’s needs side by side with your solutions. Sometimes the RFP requires that matrix, but even if it doesn’t, you should include it. It will save a lot of work from the reviewer and he will be thankful of you because you have decreased his workload. Obviously each proposal has its own unique solution but a set of general guidelines can be derived:
- Be Complete, Accurate and Persuasive
- Identify the outcomes they’re looking to achieve
- Recommend a solution that solves/satisfies client’s needs, issues, and/or concerns
- Include the facilities, equipment, software, special expertise, methods used, and technologies on which your solution is based on
- Identify the challenges and give solutions for the challenges
- Present evidence that your team can deliver your solution on time and on budget (case studies)
- Avoid marketing fluff, technical jargon, and outrageous claims. At the sametime, don’t just describe features of your solution; describe the benefits too. Forget about those who tell you that proposals should use minimum graphics. Pictures, drawings, charts, infographic and art work capture attention, and reduce the dullness of the pages of writing. Put yourself in the shoes of the reviewers. They read proposals often under less-than-ideal conditions, when they are very busy, in late hours, under pressure… like all of us. So you need to give them some spirit and cheer them up through your proposal; don’t make them more tired and bored. At the same time, don’t overdo yourself. Use maximum one graphic piece for each subject. Don’t be abstract, make it to the point.

However, the most important thing to be aware of is how all the local pro-roadies link up to present a web of influence. This may be done by forming a formal group, along with local politicians. The Newbury Bypass Forum, for instance, manipulated local opinion effectively in 1995, presenting a vociferous political lobby to pressurise national government to approve the Newbury Bypass. The most important links will be behind the scenes - local businesses, landowners and politicians all have their hands in each others' pockets. Expose the vested interests! Contract Award Procedures
Firstly, the contract will usually be advertised by the roadbuilding agency in the trade press, inviting contractors to ""pre-qualify"" for the contract. This means demonstrating their ability and credentials to successfully complete the contract. This stage is sometimes omitted for preliminary contracts. The roadbuilding agency will then select a shortlist of contractors (often six) who will be invited to submit bids. These contractors will prepare a detailed price estimate of their costs in completing the contract. This represents a significant investment of time and money by each contractor, who must submit their bid (or ""tender"") by a certain date stated by the roadbuilding agency. The agency will then work through the bids, eliminating them until it awards the contract - often to the lowest bidder. The construction press will have the latest news on contracts, including which contractors have been shortlisted, and rumours about who is most likely to win. The roadbuilding agency will make an official announcement when it's ready, but the contract will have been sewn up before then. Once a main contract has been signed, stopping the road becomes very much harder. We suggest putting a lot of energy and thought into sabotaging the contract award procedures (see ideas within Chapter 10). A Note About Dbfo & Private Finance
New publicly-funded trunk roads are currently rare in Britain, and private finance is becoming more important. In many other parts of the world, it is the usual means of funding infrastructure. We mention it here because private finance procedures may vary from those described above. In particular, the UK system of DBFO (Design, Build, Finance, Operate) is very different; bidders must form a consortium, comprising civil engineers, consulting engineers, financiers, traffic consultants, and legal advisers, to bid for a contract. The contract involves some new scheme planning and construction, but also maintenance of a stretch of highway for some years, all at the consortium's own cost. At the end of this time, the consortium will be reimbursed by the Treasury according to a number of factors, including traffic levels - a reward for generated traffic! The main difference with a DBFO contract is its greater scope and complexity, and a higher burden of risk on contractors. If the road you're fighting is DBFO or private finance, we suggest exploiting all the extra issues raised. For background info on DBFOs contact Transport 2000 or ALARM UK (see Chapter 16). Chapter 8 - Preparing for Action
When considering Nonviolent Direct Action (NVDA), and particularly as the start of work looms, there are lots of things you can do to set up a framework for sustained action. The further in advance you start, the more comprehensive your preparation will be. The contractors won't phone up to let you know when they are coming, so it is important to regularly visit the route or area under threat and get to know it intimately. Note all sightings of suspicious-looking people or vehicles. Start a list of contractor's vehicles, any telephone numbers on them, and their number plates. Cameras may be useful for identifying key contractor's staff. Don't feel afraid to approach them. Try to find out where they come from. Ask them politely what they are doing, but remember they may well lie. If they are contractors or surveyors, let them know that they are not welcome, perhaps chase them off or obstruct them. It may be best to watch surveyors without approaching them (see Chapter 10). A co-ordinated route monitoring rota prevents duplication of effort. If monitoring is only done once each day, it shouldn't be too early as contractors could arrive at any time. Strategically placed people with binoculars and a good view of approach roads, paths and car parks, should spot any unwanted activity. Ask dog walkers and other locals (especially those living very near the route) to look out for and report anything unusual.

Entebbe Road leads to Uganda’s only international airport, and is one of the country’s busiest roads. The road links Wakiso District to Kibuye in Kampala to Mpala, Entebbe - passing through Kibuye, Kajjansi, and Abayita Ababiri before ending at the airport, a total distance of about 40 kilometres. Before the opening of the Entebbe–Kampala Expressway, the Entebbe road was the only direct link between Kampala and the international airport. The road is a single carriageway, and is narrow and congested with a heavy volume of traffic on the road. Because of the congestion, it is one of the most accident-prone roads in the country. Traffic on this road had reduced substantially after the completion of the Kampala-Entebbe Expressway in 2018, as many motorists resorted to using the expressway as an alternative route to avoid traffic congestion on the existing Kampala-Entebbe road. However, traffic on the road has since increased following the government implementation of toll payments on the Kampala-Entebbe Expressway in January this year (2022). Experience the impeccable road stretch away from the hustle of the city, as you drive past magnificent nature with fresh air kicking in across every bend. Experience the Kampala- Entebbe Expressway in all its glory. #KEEUG #ExploreUganda pic.twitter.com/Sub1dt5NuL— Kampala Entebbe Expressway (@KEE_UG) March 29, 2022\nLast year, the Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) awarded a contract for the rehabilitation of a 22 kilometres stretch of the Entebbe road from Mpala, Entebbe in Wakiso District to Kibuye in Kampala. UNRA is the Ugandan government agency responsible for developing and maintaining the country's national roads network and advise the government on general road policies and national transport concerns. The contract for the rehabilitation of the 22 kilometre road stretch from Entebbe to Kibuye was awarded to the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), at a cost of US$12 million. The scope of the rehabilitation works includes the restoration of existing sidewalks, the construction of drainage channels to avoid flooding, in particular around the Kajjansi region, and the installation of street lights. Construction works commenced on the rehabilitation of the road sometime in August / September 2021. At the end of March this year (2022), the CCCC site engineer on the project, Mr Guo Zitong, stated that the project was 50% complete and would be completed within five months, i.e. in August this year (2022). This is according to a news article posted on the website of the Daily Monitor, a Ugandan newspaper. The Daily Monitor article also reported that the UNRA media relations manager, Mr Allan Ssempebwa, said that the road rehabilitation works in the section between Mpala and Kisubi in Wakiso district included stone pitching of side drains to aid the adequate flow of stormwater, shoulder repair, major full road width repairs, and installation of access culverts as well as access road construction to reduce silt damage on main pavements. Ssempebwa further explained that “Particular attention will be given to some sections, especially those prone to floodings, such as Lubowa, Zzana and Namasuba. For instance, the Bata-Bata area will be fixed with proper drainage systems”. Also speaking on the Entebbe-Kibuye road rehabilitation, Mr Francis Ojok, speaking on behalf of the officer in charge of Traffic in the Kajjansi area, emphasized the importance of the roadworks to free up traffic issues in the area. The introduction of pedestrian walkways will also help reduce the number of traffic accidents. Currently, traffic management is difficult due to the blocking of part of the roadway to aid the construction work. Assistant Superintendent of Police, Luke Nuwataho, also commented that the Kajjansi area has been experiencing flooding which should be resolved by the road works.

This is the first-ever toll road in the country and was developed by the Uganda National Road Authority\nThe consultation for this billion project between the Government of Uganda and China began in 2009. It was meant to improve traffic conditions and mitigate the congestion on the bypass and the distributor roads in urban areas. Its routes and Design details\nThis infrastructure has two lanes in each direction and two road sections (36.94km long section and 12.68km long link road). The speed limit on this road ranges between 50km/ -100km/h. Its 36.94km long section is divided into two parts whereby the first 24.9km stretch of the sections starts at a point on the Kampala Northern Bypass and runs along the new route before ending at Abayita ababiri. The 12.04km section starts at the Interchange (Abayita ababiri) and winds along the existing Kampala-Entebbe road. 7.4km of it was widened and 4.64km upgraded to the latest standards. Apart from that, its 12.68km long roads originate from the highway at Kajjansi interchange and continue eastwards up to Munyonyo. Bridges and Interchanges on the Expressway\nAdding to the four interchanges at Kajjansi, Busega, Lweza and Mpala, this expressway features nineteen over-bridges and eighteen underpasses that provide access to other areas around. Besides that, three main toll plazas were built on the expressway at Mpala, Kajjansi and Busega. Mpala and Kajjansi toll plazas have five gates. The Busega toll plaza differs itself unique with six toll gates. Moreover, two suspension bridges that measure 200m and 500m by length were put up over the Lubiji swamp in Busega and Kyengera. Its highway includes a 75m long bridge at Kajjansi and the 1.45m long suspension bridge over Nambigirwa swamp. The 240 pillars that support Nambigirwa swamp have a lifespan of 100 years and were installed to a depth of 55m. The Main Contractors\nUNRA awarded the design-build contract to China Communication Construction Company in October 2010. Then in May 2012, Beijing Expressway Supervision was selected as the consulting engineer for the supervision of the design and construction of this road. The site project management, investigations and laboratory tests, and geotechnical survey services for the expressway were provided between January 2012 and 2013 by the Ugandan consulting firm Project Management and Engineering. Thereafter UNRA engaged the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank as the transaction adviser for this project. The IFC then contracted IMC Worldwide and Vetiver Associates to provide preliminary assessment for the toll road\nFinancing for the Project\nIt was jointly funded by the government of Uganda and the Exim Bank of China. Of $476 m for the project, Uganda contributed only USD 126m and the remaining part of USD350m came from the pockets of China Exim Bank but given as a preferential buyer credit loan. The agreement was signed by GoU in May 2011. This loan is to be paid back in a period of 40 years by the government through collecting taxes from its citizens. More to be paid is the USD 40m used for compensation to the landowners who were vacated from areas where the expressway passed. What are the Benefits of this toll road? The main aim of this world-class carriageway was to ease traffic congestion on main roads in Kampala city and its suburbs. Uganda’s road traffic is growing at an estimated rate of 4.5 per cent per year. This is due to the increased number of vehicles in Kampala and other cities. This path will also reduce the travel time from Kampala to Entebbe or vice versor. It takes about 30 minutes. This is time-saving when compared to 120 minutes for someone who is using the old Kampala – Entebbe road.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:3b66253e-2ea9-4432-b47a-e0fa41fb3aca>']}, {'passage': 'In this series we are doing a deep dive into the sourcing process today, and, in particular discussing what is involved, what is typically done (manually), and whether or not it should be that way. We have already completed our initial discussion of the initial project request review phase, the follow up needs assessment, the strategy selection phase, the communication phase, the analysis phase, and the negotiations phase. Now we are in the final contracting phase. At first glance, it looks like this is the second most strategic and human-driven phase there is, second only to negotiation, as it is humans (and lawyers in particular) who typically define standard terms and conditions, humans who identify risk and mitigation strategies, humans who define obligations, and humans who analyze the contract for compliance to goals. But is this the case? So in this final step, the contract step, we have these final sub-steps:\n- Standard Terms and Conditions\n- Modification & Risk Mitigation to Supplier & Country\n- Key Metadata definition and obligation specification\n- Contract Analytics\nIf all of the standard terms and conditions are in existing contracts and the contract clause / template repository, there’s no reason that a system cannot automatically scan the contracts and repositories, identify the standard organizational terms in every contract, identify the standard terms for the category, and identify any terms, often not included, that would be relevant to the category. Probabilities can be applied and contract terms organized by weight. The buyer can then just bulk select or bulk reject the relevant clauses. In the modification and risk mitigation step, a contract analytics engine can be applied to determine how well a particular clause addresses a certain risk of relevance to the organization based on context models and differentials. It can then compare that clause to the clauses that best address the risk and identify the necessary modifications, and do so specifically from a supplier or geographic context. In the key metadata definition and obligation specification step, the goal is to identify the right metadata that needs to be tracked against the contract. This will be dependent on the terms and conditions, the goals, the obligations, and other key information that will be specific to the contract. However, contract analytics can identify, or at least suggest, much of this as well automatically based upon similar contracts, similar terms, similar goals, and similar obligations. This can greatly reduce the effort required by a buyer. In the final step, the contract analytics step, the identification of risks, variances from a norm, and non-standard clauses can often be better identified by a contracts analytics engine that can cross-compare potentially risky clauses and variant clauses across hundreds, if not thousands, of contracts and identify deviations from the norm. A user just has to decide whether the variance is enough to be of interest to them, and properly setting a threshold can eliminate the majority of those variances that are not. In other words, at the end of the day, contract analytics identifies the majority of standard terms and conditions that are of interest, the majority of standard clauses that will need modifications to address supplier and country risk, the relevant metadata and obligations associated with the contract, and any clauses that can be considered variant enough to warrant special consideration. The majority of the work can be automated with a good contract analytics engine — the role of the buyer is to apply their intelligence to determine how accurate and effective it is. As the buyer trains the engine, it will become more and more accurate over time and the strategic work will be reduced to hours, sometimes minutes for simple contracts, compared to days or weeks. In other words, the more we explore the sourcing process, the more we find out how truly tactical, or at least automatable, the majority of it is.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:8899ebdb-4b4f-4846-b11d-77935a9c0381>']}, {'passage': 'This agreement (in conjunction with the trade agreement) contains all understanding and agreement between the parties as to the purpose of this agreement and replaces all agreements, documents, projections, financial data, statements and advance guarantees, orally orally, explicit or implied, between the parties concerned and their related companies, representatives and agents concerned with respect to the purpose of this agreement. the offer or terms and conditions that brought the parties together. This is the “meat” of the contract, and perhaps the one that your lawyer will offer most of the instructions until you get the ride. But people rarely go wrong when they are too specific; it is the lack of essential details or uncertainty that can cause problems. If you enter into a z.B business contract to sell your office copier, you must provide details such as a description of the equipment, sale price, terms of sale and date of transaction. There are six essential elements necessary for a contract to be valid (enforceable through the courts). The first three, which are considered together, refer to the agreement itself and the other three relate to the parties who enter into the contract. Contractual guarantees are less important conditions and are not fundamental to the agreement. They cannot terminate a contract if the guarantees are not fulfilled, but they can claim damages for the losses incurred. While these are some of the most common legal agreements you might see in an economic context, they can cover an almost infinite number of topics as long as the elements are in place and are not prohibited by law. And while some contracts may not need to be written, ALWAYS is a better idea to do so. Both parties must be “reasonable” to understand the seriousness of the situation and understand what is necessary. This definition requires that neither party be minor, both must be sober (not under the influence of drugs or alcohol when signing the contract) and no rehabilitation can be mentally deficient. If a party is not competent, the contract is not valid and the unmarried party may refuse (ignore) the contract. Contract management is part of running a small business. They will have a number of business relationships that involve some kind of contractual obligation or obligation. Don`t waste time negotiating a commercial contract with someone who doesn`t have the power to make a binding decision. It should be in the person`s best interest to ensure that you are complying with the obligations of the agreement. Legality should be the simplest part of the contract. This means that the terms and conditions must be legal; If not, the contract is not valid. For example, the sale of a photocopier is legal; Breaking into a closed store in the middle of the night, stealing a photocopier and selling it on an online shopping site is not the case. Each contract must include a specific offer and acceptance of that specific offer. Both parties must accept their free will. Neither party can be forced or forced to sign the contract and both parties must agree to the same conditions. These three conditions imply the intention of the parties to create a binding agreement. If one or both parties are not serious, there is no contract. TIP: If it is not possible to have a written contract, make sure you have other documentation such as emails, offers or notes of your discussions to help you identify what has been agreed. Contractual terms are fundamental to the agreement.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:79a7e0c1-cff7-4f07-a94d-3b146e12d13d>']}, {'passage': 'There may always be instances where the contract will be in question, especially if there’s a third party that may cause a burden. For instance, if you have a contract to buy a house but amid the transaction, a hurricane comes by and destroys it, what would it entail? Would the buyer still need to purchase it with the same amount or would it be less? You would also need to indicate what each party should and should not do. 4. Make sure to elaborate on the terms and conditions in the contract. Be specific and layout all the exact terms to avoid confusion, especially if this agreement affects a whole organization or future leaders. If there are damages or liabilities which the opposite party accepts, this too should be included in the terms. 5. Of course, all contracts can also end as agreed by both parties so it is also advisable to add a termination clause. This clause states all the legal ways of removing one party or both parties from such agreement without breach. This is most essential for long term contacts. 6. Never forget to sign and notarize. Make a contract legal by obtaining the signature of both parties which also means naming it after those involved. Having it notarized is also essential as it will make the contract a public instrument and can be used in court. It means nothing if the offer is accepted but has no written proof. If there should be changes, negotiation should be done and altered in the contract. 7. Lastly, make sure that all things agreed are legal and binding. Consider the age of the people involved, the nature of the industry and if the agreement was made in good faith. Any fraudulent transactions or threats can void the contract. Format of a contract\nThere’s no definite format for contracts since its content can go long or short, depending on the agreement. The essential elements that need to be found on a contract though can be summed up in this sample which elaborates on the parts of a client-vendor contract. This is a short description of the two parties who are in agreement, the sum of the project, duration of the project or date, and the monetary value or cost of the agreement. Provide information about the agreement that includes the job, duties, responsibilities, and promises of the vendor and the client. If there are payment terms involved, this will be considered a responsibility for the client. 3. Scope of work\nThis part elaborates on the deliverables of the vendor. If there is a budget involved, explain in detail what they get in return. Explain the inclusions, freebies (if any), limitations and any process that should be observed. Indicate how a situation be managed when things don’t go as planned. May it be changes, challenges, “acts of God” such as interventions from nature, or anything affecting the agreement to change. Place the additional fees or workload that should be included if there are any. 5. Rights of clients and vendors\nIf this was a product such as music, graphic design or photos, copyright ownerships can be elaborated in the contract. You can indicate the limitations of where it can or cannot be used, you can also explain if the work is completely turned over to the client or if a non-editable work is only given. If you don’t want this work to be used in billboards, you can also limit the ownership to digital use. As long as it was agreed, it can be placed on the contract. This is often optional for small online businesses or freelancers but for big companies, this is a must. Explain the duration of which your company is willing to fix/return or exchange the product or service. It is recommended though that the date be specific rather than placing a number of days in the contract to avoid loopholes. Of course, if the warranty is over, the question still is what happens next? What should the client pay for your company to fix things after the expiration of the warranty? 7. Fees and payment method\nWill the payment be paid in full once the work is done? Is there a 50% down payment required before the project is started? Will there be a monthly fee or additional fee when plans change? How would the timeline look like? These are the common questions that you should ask yourself when drafting this section. If you can, it is best to assign an amount for every milestone reached, especially if the payment terms are in staggered payment terms. Not all partnerships and client-vendor relationships work. If there is a need to cancel the contract, this section should indicate what are valid premises, the conditions and what should be done to cancel the whole agreement. 9.

USAID/Indonesia originally planned on awarding this contract in September 2006 to complete the remaining road construction, including bridges and culverts. However, this was delayed because the Mission and prospective contractor did not reach agreement on price. In October 2006, the Mission began a new solicitation process and the contract was awarded in June 2007. The project was scheduled to be completed by February 2010. 1 A Strategic Objective Agreement is the principal bilateral grant agreement used by USAID with a foreign government or a subdivision of it. Although USAID/Indonesia originally committed to reconstruct the entire 243 km roadway between Banda Aceh and Meulaboh, the Government of Japan through its Japan International Cooperation System (JICS) was already rehabilitating the existing road from Calang to Meulaboh. In June 2006, USAID/Indonesia, JICS, and the GOI reached an agreement that there would be a single route for the entire roadway between Banda Aceh and Meulaboh, and that JICS would continue its road work from Calang to Meulaboh. As a result, USAID/Indonesia reduced its original project scope to about 144 km from 243 km, which included building two bypasses in the JICS road segment. Figure 1 shows a map of the Aceh road project, including the JICS segment.

In its report, GAO concluded that USAID/Indonesia faced increased risk that it may not successfully complete the project at planned cost and on schedule because of factors typically related to the difficulty of operating in a post-disaster environment, such as increased construction costs and delays in land acquisition. 3 As a result, USAID/Indonesia did realize an increase in costs above the original government estimate. As of March 31, 2007, the total budget for the Aceh road project was estimated to cost $253 million, of which USAID/Indonesia had obligated about $103 million and disbursed $18 million for Aceh road project activities.

(March 2007) AUDIT OBJECTIVE The Regional Inspector General/Manila conducted this audit as part of its fiscal year 2007 annual audit plan to answer the following question: Is USAID/Indonesia managing the Aceh Road Reconstruction Project under its • Tsunami Recovery and Reconstruction Program to minimize the risk of not completing the project on schedule and at planned cost? Appendix I contains a discussion of the audit’s scope and methodology. 3 GAO, Foreign Assistance USAID Signature Tsunami Reconstruction Efforts in Indonesia and Sri Lanka Exceed Initial Cost and Schedule Estimates, and Face Further Risks , GAO-07-357 (Washington, D.C.: February 28, 2007)\nAUDIT FINDINGS USAID/Indonesia was managing the Aceh Road Reconstruction Project under its Tsunami Recovery and Reconstruction Program to minimize the risk of not completing the project on schedule and at planned cost. While USAID/Indonesia faced many unforeseen difficulties during the start of the Aceh road project in a post-disaster environment, since about May 2006 the Mission significantly stepped up its actions to proactively identify, prioritize, and manage both internal and external factors that could impact on such risk. Nevertheless, these risk factorssome of which were beyond the Mission’s controlimpacted on the Aceh road project and caused delays.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:20a3879f-cc98-43cd-b521-ba0e6fe2e1f5>']}, {'passage': 'In this event, all rights and obligations of the Client and the Tenderers previously related to the original date shall thereafter be subject to the amended date.

There are 10 parts to this training. In the previous article, we went over some common issues and general ideas about MATOC/IDIQ contracts. From here on, we will explain each part of the proposal in detail. This article is about the Technical section of the proposal. Many RFPs require a technical section. Do not confuse this with the Technical Proposal vs Price Proposal that is usually required. The technical section is where you explain your solution with technical details and show its merit. Be it an IT project or a service/maintenance or construction or training, all such projects usually require you to provide your solution in detail. I will take one step further and say: even if the RFP requirements don’t ask for it, go ahead and give the reviewer the information. He will understand that you know your business. This will make him more confident about your capabilities. Understanding the Requirements:\nI cannot emphasize more how important it is to fully understand the RFP requirements as a whole. When it comes to the technical part, it is so importance that can mean having a losing or a winning solution/proposal. You need to read and reread, do research, get to your inside contacts if you have, ask questions from the contracting officer and use all other means to make sure that you have covered all areas of concern and are fully in sync with the mentality of the client. You need to ask yourself why are they putting out this RFP, what are their concerns, what have been the issues in previous executions of this contract – if it is a repeat – what are the client’s metrics, …\nTo do that, put yourself in the shoes of the government selection committee. First you need to understand what you want and what you are concerned about. Then you need to know what metric to use to select from the different solutions offered to you and how to assess them. Go through this mental practice. It will help you shape your proposal, it will help you put key explanations where they are needed to clear questions from the mind of the reader, and it will help you be in sync with the reader. Compliance with the Technical Requirements:\nThe proposal should address each work area in sufficient detail to demonstrate a clear understanding of the statement of work, including operations and maintenance problems presented therein, if any. Your proposal should provide evidence of sufficient planning to show that work will be accomplished as required and on schedule, utilizing all available resources. You need to demonstrate a firm understanding of the requirements and goals set forth in the scope of work, and address each separately. The best way to do this is to prepare a compliance matrix (chart), identifying client’s needs side by side with your solutions. Sometimes the RFP requires that matrix, but even if it doesn’t, you should include it. It will save a lot of work from the reviewer and he will be thankful of you because you have decreased his workload. Obviously each proposal has its own unique solution but a set of general guidelines can be derived:\n- Be Complete, Accurate and Persuasive\n- Identify the outcomes they’re looking to achieve\n- Recommend a solution that solves/satisfies client’s needs, issues, and/or concerns\n- Include the facilities, equipment, software, special expertise, methods used, and technologies on which your solution is based on\n- Identify the challenges and give solutions for the challenges\n- Present evidence that your team can deliver your solution on time and on budget (case studies)\n- Avoid marketing fluff, technical jargon, and outrageous claims. At the sametime, don’t just describe features of your solution; describe the benefits too. Forget about those who tell you that proposals should use minimum graphics. Pictures, drawings, charts, infographic and art work capture attention, and reduce the dullness of the pages of writing. Put yourself in the shoes of the reviewers. They read proposals often under less-than-ideal conditions, when they are very busy, in late hours, under pressure… like all of us. So you need to give them some spirit and cheer them up through your proposal; don’t make them more tired and bored. At the same time, don’t overdo yourself. Use maximum one graphic piece for each subject. Don’t be abstract, make it to the point.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:f0d2b143-4e28-4476-bca4-4ae10c04bc70>']}, {'passage': 'However, the most important thing to be aware of is how all the local pro-roadies link up to present a web of influence. This may be done by forming a formal group, along with local politicians. The Newbury Bypass Forum, for instance, manipulated local opinion effectively in 1995, presenting a vociferous political lobby to pressurise national government to approve the Newbury Bypass. The most important links will be behind the scenes - local businesses, landowners and politicians all have their hands in each others\' pockets. Expose the vested interests! Contract Award Procedures\nFirstly, the contract will usually be advertised by the roadbuilding agency in the trade press, inviting contractors to ""pre-qualify"" for the contract. This means demonstrating their ability and credentials to successfully complete the contract. This stage is sometimes omitted for preliminary contracts. The roadbuilding agency will then select a shortlist of contractors (often six) who will be invited to submit bids. These contractors will prepare a detailed price estimate of their costs in completing the contract. This represents a significant investment of time and money by each contractor, who must submit their bid (or ""tender"") by a certain date stated by the roadbuilding agency. The agency will then work through the bids, eliminating them until it awards the contract - often to the lowest bidder. The construction press will have the latest news on contracts, including which contractors have been shortlisted, and rumours about who is most likely to win. The roadbuilding agency will make an official announcement when it\'s ready, but the contract will have been sewn up before then. Once a main contract has been signed, stopping the road becomes very much harder. We suggest putting a lot of energy and thought into sabotaging the contract award procedures (see ideas within Chapter 10). A Note About Dbfo & Private Finance\nNew publicly-funded trunk roads are currently rare in Britain, and private finance is becoming more important. In many other parts of the world, it is the usual means of funding infrastructure. We mention it here because private finance procedures may vary from those described above. In particular, the UK system of DBFO (Design, Build, Finance, Operate) is very different; bidders must form a consortium, comprising civil engineers, consulting engineers, financiers, traffic consultants, and legal advisers, to bid for a contract. The contract involves some new scheme planning and construction, but also maintenance of a stretch of highway for some years, all at the consortium\'s own cost. At the end of this time, the consortium will be reimbursed by the Treasury according to a number of factors, including traffic levels - a reward for generated traffic! The main difference with a DBFO contract is its greater scope and complexity, and a higher burden of risk on contractors. If the road you\'re fighting is DBFO or private finance, we suggest exploiting all the extra issues raised. For background info on DBFOs contact Transport 2000 or ALARM UK (see Chapter 16). Chapter 8 - Preparing for Action\nWhen considering Nonviolent Direct Action (NVDA), and particularly as the start of work looms, there are lots of things you can do to set up a framework for sustained action. The further in advance you start, the more comprehensive your preparation will be. The contractors won\'t phone up to let you know when they are coming, so it is important to regularly visit the route or area under threat and get to know it intimately. Note all sightings of suspicious-looking people or vehicles. Start a list of contractor\'s vehicles, any telephone numbers on them, and their number plates. Cameras may be useful for identifying key contractor\'s staff. Don\'t feel afraid to approach them. Try to find out where they come from. Ask them politely what they are doing, but remember they may well lie. If they are contractors or surveyors, let them know that they are not welcome, perhaps chase them off or obstruct them. It may be best to watch surveyors without approaching them (see Chapter 10). A co-ordinated route monitoring rota prevents duplication of effort. If monitoring is only done once each day, it shouldn\'t be too early as contractors could arrive at any time. Strategically placed people with binoculars and a good view of approach roads, paths and car parks, should spot any unwanted activity. Ask dog walkers and other locals (especially those living very near the route) to look out for and report anything unusual.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:1fd5ac91-5f1a-4522-9e0e-df7c31a46361>']}, {'passage': 'EU solidarity with Ukraine\nProzorro+: Ukrainian public procurement platform\nMalawi-Lilongwe: General public services\nProcurement award procedure applying to European Union external actions financed from NDICI Global Europe.

Entebbe Road leads to Uganda\u2019s only international airport, and is one of the country\u2019s busiest roads. The road links Wakiso District to Kibuye in Kampala to Mpala, Entebbe - passing through Kibuye, Kajjansi, and Abayita Ababiri before ending at the airport, a total distance of about 40 kilometres. Before the opening of the Entebbe\u2013Kampala Expressway, the Entebbe road was the only direct link between Kampala and the international airport. The road is a single carriageway, and is narrow and congested with a heavy volume of traffic on the road. Because of the congestion, it is one of the most accident-prone roads in the country. Traffic on this road had reduced substantially after the completion of the Kampala-Entebbe Expressway in 2018, as many motorists resorted to using the expressway as an alternative route to avoid traffic congestion on the existing Kampala-Entebbe road. However, traffic on the road has since increased following the government implementation of toll payments on the Kampala-Entebbe Expressway in January this year (2022). Experience the impeccable road stretch away from the hustle of the city, as you drive past magnificent nature with fresh air kicking in across every bend. Experience the Kampala- Entebbe Expressway in all its glory. #KEEUG #ExploreUganda pic.twitter.com/Sub1dt5NuL\u2014 Kampala Entebbe Expressway (@KEE_UG) March 29, 2022\nLast year, the Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) awarded a contract for the rehabilitation of a 22 kilometres stretch of the Entebbe road from Mpala, Entebbe in Wakiso District to Kibuye in Kampala. UNRA is the Ugandan government agency responsible for developing and maintaining the country's national roads network and advise the government on general road policies and national transport concerns. The contract for the rehabilitation of the 22 kilometre road stretch from Entebbe to Kibuye was awarded to the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), at a cost of US$12 million. The scope of the rehabilitation works includes the restoration of existing sidewalks, the construction of drainage channels to avoid flooding, in particular around the Kajjansi region, and the installation of street lights. Construction works commenced on the rehabilitation of the road sometime in August / September 2021. At the end of March this year (2022), the CCCC site engineer on the project, Mr Guo Zitong, stated that the project was 50% complete and would be completed within five months, i.e. in August this year (2022). This is according to a news article posted on the website of the Daily Monitor, a Ugandan newspaper. The Daily Monitor article also reported that the UNRA media relations manager, Mr Allan Ssempebwa, said that the road rehabilitation works in the section between Mpala and Kisubi in Wakiso district included stone pitching of side drains to aid the adequate flow of stormwater, shoulder repair, major full road width repairs, and installation of access culverts as well as access road construction to reduce silt damage on main pavements. Ssempebwa further explained that \u201cParticular attention will be given to some sections, especially those prone to floodings, such as Lubowa, Zzana and Namasuba. For instance, the Bata-Bata area will be fixed with proper drainage systems\u201d. Also speaking on the Entebbe-Kibuye road rehabilitation, Mr Francis Ojok, speaking on behalf of the officer in charge of Traffic in the Kajjansi area, emphasized the importance of the roadworks to free up traffic issues in the area. The introduction of pedestrian walkways will also help reduce the number of traffic accidents. Currently, traffic management is difficult due to the blocking of part of the roadway to aid the construction work. Assistant Superintendent of Police, Luke Nuwataho, also commented that the Kajjansi area has been experiencing flooding which should be resolved by the road works.

                ""text"": ""Kampala \u2013 Entebbe Expressway\nOpened to traffic in June 2018, Kampala \u2013 Entebbe expressway connects the Northern Bypass at Busega to Uganda\u2019s international Airport. This is the first-ever toll road in the country and was developed by the Uganda National Road Authority\nThe consultation for this billion project between the Government of Uganda and China began in 2009. It was meant to improve traffic conditions and mitigate the congestion on the bypass and the distributor roads in urban areas. Its routes and Design details\nThis infrastructure has two lanes in each direction and two road sections (36.94km long section and 12.68km long link road). The speed limit on this road ranges between 50km/ -100km/h. Its 36.94km long section is divided into two parts whereby the first 24.9km stretch of the sections starts at a point on the Kampala Northern Bypass and runs along the new route before ending at Abayita ababiri. The 12.04km section starts at the Interchange (Abayita ababiri) and winds along the existing Kampala-Entebbe road. 7.4km of it was widened and 4.64km upgraded to the latest standards. Apart from that, its 12.68km long roads originate from the highway at Kajjansi interchange and continue eastwards up to Munyonyo. Bridges and Interchanges on the Expressway\nAdding to the four interchanges at Kajjansi, Busega, Lweza and Mpala, this expressway features nineteen over-bridges and eighteen underpasses that provide access to other areas around. Besides that, three main toll plazas were built on the expressway at Mpala, Kajjansi and Busega. Mpala and Kajjansi toll plazas have five gates. The Busega toll plaza differs itself unique with six toll gates. Moreover, two suspension bridges that measure 200m and 500m by length were put up over the Lubiji swamp in Busega and Kyengera. Its highway includes a 75m long bridge at Kajjansi and the 1.45m long suspension bridge over Nambigirwa swamp. The 240 pillars that support Nambigirwa swamp have a lifespan of 100 years and were installed to a depth of 55m. The Main Contractors\nUNRA awarded the design-build contract to China Communication Construction Company in October 2010. Then in May 2012, Beijing Expressway Supervision was selected as the consulting engineer for the supervision of the design and construction of this road. The site project management, investigations and laboratory tests, and geotechnical survey services for the expressway were provided between January 2012 and 2013 by the Ugandan consulting firm Project Management and Engineering. Thereafter UNRA engaged the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank as the transaction adviser for this project. The IFC then contracted IMC Worldwide and Vetiver Associates to provide preliminary assessment for the toll road\nFinancing for the Project\nIt was jointly funded by the government of Uganda and the Exim Bank of China. Of $476 m for the project, Uganda contributed only USD 126m and the remaining part of USD350m came from the pockets of China Exim Bank but given as a preferential buyer credit loan. The agreement was signed by GoU in May 2011. This loan is to be paid back in a period of 40 years by the government through collecting taxes from its citizens. More to be paid is the USD 40m used for compensation to the landowners who were vacated from areas where the expressway passed. What are the Benefits of this toll road? The main aim of this world-class carriageway was to ease traffic congestion on main roads in Kampala city and its suburbs. Uganda\u2019s road traffic is growing at an estimated rate of 4.5 per cent per year. This is due to the increased number of vehicles in Kampala and other cities. This path will also reduce the travel time from Kampala to Entebbe or vice versor. It takes about 30 minutes. This is time-saving when compared to 120 minutes for someone who is using the old Kampala \u2013 Entebbe road."",

The President said government will continue with the construction of roads in the Albertine region and that construction works for the Mubende \u2013 Kakumiro \u2013 Kibaale road will soon be launched. \u201cGovernment is to acquire more road construction machinery for the maintenance of murrum roads in the country,\u201d said Museveni while addressing a public gathering at Kagadi Model primary School in Kagadi Town Council, Kibaale District on Saturday. President Museveni assured the people that Bunyoro roads will be constructed in phases using equipment secured from Japan. Bunyoro region has some of the worst roads in the country, keeping people in poverty. The World Bank representative, Ms Christina Calve, said the road will enhance the social-economic well being of people in the Albertine region, improve access market and create jobs for the youth."",

                ""text"": ""Uganda has signed a Ush500 billion ($134 million) deal with a Chinese company to design and construct a section of its planned oil roads. The 97km road is part of a total 700km package to be constructed before oil starts flowing by 2022. The critical oil roads have been packaged into six, with two of the packages yet to receive a contractor. According to the Uganda National Roads Authority (Unra), the contractor\u2014China Railway Seventh Group\u2014under a pre-financing arrangement is expected to temporally meet the construction costs for a period of one year until the government secures funding. The authority, however, didn\u2019t mention from where the government expects to secure the funds. During the contract signing in Kampala, Unra executive director Allen Kagina noted that at least 30 per cent of the works had been reserved for local contractors. In December 2016, the Cabinet directed Unra to have the roads in place to facilitate the transportation of construction materials by oil companies. Oil companies have previously complained that the bulk of the heavy machinery needed to construct oil wells is yet to be shipped into the country because it cannot be moved on existing roads. The companies said the machines are heavy that need good roads. Faced with this problem and time to beat, the authority is considering an option of having particular parts of the roads made motorable. \u201cThe contractor is called on to fast-track the work by beginning at two end points and also with bottlenecks like bridges, swamps, sharp corners so that the road is open to traffic even when the construction is incomplete,\u201d said Mr Kagina. The authority however, is exercising caution on some of these roads since they pass through delicate ecosystems, such as Budongo forest, Murchison Falls National P ark and numerous swamps all of which need much environmental attention during construction. As a requirement of the three-year contract, Unra is expected to hand over the road site to the contractor who commences works in May this year when at least 30 per cent of the right of way has been secured to enable smooth movement. Land acquisition for major government projects in Uganda has been a problem, mostly over compensation disputes, which last year prompted Cabinet to suggest a constitutional amendments that will allow for compulsory acquisition of land by the government for major projects. Uganda has of 6.5 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves with about 2.2 billion recoverable. While the clock to 2020 ticks, Uganda is still faced with a challenge of completing major infrastructural development that will facilitate the oil sector like roads, a pipeline and the Kabaale international airport in Hoima district."",

A corporation is a business entity that is owned by its shareholder(s), who elect a board of directors to oversee the organization’s activities. The corporation is liable for the actions and finances of the business – the shareholders are not. Corporations can be for-profit, as businesses are, or not-for-profit, as charitable organizations typically are. Types of Corporations There are two major types of corporations as well: Subchapter C corporations, which are larger organizations owned by multiple shareholders, which can also be other businesses, and Subchapter S corporations, which are often (but not always) smaller businesses owned by an individual shareholder. Before creating a corporation, consider what you hope to gain from establishing this separate entity. The biggest advantages of having a corporation are: - As with some other types of businesses, corporations provide liability protection for its owners, who are called shareholders. - Companies hoping to raise money from investors will have an easier time as a corporation, which can sell ownership shares. - Corporate profits are taxed, but at a lower rate than the personal income tax rate individuals pay. - Potential employees may find working for a corporation, with the prospect of ownership benefits, to be more appealing than working for a privately-held company. - The corporation can offer a medical reimbursement plan, deducting the cost of providing insurance to employees while allowing employees to use the benefit tax-free. While corporations can certainly shield owners from liability, the downsides are sizeable and very costly: - C Corporations are complex and expensive to set up. - Once established, corporations spend significant sums of money to stay on top of changing business regulations and timely filing of paperwork. They are best for large organizations with many employees. - Corporations pay federal, state, and sometimes local taxes on profits, unlike LLCs. - The corporation pays taxes on dividends paid to shareholders, who then pay taxes on that income themselves. Forming a Corporation Corporations are often formed in the state in which the business operates, but it doesn’t have to be. Some corporations are formed in states thought to be pro-business, such as Delaware or Nevada, although that creates extra paperwork. You then need to register the corporation as a foreign entity in the state in which you are doing business, and pay taxes to that state. The next step is creating Articles of Incorporation, which are filed with the state in which you have registered the corporation. These include: - The name and physical address of the business. - A description of the business and its goods and services. - The name and address of the registered agent, or the person authorized to receive official notices. - A count of the number of shares issued and to whom. And then create by-laws, which are the rules of the corporation. They include, at a minimum: - How often the board of directors meets, and when. - Whether the business operates on a calendar or fiscal year. - How long board members can serve. - Rules for changing by-laws. By-laws can be amended as needed once the corporation is formed. If you expect at some point in the near future to take your company public through an initial public offering (IPO), a C corporation may make a lot of sense.",first turn question; Natural,"the initial question of a conversation, and therefore self-contained and understandable, without any other context.; phrased in the way people typically speak, reflecting everyday language use, without formal or artificial structure.",Expert,A specialized user with deep understanding of the corpus.,What are the key tax implications for corporations compared to other business structures?,"Corporations face distinct tax implications: they pay federal, state, and sometimes local taxes on profits, unlike LLCs. Additionally, there's a double taxation situation where the corporation pays taxes on dividends paid to shareholders, and then shareholders must pay taxes on that income themselves. However, corporate profits are taxed at a lower rate than the personal income tax rate individuals pay.","The key tax implications for corporations, specifically C-Corporations, differ from other business structures such as sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S-Corporations. Here are the main differences:

1. **Double Taxation**: C-Corporations are subject to double taxation. The corporation pays income taxes on its profits at the corporate level, and then shareholders pay personal income taxes on any dividends they receive from the corporation. This is often considered a disadvantage compared to other structures.

2. **Pass-Through Taxation**: Sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S-Corporations are pass-through entities. This means that the business itself does not pay income taxes. Instead, the profits and losses flow through to the individual owners' personal tax returns. This avoids the double taxation issue.

3. **Tax Rates**: The corporate tax rate for C-Corporations is a flat 21% on their taxable income. However, individual income tax rates can be higher, especially for high earners. Pass-through entities are subject to individual income tax rates, which can vary based on income levels and deductions.

4. **Self-Employment Taxes**: Owners of sole proprietorships and partnerships are subject to self-employment taxes (Social Security and Medicare taxes) on their business income. In a corporation, these taxes are split between the employer (the corporation) and the employee (the owner).

5. **Deductions and Credits**: Corporations can take advantage of a wide range of business deductions and credits, such as depreciation, research and development expenses, and certain tax credits. Sole proprietors and partners can also deduct business expenses, but they may not have access to all the same deductions and credits as corporations.

6. **International Considerations**: Corporations, especially those with international operations, may face additional tax complexities, such as foreign tax credits, controlled foreign corporation (CFC) rules, and potentially double taxation treaties.

7. **State Taxes**: C-Corporations are subject to state corporate income taxes in most states, whereas sole proprietors, partners, and S-Corporations typically only pay state income taxes on their share of the business's income.

8. **Flexibility in Distribution of Profits**: Corporations have more flexibility in distributing profits to shareholders through dividends, stock redemptions, and other means, while pass-through entities must distribute profits to owners as income, regardless of whether it is distributed or not.

9. **Estate Planning**: Corporations offer more estate planning opportunities, such as stock gifting, trusts, and gifting of ownership interests, which can help reduce estate taxes.

10. **Retaining Earnings**: Corporations can retain earnings without immediate tax consequences, which can be advantageous for reinvesting in the business or building a cash reserve. Pass-through entities must distribute profits to owners, who then pay taxes on that income.

In summary, the key tax implication of corporations compared to other business structures is the double taxation of profits, which can result in higher overall tax burdens. However, corporations also offer benefits such as perpetual life, ease of ownership transfer, and access to various tax benefits and deductions.","You are a helpful assistant.

### Context: When conceptualizing a new venture, this decision is seldom given the thought and consideration it deserves. Start your business the right way by addressing this first. By Michael F. O'Keefe
WHETHER SETTING UP YOUR BUSINESS as a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company (LLC), S-Corporation, or C-Corporation, it is vital to understand, not only the filing and paperwork requirements, but also the different tax implications that are present with each type of business structure. Commonly, owner-operated small businesses are set up as sole proprietorships due to the simplicity of the filings and regulation, as well as the single-layer tax impact on the revenues of the business. This type of ownership also allows the owner to be his or her own boss. However, owners should be extremely cautious when dealing as a sole proprietor or in a general partnership. These two types of business structures allow for all of the liabilities of the business to be shared with the individual owners on a personal level. As such, unlimited liability can be scary. Just remember to hope for the best but plan for the worst. Don’t choose a business structure based on the ease and convenience of setting it up. It is more common than one would think to have business situations end in lawsuits resulting in general partners and sole proprietors being sued personally and losing homes, cars and savings accounts. There are plenty of hurdles that these types of business owners have to overcome. Management can be difficult with limited participants and there is commonly a very overwhelming time commitment associated with this type of business. There are two types of members in a partnership: a general partner and a limited partner. General partners have unlimited liability and they are typically managers of the company. Limited partners have exactly what you would think: limited liability. They, also, usually do not have a role managing the company. Just remember, no matter how well the individual partners get along, one of the most common issues with partnerships is the disagreements that arise between members. This sometimes leads to unfortunate falling-outs between friends. Most successful types of businesses are corporations—either limited liability companies, conventional corporations (C-Corps), or S-Corporations. These three forms of business ownership comprise approximately 80% of all sales in the United States and they all share two major benefits; the first being that they have limited liability, and the second, they usually qualify for special tax advantages that other types of business ownerships do not. Incorporating a business is a great strategy as it allows for the company to grow, it has perpetual life, ownership can change hands easily, and it’s common for corporations to be able to afford talented employees. However, as a sword can cut both ways, there are some disadvantages to incorporating a business. Corporations are more costly to start, they require more paperwork, possible conflicts with other owners and board members can arise, and they are also affected by double taxation, which means that the business’ profits will be taxed, as well as the shareholders’ dividends. A special type of incorporation is called an S-Corporation. Aside from sharing the benefit of limited liability, this type of corporation has a major difference from a conventional C-Corporation: It has much simpler taxes, called ‘single taxation,’ that are similar to that of a partnership. Downsides of incorporating as an S-Corporation include ineligibility for a dividends received deduction, and that S-Corps are not subject to the 10% of taxable income limitation that are applicable to charitable contribution deductions. Choosing the best type of business is a personal choice, albeit one that shouldn’t be taken lightly. The prospected longevity, growth and future development of the business should be taken into serious consideration before the choice to incorporate is made.

When it comes to setting up corporate structures there are a variety of considerations to bear in mind. There are both commercial and tax implications that need to be considered. The adage that the tax tail should not wag the commercial dog is very true in these situations. However, one of the main commercial considerations in determining the best structure for the business is actually to consider the tax implications, as they will have a big impact on the financials for the business. Setting up a Limited company:
A Limited company structure provides important protection due to the ""limited liability"" characteristic of companies. By being a Limited liability company it means that the shareholders are protected from loss of their own personal assets. Another advantage of Limited company status is the current favourable taxation treatment of companies compared with sole traders/individuals. Some problems inherent with a Limited liability structure include that the structure is rather rigid in that incoming or exiting shareholders will have various implications for the business - and there will be taxation implications on the disposal of shares or ""company buy back"" of shares. Limited Liability Partnerships:
Limited liability partnerships allow for greater flexibility in that profits sharing ratios can be changed dependant on private agreements of the Partners. The main constituational document of the partnership will be the partnership agreement. This will control the way in which the partnership interacts and behaves with its members and the way in which business is conducted by the partnership. An LLP is tax transparent and therefore the taxation of the profits of the partnership fall onto the ""members"" of the LLP. There are a variety of benefits in setting up a corporate group structure - either at the inception of the business or at a future point in time. We have advised many clients on the benefits of setting up a corporate structure such that they can benefit from important tax reliefs such as Substantial Shareholders' exemption on a disposal of part of the business. It is important to liaise with us in advance of making any important decisions as there will often be certain ways of carrying out transactions that will be more beneficial from a taxation perspective. Please contact your usual MG Group contact if you would like to find out more about the options available in setting up a business structure and to determine what the advantages and disadvantages are from each type of business structure.

As a small business owner, it's important to understand the tax implications of your business decisions. Failing to comply with tax laws can result in penalties and fines, so it's essential to stay informed about the tax considerations that apply to your business. In this blog post, we will explore some of the key tax considerations that small businesses need to be aware of. The type of business structure you choose, such as sole proprietorship, partnership, LLC or corporation, will affect how your business is taxed.

Small businesses can claim deductions for various business expenses, such as office rent, employee salaries, office supplies, and more. Be sure to keep accurate records and receipts of your business expenses to maximize your deductions. Depending on the type of business you run, you may be required to collect sales taxes from customers and remit them to the government. It's important to understand the sales tax laws that apply to your business and to stay current with changes in the tax code. Self-employed individuals and small business owners are often required to pay estimated taxes throughout the year. It's important to understand the rules for estimated taxes and to make timely payments to avoid penalties. As an employer, you are responsible for withholding taxes from your employees' paychecks and remitting them to the government. You must also file the necessary forms with the government to report the taxes you have withheld. Small business owners can take advantage of retirement plans, such as a solo 401(k) or a Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRA, to save for retirement and reduce their tax liabilities.

Over the past 30 years, the activity of businesses that are subject to the individual income tax has grown compared with that of businesses subject to the corporate income tax. That shift has reduced federal revenues but probably promoted overall investment and a more efficient allocation of resources. Most business receipts—the revenues that businesses receive from sales of goods and services—come from a relatively small number of firms subject to the corporate income tax, called C corporations. However, other organizational forms allow businesses to avoid the corporate tax by passing their profits through to their owners, where they are subject to the individual income tax. Use of those pass-through structures has grown: In 1980, 83 percent of firms passed profits through to their owners for taxation, and they accounted for 14 percent of business receipts; by 2007, those shares had increased to 94 percent and 38 percent, respectively. Organizational forms that provide owners with the same protection from liability for the debts of the firm that the owners of C corporations receive were almost entirely responsible for that growth. Today’s CBO report Taxing Businesses Through the Individual Income Tax examines the size and causes of the shift in organizational structure, the effect it has had on federal revenues, and the potential effects on revenues and investment of various alternative approaches to taxing businesses’ profits. The report examines three potential approaches to the taxation of businesses’ profits:

Not only are corporations subject to corporate income tax at both the federal and state levels, but any earnings distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends are taxed at individual tax rates on their personal income tax returns. The S corporation is more attractive to small-business owners than a regular (or C) corporation because an S corporation has some appealing tax benefits and still provides business owners with the liability protection of a corporation. With an S corporation, income and losses are passed through to shareholders and included on their individual tax returns. As a result, there’s just one level of federal tax to pay. In addition, owners of S corporations who don’t have inventory can use the cash method of accounting, which is simpler than the accrual method. S corporations can also have up to 100 shareholders. This makes it possible to have more investors and thus attract more capital, tax experts maintain. S corporations do come with some downsides. For example, S corporations are subject to many of the same rules corporations must follow, and that means higher legal and tax service costs. They also must file articles of incorporation, hold directors and shareholders meetings, keep corporate minutes, and allow shareholders to vote on major corporate decisions. The legal and accounting costs of setting up an S corporation are also similar to those for a regular corporation. Another major difference between a regular corporation and an S corporation is that S corporations can only issue one class of stock. Experts say this can hamper the company’s ability to raise capital. In addition, unlike in a regular corporation, S corporation stock can only be owned by individuals, estates and certain types of trusts. In 1998, tax-exempt organizations such as qualified pension plans were added to the list. This change provides S corporations with even greater access to capital because a number of pension plans are willing to invest in closely held small-business stock. Putting Inc. to Paper
To start the process of incorporating, contact the secretary of state or the state office that's responsible for registering corporations in your state. Ask for instructions, forms and fee schedules on incorporating. It's possible to file for incorporation without the help of an attorney by using books and software to guide you. Your expense will be the cost of these resources, the filing fees and other costs associated with incorporating in your state. If you do it yourself, you'll save the expense of using a lawyer, which can cost from $500 to $5,000 if you choose a firm that specializes in startup businesses. The disadvantage is that the process may take you some time to accomplish. There is also a chance you could miss some small but important detail in your state’s law. One of the first steps in the incorporation process is to prepare a certificate or articles of incorporation. Some states provide a printed form for this, which either you or your attorney can complete. The corporation will also need a set of bylaws that describe in greater detail than the articles how the corporation will run, including the responsibilities of the company’s shareholders, directors and officers; when stockholder meetings will be held; and other details important to running the company. Once your articles of incorporation are accepted, the secretary of state’s office will send you a certificate of incorporation. Laying the Foundation
When making a decision about which business structure to use, answering the following questions should help you narrow down which entity is right for you:
- How many owners will your company have, and what will their roles be? - Are you concerned about the tax consequences of your business structure? - Do you want to consider having employees become owners in the company? - Can you deal with the added costs that come with selecting a complicated business structure? - How much paperwork are you prepared to deal with? - Do you want to make all the decisions in the company? - Are you planning to go public? - Do you want to protect your personal resources from debts or other claims against your company? - Are family succession issues a concern? Even after you settle on a business structure, remember that the circumstances that make one type of business organization favorable are always subject to changes in the laws. It makes sense to reassess your form of business from time to time to make sure you are using the one that provides the most benefits.

If you've been in business for a while as a sole proprietor, you may be wondering whether it would be a good idea to incorporate. We can help you make that decision with information on: why a business owner would want to incorporate, how a corporation is structured, and how corporations are taxed. Reasons for incorporating
Picture this: You started a small landscaping business a few years ago as a sole proprietorship with three employees. Demand was so great for your services that you kept hiring more people and taking on debt to purchase more equipment, and the number of customers has soared. But lately you've started to wonder: What happens if business slows and you can't pay back all the debt? What if a disgruntled employee or unhappy customer sues you? As a sole proprietor you're personally liable for any bad debts and legal judgments against your business, meaning that your home and other personal assets are likely at risk. When you incorporate, you're creating a completely separate legal entity, one that can shoulder the liability burden you had been carrying yourself (or if you are a partnership, the burden you and the other partners were carrying). Forming a corporation also allows you to:
- Reward and retain key staff by giving workers a piece of the business. - Have more options for raising funds. Instead of going into more debt, you can attract equity investors. - Shift tax liability away from you to the corporate entity. But you'll have to weigh some disadvantages as well:
- It usually takes more time and money to incorporate than to form other types of businesses. - Corporations typically are subject to more regulation at both the federal and state level, and the tax rules can be more complicated. - The management structure of a corporation is usually more rigid, often giving you, as the owner, less flexibility to run things as you see fit. Typically, a corporation has a three-tiered structure, which consists of:
- Shareholders: As company owners, they are the linchpins of the corporation. They often have the power to select and remove directors, amend bylaws, approve the sale of assets and dissolve the corporation. You don't necessarily have to have a lot of shareholders. In fact, most states permit one person to hold 100% of the corporation's stock. - Directors: They act on behalf of the stockholders, managing the company, making major decisions about the firm's direction and electing company officers. Most states allow corporations to have a single director, but some require a minimum of three. - Officers: In most states, corporations must have at least a president, secretary and treasurer to handle day-to-day running of the business, but many states also allow one person to hold all three positions. Steps to becoming a corporation
To get your corporation started, you'll need to draw up Articles of Incorporation in the state where your business is headquartered. The articles declare basic facts about the company, including its name, purpose and the number of shares authorized. You file this document with the appropriate state office (usually the Secretary of State or Department of Commerce) and pay a filing fee, which can be as much as several hundred dollars. You may want to hire an attorney to handle the process. Most states will process your filing and send you a Certificate of Incorporation. With your Certificate in hand, you can take the next steps, including appointing directors and holding your first directors' meeting. You'll need to draw up bylaws, which detail the rights of the shareholders, directors and officers. You also must issue stock. It doesn't have to be widely-held, but generally must be distributed to everyone who is an owner of the corporation. Tax issues for corporations
Once you have incorporated, you'll probably notice a big difference in how your company is treated for tax purposes. You'll no longer file Schedule C and report your net profit or loss on your 1040. Instead, the corporation files a business tax return, Form 1120, and if it is a C-Corp, pays tax on its corporate profits. Many owners of new, small corporations may get a pleasant surprise at tax time. That's because sole proprietors can't deduct any salaries they pay themselves, but after incorporating they become employees, and their compensation can be written off by the corporate entity. Once those and other deductions are taken, there may be little corporate profit left to tax.

An S corporation owner who works for the company must be paid a reasonable income and must pay tax and FICA on that amount. This tax status prevents double taxation because S corporation profits are dispersed to shareholders. Another benefit of S corporation status is that a S corp owner can deduct 20% of his or her share of business income from his or her taxes, in addition to the typical deductions for business expenses. The owner's income as an employee is used to compute the Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction. Personal service firms such as accountancy, law, consulting, and financial services are not eligible for this deduction. Furthermore, for higher-income business owners, the QBI deduction is limited or unavailable. Using IRS Form 8832
Entity Classification Election to be taxed as a corporation. The choice to be taxed as a new entity takes effect on the date provided on line 8 of Form 8832. The election cannot take effect more than 75 days before or after the filing date, and it cannot take effect more than 12 months after the filing date. A consent statement is included in the form 8832, which can be signed by all members or by one person on behalf of all members. If only one person signs, there should be a record in the company membership meetings that this election was approved by all members, form 8832. You must supply the names of the owners as well as the number(s) of owners (Social Security Number for a single-member LLC, and Employer ID Number for multiple member LLC). Use IRS Form 2553 - Election by a Small Business Corporation to be taxed as a S Corporation. You must file by March 15 for the new tax classification to take effect for the entire year. You'll need to include information on each shareholder, such as their name and address, the number of shares they own, their Social Security number, the end of their tax year, and a consent statement. The LLC's Tax Benefits
Avoids Double Taxation
The LLC owner is not subject to double taxes, which is a benefit over corporations. A corporation pays corporate taxes, while the corporation's owners are shareholders who pay taxes on dividends received. Corporations are subject to double taxation, which means that the corporation pays income taxes and shareholders pay dividend taxes. Corporate Franchise Tax Can Be Avoided
Corporations must pay state corporate franchise taxes in some states, but LLCs are not required to do so in others. This varies widely by state, so check with your state's tax department to see what they require. Small Business Owner Tax Deductions
LLC owners and other small business owners can now take advantage of a new deduction not accessible to corporation shareholders. It's known as the Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction, and it allows LLC owners to deduct 20% of their net income in addition to their standard business cost deductions. The LLC's Tax Disadvantages
LLC members are required to pay taxes on their distributive part of the company's profits, even if they have not received a distribution of those profits. Profits are not taxed unless they are given to shareholders, usually in the form of dividends. Taxes Due on Self-Employment
Self-employment taxes (Social Security/Medicare) also hurt LLC owners hard. While corporation employees pay half of the self-employment tax and the company pays the other half, the LLC owner pays both employer and employee amounts. What is the definition of a business structure? A business structure is a form of legal structure for a company. It's critical to take your time when beginning a new firm to choose the correct sort of business entity. The business structure you choose has little impact on the day-to-day operations of your company, but it is critical for identifying ownership, minimising personal liability, managing business taxes, and planning for future expansion. Business entities, at their most basic level, establish the company as a legal entity capable of having bank accounts, entering into contracts, and conducting business without having to do it in your personal name. Working under your own name may be fine for some very small firms, but if you expect to earn a full-time income from the business, sign contracts, or recruit workers, you need to establish a business structure and register with your state. Understanding Business Structures
If you've ever worked, rented a home, or purchased a car, you've probably signed a contract in which you acted as yourself.

Advantages of a Corporation
In addition to the limited liability protection enjoyed by shareholders, a corporation offers many other advantages over other types of entities:
- Ownership interests in the business are freely transferable:
the ready transferability of shares in the corporation facilitates estate planning;
- Shares of the company may be sold to investors in order to raise capital;
- Corporations, to a much greater extent sole proprietorships and partnerships, may take advantage of pension plans, medical payment plans, group life and accident plans, and other fringe benefits available under the Internal Revenue Code. - A corporation exists forever, so long as corporate regulations are met. There is no need to cease operations if a shareholder, director, or officer dies. How a Corporation is Taxed: C and S Corporations
A ""for-profit"" corporation may be taxed in one of two ways: under Subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code (a ""C"" Corporation) or under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code (an ""S"" Corporation). A corporation taxed at the entity level is known as a C corporation. Income that has been taxed at the entity level will again be taxed if, and when, is distributed as dividends to shareholders. This double taxation is, perhaps, the single greatest disadvantage to operating a business as a corporation. However, S Corporations may avoid much of this double taxation. Requirements for S Corporation Election
To elect to be treated as an S Corporation, certain requirements must be met and an election form must be filed with the IRS. The main requirements are:
- There may be no more than 100 shareholders;
- Only one class of stock is permitted;
- Shareholders must be individuals , estates, or certain types of trusts, and must not be nonresident aliens;
If a corporation elects to be taxed as an S Corporation and meets the requirements, it will be taxed at the federal level very similarly to partnerships and limited liability companies. That is, the income, losses, and gains will be passed through directly to the shareholders and there will be no tax ""at the entity level."" What is an LLC or Limited Liability Company? A limited liability company, or LLC, may be formed by one or more owners, called members. It provides members with limited liability protection for their personal assets in most cases, just as a corporation does for its shareholders. It also offers the members with ""pass-through"" taxation like a sole proprietorship or partnership, avoiding the potential of double taxation in a C Corporation. How to Form an LLC
Like a corporation, an LLC is formed at the state level by filing Articles of Organization with the Secretary of State. For a single member LLC, this is essentially all that is required to begin operating a business as an LLC. If the LLC has two or more members, they will need to enter into an operating agreement, similar to a partnership agreement, which should be in writing. This often requires the expertise of an attorney to be properly prepared, and adds to the cost of forming an LLC. Owners and Management in an LLC
An LLC may have an unlimited number of owners and there are no restrictions on the type of persons who may be owners. One of the main advantages of an LLC over a corporation is the greater flexibility in the management of the business. An LLC may be managed in the following ways:
- solely by its members;
- by one or more managers;
- by its members and officers. Though an LLC and an S Corporation are both ""pass-through"" tax entities, an LLC is not subject to the requirements that must be met in order to be an S corporation. There are no restrictions on the type of persons who may be members in an LLC. The LLC may have an unlimited number of members, and the LLC may have more than one class of equity interest. Further, an LLC, unlike an S Corporation, may provide for allocations of profits, losses, and distributions disproportionate to the percentage of equity interest held in the LLC. Disadvantages of an LLC
Compared to a corporation, an LLC is a less favorable entity choice as far as raising capital from outside investors or offering ownership interests to employees. The corporation structure has been in existence far longer than the LLC and is better understood with respect to its structure and how ownership interests are represented in stock certificates. These characteristics have less certainty and may be more difficult to comprehend in an LLC because of the potential complexity of an LLC operating agreement. What Are the Types of Partnerships?

So, it is a separate legal entity with rights and responsibilities of its own. It has its own tax ID, whatever. The other option would be a limited liability company. So, a limited liability company is a creature of the state. So essentially whether you’re going to form a C Corp or an LLC, the processes are the same. You tend to go; you need to choose what state you’re gonna incorporate. And that would be not just, I know everyone rushes for Delaware because of the brand name recognition, presumably, but I would recommend that some more thought be given, especially if you’re going to do business in the US and if you’re going to have any US Nexus, chances are, you may want to consider whether you’re going to form that initial entity in the state, in which you would trigger some sort of connection. But anyway, let’s just talk generally. So an LLC, it’s called a limited liability company, but you can make an election for it to be treated like a C Corp. If you don’t make that election, the default is that it’s a pass through. So it’s kind of like a hybrid entity. So the equivalent in Singapore, if I had to, I’d say, it’s like, if it’s a single member, LLC, so there’s just like one person who owns, it will be like a sole proprietorship. If more than one person owns it, it’ll be treated like the Singapore equivalent of a limited liability partnership or an LLP. So that’s what an LLC is. What’s the difference? One is passed through. So, the income that the LLC earned is not taxable in the hands of the LLC. So the difference is tax. It’s actually taxable in the hands of the members of the LLC, whether it’s you guys as individuals, or if you may hold your membership in that LLC via a Singapore entity, for example, or BVI or some other structures. So, it will be taxable in the hands of whoever’s behind the LLC, not the LLC. Whereas a C Corp, it’s taxable in the hands of the C Corp. It does get a bit more involved in it, but that tends to be the key difference. The C Corp is viewed as a more formal structure. And if it is, especially if you want to bring in their property investors, they tend to prefer C Corp. When I say formal, I mean that the compliance burden is slightly higher and that, you know, I mean, either way, you’d want to make sure that everything, you know, you do meetings and meetings are minuted. You have a separate bank account, you know, all the normal, let’s say financial hygiene that you want to exercise in running an entity would apply in either of them. But the bar slightly higher and when it comes to C Corp. In addition to it, a C Corp is subject to double tax of the income. What do I mean by that? So, when the company earns a profit, it files its own return to C Corp. It files its own return, pays corporate tax at 21%, and then, the dividends can be extracted by the shareholders. And when the shareholders received those returns, it is often subject to taxes as well. So the income is being taxed twice, one in the hands of the company, and then with dividends extracted is going to be taxed again in the hands of the shareholders. Whereas when it’s an LLC, the LLC doesn’t pay tax, only the members behind it. So I hope that helps, but I would normally say that in order to make a recommendation, we would need to understand the business model inside out. So, that’s where having a better idea of what your main objectives and the nature of the structure of the businesses, the business, et cetera. Basically, see a pitch deck or business plan that will help us advise accordingly. So those are my thoughts on C Corp versus LLC. Part C. So this person had like four parts, right? So A, B, C, and D. C what are the tax implications or tax obligations? Well… It depends, right? So remember we’re saying that if you have no Nexus in the US, everything is going to be taxable by IRS and Singapore. Right? But let’s put that to one side and let’s say that, you know, you do have, you do trigger some sort of presence in the US. I think everyone is well familiar with the direct taxes. So you’re familiar with corporate taxes.","[{'passage': ""When conceptualizing a new venture, this decision is seldom given the thought and consideration it deserves. Start your business the right way by addressing this first. By Michael F. O'Keefe\nWHETHER SETTING UP YOUR BUSINESS as a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company (LLC), S-Corporation, or C-Corporation, it is vital to understand, not only the filing and paperwork requirements, but also the different tax implications that are present with each type of business structure. Commonly, owner-operated small businesses are set up as sole proprietorships due to the simplicity of the filings and regulation, as well as the single-layer tax impact on the revenues of the business. This type of ownership also allows the owner to be his or her own boss. However, owners should be extremely cautious when dealing as a sole proprietor or in a general partnership. These two types of business structures allow for all of the liabilities of the business to be shared with the individual owners on a personal level. As such, unlimited liability can be scary. Just remember to hope for the best but plan for the worst. Don’t choose a business structure based on the ease and convenience of setting it up. It is more common than one would think to have business situations end in lawsuits resulting in general partners and sole proprietors being sued personally and losing homes, cars and savings accounts. There are plenty of hurdles that these types of business owners have to overcome. Management can be difficult with limited participants and there is commonly a very overwhelming time commitment associated with this type of business. There are two types of members in a partnership: a general partner and a limited partner. General partners have unlimited liability and they are typically managers of the company. Limited partners have exactly what you would think: limited liability. They, also, usually do not have a role managing the company. Just remember, no matter how well the individual partners get along, one of the most common issues with partnerships is the disagreements that arise between members. This sometimes leads to unfortunate falling-outs between friends. Most successful types of businesses are corporations—either limited liability companies, conventional corporations (C-Corps), or S-Corporations. These three forms of business ownership comprise approximately 80% of all sales in the United States and they all share two major benefits; the first being that they have limited liability, and the second, they usually qualify for special tax advantages that other types of business ownerships do not. Incorporating a business is a great strategy as it allows for the company to grow, it has perpetual life, ownership can change hands easily, and it’s common for corporations to be able to afford talented employees. However, as a sword can cut both ways, there are some disadvantages to incorporating a business. Corporations are more costly to start, they require more paperwork, possible conflicts with other owners and board members can arise, and they are also affected by double taxation, which means that the business’ profits will be taxed, as well as the shareholders’ dividends. A special type of incorporation is called an S-Corporation. Aside from sharing the benefit of limited liability, this type of corporation has a major difference from a conventional C-Corporation: It has much simpler taxes, called ‘single taxation,’ that are similar to that of a partnership. Downsides of incorporating as an S-Corporation include ineligibility for a dividends received deduction, and that S-Corps are not subject to the 10% of taxable income limitation that are applicable to charitable contribution deductions. Choosing the best type of business is a personal choice, albeit one that shouldn’t be taken lightly. The prospected longevity, growth and future development of the business should be taken into serious consideration before the choice to incorporate is made."", 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:188d93e4-153f-4ec4-ba2c-91dce1e33bb5>']}, {'passage': 'When it comes to setting up corporate structures there are a variety of considerations to bear in mind. There are both commercial and tax implications that need to be considered. The adage that the tax tail should not wag the commercial dog is very true in these situations. However, one of the main commercial considerations in determining the best structure for the business is actually to consider the tax implications, as they will have a big impact on the financials for the business. Setting up a Limited company:\nA Limited company structure provides important protection due to the ""limited liability"" characteristic of companies. By being a Limited liability company it means that the shareholders are protected from loss of their own personal assets. Another advantage of Limited company status is the current favourable taxation treatment of companies compared with sole traders/individuals. Some problems inherent with a Limited liability structure include that the structure is rather rigid in that incoming or exiting shareholders will have various implications for the business - and there will be taxation implications on the disposal of shares or ""company buy back"" of shares. Limited Liability Partnerships:\nLimited liability partnerships allow for greater flexibility in that profits sharing ratios can be changed dependant on private agreements of the Partners. The main constituational document of the partnership will be the partnership agreement. This will control the way in which the partnership interacts and behaves with its members and the way in which business is conducted by the partnership. An LLP is tax transparent and therefore the taxation of the profits of the partnership fall onto the ""members"" of the LLP. There are a variety of benefits in setting up a corporate group structure - either at the inception of the business or at a future point in time.

That shift has reduced federal revenues but probably promoted overall investment and a more efficient allocation of resources. Most business receipts—the revenues that businesses receive from sales of goods and services—come from a relatively small number of firms subject to the corporate income tax, called C corporations. However, other organizational forms allow businesses to avoid the corporate tax by passing their profits through to their owners, where they are subject to the individual income tax. Use of those pass-through structures has grown: In 1980, 83 percent of firms passed profits through to their owners for taxation, and they accounted for 14 percent of business receipts; by 2007, those shares had increased to 94 percent and 38 percent, respectively.

The legal and accounting costs of setting up an S corporation are also similar to those for a regular corporation. Another major difference between a regular corporation and an S corporation is that S corporations can only issue one class of stock. Experts say this can hamper the company’s ability to raise capital. In addition, unlike in a regular corporation, S corporation stock can only be owned by individuals, estates and certain types of trusts. In 1998, tax-exempt organizations such as qualified pension plans were added to the list. This change provides S corporations with even greater access to capital because a number of pension plans are willing to invest in closely held small-business stock. Putting Inc. to Paper\nTo start the process of incorporating, contact the secretary of state or the state office that's responsible for registering corporations in your state. Ask for instructions, forms and fee schedules on incorporating. It's possible to file for incorporation without the help of an attorney by using books and software to guide you. Your expense will be the cost of these resources, the filing fees and other costs associated with incorporating in your state. If you do it yourself, you'll save the expense of using a lawyer, which can cost from $500 to $5,000 if you choose a firm that specializes in startup businesses. The disadvantage is that the process may take you some time to accomplish. There is also a chance you could miss some small but important detail in your state’s law. One of the first steps in the incorporation process is to prepare a certificate or articles of incorporation. Some states provide a printed form for this, which either you or your attorney can complete. The corporation will also need a set of bylaws that describe in greater detail than the articles how the corporation will run, including the responsibilities of the company’s shareholders, directors and officers; when stockholder meetings will be held; and other details important to running the company. Once your articles of incorporation are accepted, the secretary of state’s office will send you a certificate of incorporation. Laying the Foundation\nWhen making a decision about which business structure to use, answering the following questions should help you narrow down which entity is right for you:\n- How many owners will your company have, and what will their roles be? - Are you concerned about the tax consequences of your business structure? - Do you want to consider having employees become owners in the company? - Can you deal with the added costs that come with selecting a complicated business structure? - How much paperwork are you prepared to deal with? - Do you want to make all the decisions in the company? - Are you planning to go public? - Do you want to protect your personal resources from debts or other claims against your company? - Are family succession issues a concern? Even after you settle on a business structure, remember that the circumstances that make one type of business organization favorable are always subject to changes in the laws. It makes sense to reassess your form of business from time to time to make sure you are using the one that provides the most benefits."", 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:f791fc24-a91f-4e4c-b822-b5316b13faa9>']}, {'passage': ""If you've been in business for a while as a sole proprietor, you may be wondering whether it would be a good idea to incorporate. We can help you make that decision with information on: why a business owner would want to incorporate, how a corporation is structured, and how corporations are taxed. Reasons for incorporating\nPicture this: You started a small landscaping business a few years ago as a sole proprietorship with three employees. Demand was so great for your services that you kept hiring more people and taking on debt to purchase more equipment, and the number of customers has soared. But lately you've started to wonder: What happens if business slows and you can't pay back all the debt? What if a disgruntled employee or unhappy customer sues you? As a sole proprietor you're personally liable for any bad debts and legal judgments against your business, meaning that your home and other personal assets are likely at risk. When you incorporate, you're creating a completely separate legal entity, one that can shoulder the liability burden you had been carrying yourself (or if you are a partnership, the burden you and the other partners were carrying). Forming a corporation also allows you to:\n- Reward and retain key staff by giving workers a piece of the business. - Have more options for raising funds. Instead of going into more debt, you can attract equity investors. - Shift tax liability away from you to the corporate entity. But you'll have to weigh some disadvantages as well:\n- It usually takes more time and money to incorporate than to form other types of businesses. - Corporations typically are subject to more regulation at both the federal and state level, and the tax rules can be more complicated. - The management structure of a corporation is usually more rigid, often giving you, as the owner, less flexibility to run things as you see fit. Typically, a corporation has a three-tiered structure, which consists of:\n- Shareholders: As company owners, they are the linchpins of the corporation. They often have the power to select and remove directors, amend bylaws, approve the sale of assets and dissolve the corporation. You don't necessarily have to have a lot of shareholders. In fact, most states permit one person to hold 100% of the corporation's stock. - Directors: They act on behalf of the stockholders, managing the company, making major decisions about the firm's direction and electing company officers. Most states allow corporations to have a single director, but some require a minimum of three. - Officers: In most states, corporations must have at least a president, secretary and treasurer to handle day-to-day running of the business, but many states also allow one person to hold all three positions. Steps to becoming a corporation\nTo get your corporation started, you'll need to draw up Articles of Incorporation in the state where your business is headquartered. The articles declare basic facts about the company, including its name, purpose and the number of shares authorized. You file this document with the appropriate state office (usually the Secretary of State or Department of Commerce) and pay a filing fee, which can be as much as several hundred dollars. You may want to hire an attorney to handle the process. Most states will process your filing and send you a Certificate of Incorporation. With your Certificate in hand, you can take the next steps, including appointing directors and holding your first directors' meeting. You'll need to draw up bylaws, which detail the rights of the shareholders, directors and officers. You also must issue stock. It doesn't have to be widely-held, but generally must be distributed to everyone who is an owner of the corporation. Tax issues for corporations\nOnce you have incorporated, you'll probably notice a big difference in how your company is treated for tax purposes. You'll no longer file Schedule C and report your net profit or loss on your 1040. Instead, the corporation files a business tax return, Form 1120, and if it is a C-Corp, pays tax on its corporate profits. Many owners of new, small corporations may get a pleasant surprise at tax time. That's because sole proprietors can't deduct any salaries they pay themselves, but after incorporating they become employees, and their compensation can be written off by the corporate entity. Once those and other deductions are taken, there may be little corporate profit left to tax."", 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:83eceb1e-5134-454e-a3a1-e7b909f9ee7f>']}, {'passage': ""An S corporation owner who works for the company must be paid a reasonable income and must pay tax and FICA on that amount. This tax status prevents double taxation because S corporation profits are dispersed to shareholders. Another benefit of S corporation status is that a S corp owner can deduct 20% of his or her share of business income from his or her taxes, in addition to the typical deductions for business expenses. The owner's income as an employee is used to compute the Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction. Personal service firms such as accountancy, law, consulting, and financial services are not eligible for this deduction. Furthermore, for higher-income business owners, the QBI deduction is limited or unavailable. Using IRS Form 8832\nEntity Classification Election to be taxed as a corporation. The choice to be taxed as a new entity takes effect on the date provided on line 8 of Form 8832. The election cannot take effect more than 75 days before or after the filing date, and it cannot take effect more than 12 months after the filing date. A consent statement is included in the form 8832, which can be signed by all members or by one person on behalf of all members. If only one person signs, there should be a record in the company membership meetings that this election was approved by all members, form 8832. You must supply the names of the owners as well as the number(s) of owners (Social Security Number for a single-member LLC, and Employer ID Number for multiple member LLC). Use IRS Form 2553 - Election by a Small Business Corporation to be taxed as a S Corporation. You must file by March 15 for the new tax classification to take effect for the entire year. You'll need to include information on each shareholder, such as their name and address, the number of shares they own, their Social Security number, the end of their tax year, and a consent statement. The LLC's Tax Benefits\nAvoids Double Taxation\nThe LLC owner is not subject to double taxes, which is a benefit over corporations. A corporation pays corporate taxes, while the corporation's owners are shareholders who pay taxes on dividends received. Corporations are subject to double taxation, which means that the corporation pays income taxes and shareholders pay dividend taxes. Corporate Franchise Tax Can Be Avoided\nCorporations must pay state corporate franchise taxes in some states, but LLCs are not required to do so in others. This varies widely by state, so check with your state's tax department to see what they require. Small Business Owner Tax Deductions\nLLC owners and other small business owners can now take advantage of a new deduction not accessible to corporation shareholders. It's known as the Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction, and it allows LLC owners to deduct 20% of their net income in addition to their standard business cost deductions. The LLC's Tax Disadvantages\nLLC members are required to pay taxes on their distributive part of the company's profits, even if they have not received a distribution of those profits. Profits are not taxed unless they are given to shareholders, usually in the form of dividends. Taxes Due on Self-Employment\nSelf-employment taxes (Social Security/Medicare) also hurt LLC owners hard. While corporation employees pay half of the self-employment tax and the company pays the other half, the LLC owner pays both employer and employee amounts. What is the definition of a business structure? A business structure is a form of legal structure for a company. It's critical to take your time when beginning a new firm to choose the correct sort of business entity. The business structure you choose has little impact on the day-to-day operations of your company, but it is critical for identifying ownership, minimising personal liability, managing business taxes, and planning for future expansion. Business entities, at their most basic level, establish the company as a legal entity capable of having bank accounts, entering into contracts, and conducting business without having to do it in your personal name. Working under your own name may be fine for some very small firms, but if you expect to earn a full-time income from the business, sign contracts, or recruit workers, you need to establish a business structure and register with your state. Understanding Business Structures\nIf you've ever worked, rented a home, or purchased a car, you've probably signed a contract in which you acted as yourself."", 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:38a500a4-36e7-45d7-9625-e906a4ee117e>']}, {'passage': 'Advantages of a Corporation\nIn addition to the limited liability protection enjoyed by shareholders, a corporation offers many other advantages over other types of entities:\n- Ownership interests in the business are freely transferable:\nthe ready transferability of shares in the corporation facilitates estate planning;\n- Shares of the company may be sold to investors in order to raise capital;\n- Corporations, to a much greater extent sole proprietorships and partnerships, may take advantage of pension plans, medical payment plans, group life and accident plans, and other fringe benefits available under the Internal Revenue Code. - A corporation exists forever, so long as corporate regulations are met. There is no need to cease operations if a shareholder, director, or officer dies. How a Corporation is Taxed: C and S Corporations\nA ""for-profit"" corporation may be taxed in one of two ways: under Subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code (a ""C"" Corporation) or under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code (an ""S"" Corporation). A corporation taxed at the entity level is known as a C corporation. Income that has been taxed at the entity level will again be taxed if, and when, is distributed as dividends to shareholders. This double taxation is, perhaps, the single greatest disadvantage to operating a business as a corporation. However, S Corporations may avoid much of this double taxation. Requirements for S Corporation Election\nTo elect to be treated as an S Corporation, certain requirements must be met and an election form must be filed with the IRS. The main requirements are:\n- There may be no more than 100 shareholders;\n- Only one class of stock is permitted;\n- Shareholders must be individuals , estates, or certain types of trusts, and must not be nonresident aliens;\nIf a corporation elects to be taxed as an S Corporation and meets the requirements, it will be taxed at the federal level very similarly to partnerships and limited liability companies. That is, the income, losses, and gains will be passed through directly to the shareholders and there will be no tax ""at the entity level."" What is an LLC or Limited Liability Company? A limited liability company, or LLC, may be formed by one or more owners, called members. It provides members with limited liability protection for their personal assets in most cases, just as a corporation does for its shareholders. It also offers the members with ""pass-through"" taxation like a sole proprietorship or partnership, avoiding the potential of double taxation in a C Corporation. How to Form an LLC\nLike a corporation, an LLC is formed at the state level by filing Articles of Organization with the Secretary of State. For a single member LLC, this is essentially all that is required to begin operating a business as an LLC. If the LLC has two or more members, they will need to enter into an operating agreement, similar to a partnership agreement, which should be in writing. This often requires the expertise of an attorney to be properly prepared, and adds to the cost of forming an LLC. Owners and Management in an LLC\nAn LLC may have an unlimited number of owners and there are no restrictions on the type of persons who may be owners. One of the main advantages of an LLC over a corporation is the greater flexibility in the management of the business. An LLC may be managed in the following ways:\n- solely by its members;\n- by one or more managers;\n- by its members and officers. Though an LLC and an S Corporation are both ""pass-through"" tax entities, an LLC is not subject to the requirements that must be met in order to be an S corporation. There are no restrictions on the type of persons who may be members in an LLC. The LLC may have an unlimited number of members, and the LLC may have more than one class of equity interest. Further, an LLC, unlike an S Corporation, may provide for allocations of profits, losses, and distributions disproportionate to the percentage of equity interest held in the LLC. Disadvantages of an LLC\nCompared to a corporation, an LLC is a less favorable entity choice as far as raising capital from outside investors or offering ownership interests to employees. The corporation structure has been in existence far longer than the LLC and is better understood with respect to its structure and how ownership interests are represented in stock certificates. These characteristics have less certainty and may be more difficult to comprehend in an LLC because of the potential complexity of an LLC operating agreement. What Are the Types of Partnerships?', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:320c5d58-78a0-4ae1-9c10-12cbe56d064e>']}, {'passage': 'So, it is a separate legal entity with rights and responsibilities of its own. It has its own tax ID, whatever. The other option would be a limited liability company. So, a limited liability company is a creature of the state. So essentially whether you’re going to form a C Corp or an LLC, the processes are the same. You tend to go; you need to choose what state you’re gonna incorporate. And that would be not just, I know everyone rushes for Delaware because of the brand name recognition, presumably, but I would recommend that some more thought be given, especially if you’re going to do business in the US and if you’re going to have any US Nexus, chances are, you may want to consider whether you’re going to form that initial entity in the state, in which you would trigger some sort of connection. But anyway, let’s just talk generally. So an LLC, it’s called a limited liability company, but you can make an election for it to be treated like a C Corp. If you don’t make that election, the default is that it’s a pass through. So it’s kind of like a hybrid entity. So the equivalent in Singapore, if I had to, I’d say, it’s like, if it’s a single member, LLC, so there’s just like one person who owns, it will be like a sole proprietorship. If more than one person owns it, it’ll be treated like the Singapore equivalent of a limited liability partnership or an LLP. So that’s what an LLC is. What’s the difference? One is passed through. So, the income that the LLC earned is not taxable in the hands of the LLC. So the difference is tax. It’s actually taxable in the hands of the members of the LLC, whether it’s you guys as individuals, or if you may hold your membership in that LLC via a Singapore entity, for example, or BVI or some other structures. So, it will be taxable in the hands of whoever’s behind the LLC, not the LLC. Whereas a C Corp, it’s taxable in the hands of the C Corp. It does get a bit more involved in it, but that tends to be the key difference. The C Corp is viewed as a more formal structure. And if it is, especially if you want to bring in their property investors, they tend to prefer C Corp. When I say formal, I mean that the compliance burden is slightly higher and that, you know, I mean, either way, you’d want to make sure that everything, you know, you do meetings and meetings are minuted. You have a separate bank account, you know, all the normal, let’s say financial hygiene that you want to exercise in running an entity would apply in either of them. But the bar slightly higher and when it comes to C Corp. In addition to it, a C Corp is subject to double tax of the income. What do I mean by that? So, when the company earns a profit, it files its own return to C Corp. It files its own return, pays corporate tax at 21%, and then, the dividends can be extracted by the shareholders. And when the shareholders received those returns, it is often subject to taxes as well. So the income is being taxed twice, one in the hands of the company, and then with dividends extracted is going to be taxed again in the hands of the shareholders. Whereas when it’s an LLC, the LLC doesn’t pay tax, only the members behind it. So I hope that helps, but I would normally say that in order to make a recommendation, we would need to understand the business model inside out. So, that’s where having a better idea of what your main objectives and the nature of the structure of the businesses, the business, et cetera. Basically, see a pitch deck or business plan that will help us advise accordingly. So those are my thoughts on C Corp versus LLC. Part C. So this person had like four parts, right? So A, B, C, and D. C what are the tax implications or tax obligations? Well… It depends, right? So remember we’re saying that if you have no Nexus in the US, everything is going to be taxable by IRS and Singapore. Right? But let’s put that to one side and let’s say that, you know, you do have, you do trigger some sort of presence in the US. I think everyone is well familiar with the direct taxes. So you’re familiar with corporate taxes.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:adbfb368-f19f-46bd-bb69-c6d9098241ce>']}]","{

All taxes, including business activity taxes, are \u201cpeople taxes\u201d and have an economic impact.3 min read\nBusiness taxation is important to understand. All taxes, including business activity taxes, are \u201cpeople taxes\u201d and have an economic impact. Since only people can pay taxes, the tax burden ultimately falls on various groups of people. Business taxes include corporate franchise tax, employment tax, excise tax, gross receipts tax, and value added tax, VAT. How Are Applicable Taxes Determined? All firms must pay certain taxes, including:\n- Sales tax\nThe type of business a person owns will determine additional taxes they may pay. For example, insurance, mining and petroleum extraction companies are required to pay additional taxes specifically related to their industries. It is not uncommon for firms to pay a fee for doing business in a particular jurisdiction. What Is a Value-Added Tax? A value-added tax, VAT, also referred to as a goods and service tax is a consumption tax that is placed or assessed incrementally. The amount is based on the increase in value of the good or service at each stage, from production to point of sale. It avoids the double taxation of a direct sales tax because the producer or distributor does not get burdened with the tax. The end consumer ultimately catches the full brunt of the tax. Choosing the Returns You Must File\nThere are several return types and the one you file depends on your business structure. Sole proprietors and any other business structure with a pass-through structure file Form 1040. A pass-through structure allows owners to report business and expenses as part of their personal tax return. If you operate as a C corporation you will submit a copy of the 1120 Form and S corporations will submit the 1120s Form. Both nonprofit organizations and general partnerships will use information returns. Nonprofit organizations will use the 990 Form and general partnerships will use 1065 Form. Business-related returns will vary and may include sales and usage tax, payroll taxes and other specific state and local taxes. Also, the Form 1040-ES will include the estimated tax payments. Again, the tax rates will vary depending on the business structure you operate under and the type of business you have. Sole proprietors will file their return and face normal federal income tax rates on any revenue they generate through their self-employment. These rates can go as high as 39.6% and as low as 10%. This is also applicable to any business owner with a pass-through business structure, such as S corporations and partnerships. Take note, this does not include the 15.3 self-employment tax you may be subject too, nor any state or local taxes. Do All Businesses Incur a Corporate Income Tax? It is most likely that you will incur a corporate income tax if you operate as a C corporation or an LLC. This is based on the amount your corporation earns and essentially, the more you earn the more you pay in taxes. Tax rates start at 15% and go up to as high as 39%. Depending on where you conduct your business, you may have state and local corporate taxes as well. Tax Advantages for Businesses\nA big advantage at tax time for business owners is the opportunity to deduct every single business-related expense. Of course, individuals do not get to write off near as many deductions. For example, as a business owner, you can deduct 50% of any business-related meals and entertainment. In addition, vehicle expenses, home office expenses are all eligible deductions if they are in some way related to your business. This means your deductions can range from paper clips to high-powered computer servers as long as you document and keep your receipts to prove your deductions at tax time. Responsibility to Pay Taxes\nConversely, being your own boss and having huge deductions also comes with having a huge amount of responsibility. You are required to make sure your local, state, and federal taxes are submitted and paid in a timely manner, along with withholding taxes from employee's wages. In addition, you are responsible for preparing and filing a W-2 form for each employee. On top of all the tax responsibilities, you must comply with federal and state business license laws as well. There are a great many advantages for business owners as long as owners are willing to adapt to the roles and responsibilities that come with a successful thriving business.

                ""text"": ""Over the past 30 years, the activity of businesses that are subject to the individual income tax has grown compared with that of businesses subject to the corporate income tax. That shift has reduced federal revenues but probably promoted overall investment and a more efficient allocation of resources. Most business receipts\u2014the revenues that businesses receive from sales of goods and services\u2014come from a relatively small number of firms subject to the corporate income tax, called C corporations. However, other organizational forms allow businesses to avoid the corporate tax by passing their profits through to their owners, where they are subject to the individual income tax. Use of those pass-through structures has grown: In 1980, 83 percent of firms passed profits through to their owners for taxation, and they accounted for 14 percent of business receipts; by 2007, those shares had increased to 94 percent and 38 percent, respectively. Organizational forms that provide owners with the same protection from liability for the debts of the firm that the owners of C corporations receive were almost entirely responsible for that growth. Today\u2019s CBO report Taxing Businesses Through the Individual Income Tax examines the size and causes of the shift in organizational structure, the effect it has had on federal revenues, and the potential effects on revenues and investment of various alternative approaches to taxing businesses\u2019 profits.

This offers financial security and emotional freedom to focus on recovery.,"Critical illness insurance, also known as critical illness cover, is a type of health insurance policy designed to provide financial support in the event of a serious illness. This coverage is particularly useful for helping policyholders manage the costs associated with treatment and recovery, as well as the potential loss of income due to a prolonged absence from work.

### How It Works:

1. **Policy Purchase**: Individuals purchase a critical illness insurance policy from an insurance provider. The policy specifies the conditions or illnesses covered, the benefit amount, and the duration of the benefit payout.

2. **Diagnosis and Notification**: If the policyholder is diagnosed with a covered illness, they must notify the insurance company within a specified time frame, often within 30 days of diagnosis.

3. **Claim Assessment**: The insurance company will assess the claim to ensure the illness meets the policy's criteria. This process may involve reviewing medical reports and possibly conducting an independent medical examination.

4. **Benefit Payment**: If the claim is approved, the policyholder receives a lump sum payment. This money can be used for various purposes, such as covering medical expenses, paying off debts, or assisting with living expenses during recovery.

### Benefits Provided:

1. **Financial Relief**: The primary benefit is the financial support received upon diagnosis, which can help alleviate the financial burden of treatment and recovery.

2. **Income Replacement**: Critical illness cover can provide a replacement income if the policyholder is unable to work due to their illness, helping to maintain their standard of living.

3. **Flexibility in Use**: The lump sum payment is usually flexible and can be used by the policyholder as they see fit, whether for medical expenses, home modifications, or other personal needs.

4. **Peace of Mind**: Knowing that there is a safety net in place in the event of a serious illness can provide peace of mind for policyholders and their families.

5. **Complementary to Other Insurance**: Critical illness cover often complements other forms of health insurance, such as medical insurance or disability insurance, by addressing gaps in coverage or providing additional benefits.

It's important for individuals considering critical illness insurance to carefully review policy terms, including the list of covered illnesses, benefit amounts, and any exclusions or waiting periods. This will ensure the policy meets their specific needs and provides the necessary support in case of a critical illness.","You are a helpful assistant.

### Context: Lifestyle diseases are ailments, which occur due to your way of living. These include obesity, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, stroke, and heart diseases. Along with adults, many children also suffer from lifestyle disorders. Lack of physical activities, stressful living, and availability of technological resources are the main reasons for such ailments. Diet and exercise tips to follow
Today, most people live sedentary lifestyles and sit at their desks for several hours a day. Ideally, you must be physically active and sit only while resting. Sitting continuously in front of your laptop, television, or while driving affects the body in many ways, like:
- Weight gain, as you burn lesser calories
- Hormonal imbalances
- Loss of muscle strength and bone weakening
- Weakened immunity
- Lower blood circulation
Here are some tips to reduce the risk of lifestyle-related diseases:
- Remain active
- Walk around every hour and during lunch and other breaks
- Take the stairs instead of the elevator
- Exercise regularly
- Include low-intensity cardiovascular training
- Take up a sport
- Do yoga and meditation to relieve stress and anxiety
- Make dietary changes
- Eat nutritious and well-balanced meals comprising natural fats and proteins
- Avoid sugar-laden foods like sodas, candies, and pastries
- Eliminate fried and processed foods from your diet
- Drink adequate water to remain hydrated
Treatment costs for critical illness
The treatment expenses for critical illness are on the rise due to inflation. Open heart surgery or organ transplant may cost between INR 5 lakh to INR 10 lakh. Cancer treatment may cost in the range of INR 10 lakh to INR 15 lakh. Heart diseases may require INR lakh 3 to INR 5 lakh for treatment. Have you considered how you will meet these expenses in case of a diagnosis of any illness? A critical illness insurance policy is beneficial to combat these expenses. This insurance plan pays a lump sum if you are diagnosed with any covered ailment. You can utilize the money that you receive from this type of health insurance plan for treatment, household expenses, repaying debt, or any other purpose. Before you opt for health coverage, here are a few things to consider:
- You need to survive for an approximate period of 30 days from the date of diagnosis; this duration may increase or decrease depending on the kind of illness; in case of demise during this tenure, you do not get any cashless health insurance benefits
- You must know about the waiting period for pre-existing conditions; it may be up to four years, and you need to find the lowest one to ensure the availability of benefits at the earliest
- You must compare different health insurance like cholesterol medical cover and Covid-19 insurance from different insurers to find a plan that includes the highest number of critical ailments
- You must inquire about the additional facilities, such as waiver of premiums, hospital cash, and a second e-opinion of a medical practitioner with the same medical insurance plan
A critical illness plan is a fixed benefit policy and does not cover hospitalization expenses. It pays a fixed amount on a positive diagnosis after the end of the survival period. To cover hospitalization-related expenses, you may buy a mediclaim policy for additional security.

HMO Made Easy: A Quick Guide Into The Ins And Outs Of Health Maintenance OrganizationsHow do you choose the health service that suits your needs best?by Rafael Alfonso . We all know how difficult it is to run into medical issues. We have to figure out where do we go to for a hospital, face high doctor consultancy costs and numerous additional fees that occur with different types of cases (especially emergency ones). But there is a way to help yourself prepare for these types of situations through what most people know as an “HMO.”
An HMO, or health maintenance organization, acts as a service for you to access its list of available doctors and clinics and cover most (if not all) of your medical-related costs. In exchange for this service, the HMO charges a yearly premium or fee. As long as you use their list of accredited doctors and clinics, you can find your medical needs more or less covered and settled. An HMO can serve as one of the benefits for employees who work in private companies. A company may offer it as a perk by covering the whole cost of the HMO per employee (no salary deduction). Some companies even cover the HMO of at least one dependent per employee.ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW

What other parents are reading
Key terms in medical and health coverage to help understand the information above:
These are services that an individual needs that normally don’t require hospital stay and would have consultations less than 24 hours. Think of your standard consultation with your doctor where they prescribe certain medication — that is an outpatient treatment. These are services that require the individual to stay in the hospital for a period of 24 hours or more, with any additional in-hospital needs included. Inpatient services are applicable to situations in which quarantine or extended stay is required for monitoring, as well as situations where certain procedures are needed that take longer than one day to execute. These often fall under situations wherein an individual utilizes the emergency room of various hospitals. Depending on the case, these emergency visits can be covered by your medical plan.ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW
How to decide on the HMO you need
The goal of these various medical coverage plans are to make your next medical situation as easy as possible. Health insurance provides the largest amount of benefits (albeit with comparatively high premiums), and PhilHealth provides the most standard service of medical discount on a basic premium (though limited in coverage). An HMO then stands as a comprehensive medical plan that can work towards what you need the most as an individual based on cost/premium, coverage, and healthcare providers. (If you are employed and HMO is one of the benefits, the company decides of the HMO.) The cost of HMOs is varied — these prices can be as low as P500 for a year’s coverage up to P15,000 in medical consumable benefits.

Here we share few tips that can help you survive WorkCover! Dealing with your injury- especially a permanent injury- and its after-effects can be extremely stressful. Negotiating your way around a very complex WorkCover system, dealing with your employer, the WorkCover agent, rehabilitation agents, doctors, so called “independent medical examiners” and even lawyers can be mind boggling and extremely stressful! Below are a few tips and tricks that can help you survive the WorkCover nightmare!Focus on your health and recovery
Your highest priority should always be your health and to maximise your physical and/or psychological recovery.WorkCover must pay for all reasonable treatment costs. We strongly believe that the most important issue is to ensure that you are getting the best quality medical treatment possible. Related blog articles

When you are seriously injured, you will have to make many important decisions about your future. To make the right decisions it will be critical to understand as much as you possibly can about the structure of WorkCover benefits, for example, how they interact with your other employment entitlements, and what all your entitlements really are. WorkCover is an extremely complex system! The Act of Parliament which governs WorkCover alone is several hundred pages long and quite complicated. Trying to understand just what WorkCover does and does not provide is really important. There are many resources available to help you with this task. The most detailed information, apart from the Act itself, is on the WorkSafe website which contains a very detailed publication called the ‘Online Claims Manual‘. This contains detailed instructions from WorkCover to its agents on how to handle claims. It also includes very detailed information about the calculation and payment of WorkCover benefits. Remember this information is written from WorkCover’s perspective only. Nonetheless this can be a useful resource for people who want detailed information.Try to deal as best you can with WorkCover
Dealing with WorkCover and -especially- your case manager can be extremely stressful.Following a few simple guidelines can make dealing with WorkCover, and your case manager (and rehab providers) a tad easier. - The most important thing is that you keep good, written records. For example, if you want to claim travel expenses you need to submit details of all your trips to and from doctors, incl train, bus, tram, taxi and parking receipts. If there is an argument about your weekly payments because WorkCover feel you are not looking for work, keeping a record of all your attempts to obtain work can put you in a far better position. - We advice all injured workers to only communicate/correspond in writing, either via email or via letter/fax. You do have the right to refuse telephone contact and you also have the right to request that all correspondence/communications go through your legal representative, one of your doctors or an advocate. You can even put a “restraining” order on your harassing, bullying and/or intimidating case manager (see our workcover tips collection for sample letters). - It’s also very important that you keep a copy of all your documents. For example, when you receive a certificate of incapacity, the original should be provided to your employer but ensure you make a copy for your own records. - Ask under the Freedom of Information Act or the Workers Compensation Act, for a copy of all your medical reports, including independent medical examination reports. - When submitting your medical certificates ensure that you complete the section on the back of the certificate about your work activities. If you don’t it will delay your payments and the form will be sent back to you. It may also be useful to try and ensure that your certificates expire on a Saturday or Sunday to make it easier for WorkCover or your employer to calculate your weekly entitlement. This enables weekly benefits to be paid in whole weeks. - Sometimes (well dare we say “often’) the decisions that a case manager makes can be extremely frustrating. Losing your cool can backfire as you will run the risk of being type cast as difficult or as suffering from a psychological problem!

A hospice professional will respond to your inquiry within 24 hours. What specific assistance does hospice provide home-based patients? Hospice patients are cared for by a team consisting of a physician, nurse practitioner, a nurse, social workers, certified nursing assistants, clergy, therapists, and volunteers. Each one provides assistance based on his or her own area of expertise. In addition, hospices provide medications, supplies, equipment, and other services related to the terminal illness. Does hospice do anything to make death come sooner? Hospice neither hastens nor postpones dying. Just as doctors and midwives lend support and expertise during the time of child birth, hospice provides its presence and specialized knowledge during the dying process. Is hospice care covered by insurance? Hospice coverage is widely available. It is provided by Medicare nationwide, by Medicaid in 47 states, and by most private insurance providers. To be sure of coverage, families should, of course, check with their employer or health insurance provider. If the patient is eligible for Medicare, will there be any additional expense to be paid? The Medicare Hospice Benefit covers the full scope of medical and support services for a life-limiting illness. Hospice care also supports the family and loved ones of the person through a variety of services. This benefit covers almost all aspects of hospice care with little expense to the patient or family. Can a hospice patient who shows signs of recovery be returned to regular medical treatment? Certainly. If the patient’s condition improves and the disease seems to be in remission, patients can be discharged from hospice and return to aggressive therapy or go on about their daily life. If the discharged patient should later need to return to hospice care, Medicare and most private insurance will allow additional coverage for this purpose. What does the hospice admission process involve? One of the first things the hospice program will do is contact the patient’s physician to make sure he or she agrees that hospice care is appropriate for this patient at this time. (Most hospices have medical staff available to help patients who have no physician.) The patient will be asked to sign consent and insurance forms. These are similar to the forms patients sign when they enter a hospital. The form Medicare patients sign also tells how electing the Medicare hospice benefit affects other Medicare coverage. Is there any special equipment or changes I must make in my home before hospice care begins? Your hospice provider will assess your needs, recommend any equipment, and help make arrangements to obtain any necessary equipment. Often the need for equipment is minimal at first and increases as the disease progresses. In general, hospice will assist in any way it can to make home care as convenient, clean and safe as possible.

What is hospice? - Hospice is a coordinated program of palliative and supportive care with the focus on comfort care rather than curative care for those individuals diagnosed with a terminal illness. What is palliative care? - Palliative care is relief of pain: the treatment and relief of mental and physical pain without curing the causes, especially in patients suffering from a terminal illness. What does “terminally ill” mean? - A medical prognosis of approximately six months or less if the disease runs its natural course. Common examples of terminal illnesses are:
- End-stage Cardiopulmonary Conditions
- End-stage Heart Disease
- End-stage Lung Disease
- End-stage Liver Disease
- End-stage Renal Disease
- Cancer (All Types)
- Neurological Conditions
- ALS (Lou Gehrig’s Disease)
- End-stage HIV/AIDS
- End-stage Dementia
- End-stage Alzheimer’s Disease
- Other Disorders/Diagnoses
How is hospice care paid for? - Medicare Part A
- Most commercial and private insurance companies
We view each situation as unique and will review the benefit plan with you individually in order to maximize your hospice benefit and insurance coverage. What is covered under the hospice program? - Staff services including nurses, social workers, physicians, chaplains, hospice aides, volunteers, etc. - Medications related to the hospice diagnosis as well as comfort medications
- Durable Medical Equipment (DME) such as wheelchairs, walkers and oxygen, as they pertain to terminal illness
- Medical supplies such as catheters and bandages, as they pertain to terminal illness
- Many additional services including bereavement and counseling services
Will I have to change doctors? - We believe that a continued relationship with your primary care physician is important; therefore, the patient or family member may choose to continue their physician relationship or have one of our specialized hospice physicians oversee your care. How long can I remain on hospice? - The hospice benefit will continue to cover palliative and comfort care for an individual with a terminal illness for an initial 90-day period, a subsequent 90-day period, and indefinite subsequent 60-day periods as determined by the hospice medical director, and as long as you continue to meet the requirements of the hospice benefit. Will I have to stop all of my medications? - Our hospice views each case individually. We will work with your physician and pharmacy to determine which medications we will cover under the Medicare Hospice Benefit, which ones will be covered under your Part D plan, and which medications are determined to be no longer medically necessary and if continued, would become the financial responsibility of the patient. How will hospice manage my pain? - Our hospice team works with the patient and family to determine the needs for pain management. Each situation is individualized, with the goal being to provide the most effective pain relief. Do I have to stay home all the time? - You do not have to be homebound to receive hospice services. We encourage our patients to enjoy life as much as possible. Does hospice provide sitters? - The hospice benefit does not include sitters. The hospice may provide volunteers to stay with you for short periods of time if appropriate. Our hospice can provide you with a variety of resources listing sitter agencies who may be of service to you. The sitters are not employees of the hospice agency and therefore are not the responsibility of the hospice agency. If I live in a nursing home, can I receive hospice care? - Yes, our hospice provides hospice care where ever you live. This includes home, independent living facilities, assisted living facilities and nursing homes. Is it necessary that I have a DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) Order to receive hospice? - It is not necessary to have a DNR; however, our hospice will work with the patient and family to obtain a LaPOST, a living will, power of attorney and/or DNR, as necessary. When is it time to get hospice? - It is time for hospice when all measures to cure the patient of the terminal illness have been exhausted and when the physician declares the patient has a prognosis of six months or less, if the disease runs its natural course. You can call us and get more information at any time. Click here to CONTACT US. How do I get hospice? - Your doctor may make the referral or you can request that someone from our hospice meet with you to give you information about the hospice benefit. Once an initial meeting is established, our hospice representative may contact your physician regarding your needs and request an approval for hospice services.

When people ask me what I do, I always need to take a little time to think. Partly because STP is a mix of so many varied experiences that every week is different to the previous one, and partly because my own understanding of my specialism keeps evolving as I move through these experiences. When I first applied for this course, I thought I had a reasonable understanding of what cancer genomics was. But now I see how naive I was and that three years is not anywhere near enough time to fully comprehend this very diverse and quickly developing area of science. So summarising it all in a few paragraphs will be a challenge but… let’s give it a go! Critical Care Science in the Wider Context
Critical Care Science (CCS) is one of the smaller STP specialisms but deals with one of the most complex patient populations. Critical care patients range from elective cardiac surgery patients to major trauma and acute/chronic medical conditions. Critical care refers to specialised care for patients with life-threatening conditions; typically compromising of one or more organs that are failing. This level of care may be delivered in A+E, Intensive Care, High Dependency or specialist wards, e.g. long term ventilation. While a lot of the STP specialisms focus on a particular organ system or on a particular grouping of investigative techniques, the skills of CCS cover a holistic approach to clinical care, incorporating all areas of medicine and technology. Genetic counsellors see individuals and families to discuss genetic conditions that are present, or are thought to be present, in their family. Information about an individual’s personal medical history and their family history is taken into account when determining the likelihood of a genetic condition running in a family.

Learning to live with a chronic illness is an exhausting challenge for everyone involved. From diagnosis until either the illness resolves or the client’s life ends, that individual and family must make every decision and every move with the chronic illness in mind. ;
The social worker’s role is many times fairly limited. It is often a matter of following the client and seeing that their basic needs are being met. At times, it does take on the role of sleuth when the social worker is able to go in search of resources to help pay for special needs for everything from prostheses to new treatments. At the very least, it is to help the client and their family to hold on to hope. Interview an individual who has a chronic illness. With the individual’s permission, interview them about what it is like to live with a chronic illness, the most difficult parts of being chronically ill, how they manage their illness, what aspects—if any—frighten them, what kind of social support and family support they have, how willing they would be to try new treatment methods, and which social worker stands out most in their mind (good or bad) and why. In a 5-6-minute video reflect on the following (Asking for a transcript not video recording):
· Describe the patient and their chronic illness. What makes it difficult? How is it managed? · How did it feel for you to talk candidly with an individual about their illness? · Who would you say was more uncomfortable talking about it—you or the person you were interviewing? · How informed was in the individual about their illness and the treatments and prognosis? · How supported did this individual feel from the community, and how did that support change from before they became ill? · What insights did you gain from this experience that you will take into the field as a social worker to help when you work with clients with chronic illnesses?

These include obesity, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, stroke, and heart diseases. Along with adults, many children also suffer from lifestyle disorders. Lack of physical activities, stressful living, and availability of technological resources are the main reasons for such ailments. Diet and exercise tips to follow\nToday, most people live sedentary lifestyles and sit at their desks for several hours a day. Ideally, you must be physically active and sit only while resting. Sitting continuously in front of your laptop, television, or while driving affects the body in many ways, like:\n- Weight gain, as you burn lesser calories\n- Hormonal imbalances\n- Loss of muscle strength and bone weakening\n- Weakened immunity\n- Lower blood circulation\nHere are some tips to reduce the risk of lifestyle-related diseases:\n- Remain active\n- Walk around every hour and during lunch and other breaks\n- Take the stairs instead of the elevator\n- Exercise regularly\n- Include low-intensity cardiovascular training\n- Take up a sport\n- Do yoga and meditation to relieve stress and anxiety\n- Make dietary changes\n- Eat nutritious and well-balanced meals comprising natural fats and proteins\n- Avoid sugar-laden foods like sodas, candies, and pastries\n- Eliminate fried and processed foods from your diet\n- Drink adequate water to remain hydrated\nTreatment costs for critical illness\nThe treatment expenses for critical illness are on the rise due to inflation. Open heart surgery or organ transplant may cost between INR 5 lakh to INR 10 lakh. Cancer treatment may cost in the range of INR 10 lakh to INR 15 lakh. Heart diseases may require INR lakh 3 to INR 5 lakh for treatment. Have you considered how you will meet these expenses in case of a diagnosis of any illness? A critical illness insurance policy is beneficial to combat these expenses. This insurance plan pays a lump sum if you are diagnosed with any covered ailment. You can utilize the money that you receive from this type of health insurance plan for treatment, household expenses, repaying debt, or any other purpose. Before you opt for health coverage, here are a few things to consider:\n- You need to survive for an approximate period of 30 days from the date of diagnosis; this duration may increase or decrease depending on the kind of illness; in case of demise during this tenure, you do not get any cashless health insurance benefits\n- You must know about the waiting period for pre-existing conditions; it may be up to four years, and you need to find the lowest one to ensure the availability of benefits at the earliest\n- You must compare different health insurance like cholesterol medical cover and Covid-19 insurance from different insurers to find a plan that includes the highest number of critical ailments\n- You must inquire about the additional facilities, such as waiver of premiums, hospital cash, and a second e-opinion of a medical practitioner with the same medical insurance plan\nA critical illness plan is a fixed benefit policy and does not cover hospitalization expenses. It pays a fixed amount on a positive diagnosis after the end of the survival period. To cover hospitalization-related expenses, you may buy a mediclaim policy for additional security.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:755f5b18-833c-48b3-a191-46baae9c64c7>']}, {'passage': ""- Toddler Parenting Experts: Play-Based Learning Muna Bago Formal Schooling\n- Toddler Is 'No' Your Toddler's Favorite Word?

We all know how difficult it is to run into medical issues. We have to figure out where do we go to for a hospital, face high doctor consultancy costs and numerous additional fees that occur with different types of cases (especially emergency ones). But there is a way to help yourself prepare for these types of situations through what most people know as an “HMO.”\nAn HMO, or health maintenance organization, acts as a service for you to access its list of available doctors and clinics and cover most (if not all) of your medical-related costs. In exchange for this service, the HMO charges a yearly premium or fee. As long as you use their list of accredited doctors and clinics, you can find your medical needs more or less covered and settled. An HMO can serve as one of the benefits for employees who work in private companies. A company may offer it as a perk by covering the whole cost of the HMO per employee (no salary deduction). Some companies even cover the HMO of at least one dependent per employee.ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nHow does this differ from health insurance or PhilHealth?CONTINUE READING BELOWRecommended Videos\nType of medical coverage: HMO\nService provider: HMO companies (Medicard, Maxicare, Pacific Cross, etc.) Estimated cost: P500 to upwards of P60,000\nStandard benefits: Outpatient, inpatient, emergency, preventive (only with accredited/associated hospitals/clinics of the HMO)\nTransmittal of financial assistance: The accredited hospital or clinic will charge your bill against the consumable limit or amount provided by the HMO.

Think of your standard consultation with your doctor where they prescribe certain medication — that is an outpatient treatment. These are services that require the individual to stay in the hospital for a period of 24 hours or more, with any additional in-hospital needs included. Inpatient services are applicable to situations in which quarantine or extended stay is required for monitoring, as well as situations where certain procedures are needed that take longer than one day to execute. These often fall under situations wherein an individual utilizes the emergency room of various hospitals. Depending on the case, these emergency visits can be covered by your medical plan.ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nHow to decide on the HMO you need\nThe goal of these various medical coverage plans are to make your next medical situation as easy as possible. Health insurance provides the largest amount of benefits (albeit with comparatively high premiums), and PhilHealth provides the most standard service of medical discount on a basic premium (though limited in coverage). An HMO then stands as a comprehensive medical plan that can work towards what you need the most as an individual based on cost/premium, coverage, and healthcare providers. (If you are employed and HMO is one of the benefits, the company decides of the HMO.) The cost of HMOs is varied — these prices can be as low as P500 for a year’s coverage up to P15,000 in medical consumable benefits."", 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:9806b940-697d-46a2-8f9c-db3f030b69b6>']}, {'passage': 'Being on workcover is a nightmare! Dealing with your injury,the complex workcover system, your employer, the WorkCover agent, rehabilitation agents, doctors and even lawyers can be mind boggling and very stressful! Here we share few tips that can help you survive WorkCover! Dealing with your injury- especially a permanent injury- and its after-effects can be extremely stressful. Negotiating your way around a very complex WorkCover system, dealing with your employer, the WorkCover agent, rehabilitation agents, doctors, so called “independent medical examiners” and even lawyers can be mind boggling and extremely stressful! Below are a few tips and tricks that can help you survive the WorkCover nightmare!Focus on your health and recovery\nYour highest priority should always be your health and to maximise your physical and/or psychological recovery.WorkCover must pay for all reasonable treatment costs. We strongly believe that the most important issue is to ensure that you are getting the best quality medical treatment possible. Related blog articles\n- surviving workcover some more tips\n- workcover survival guide for injured workers\n- on being on workcover and what it’s like\nWhen you are seriously injured, you will have to make many important decisions about your future. To make the right decisions it will be critical to understand as much as you possibly can about the structure of WorkCover benefits, for example, how they interact with your other employment entitlements, and what all your entitlements really are. WorkCover is an extremely complex system! The Act of Parliament which governs WorkCover alone is several hundred pages long and quite complicated. Trying to understand just what WorkCover does and does not provide is really important. There are many resources available to help you with this task. The most detailed information, apart from the Act itself, is on the WorkSafe website which contains a very detailed publication called the ‘Online Claims Manual‘. This contains detailed instructions from WorkCover to its agents on how to handle claims. It also includes very detailed information about the calculation and payment of WorkCover benefits. Remember this information is written from WorkCover’s perspective only. Nonetheless this can be a useful resource for people who want detailed information.Try to deal as best you can with WorkCover\nDealing with WorkCover and -especially- your case manager can be extremely stressful.Following a few simple guidelines can make dealing with WorkCover, and your case manager (and rehab providers) a tad easier. - The most important thing is that you keep good, written records. For example, if you want to claim travel expenses you need to submit details of all your trips to and from doctors, incl train, bus, tram, taxi and parking receipts. If there is an argument about your weekly payments because WorkCover feel you are not looking for work, keeping a record of all your attempts to obtain work can put you in a far better position. - We advice all injured workers to only communicate/correspond in writing, either via email or via letter/fax. You do have the right to refuse telephone contact and you also have the right to request that all correspondence/communications go through your legal representative, one of your doctors or an advocate. You can even put a “restraining” order on your harassing, bullying and/or intimidating case manager (see our workcover tips collection for sample letters). - It’s also very important that you keep a copy of all your documents. For example, when you receive a certificate of incapacity, the original should be provided to your employer but ensure you make a copy for your own records. - Ask under the Freedom of Information Act or the Workers Compensation Act, for a copy of all your medical reports, including independent medical examination reports. - When submitting your medical certificates ensure that you complete the section on the back of the certificate about your work activities. If you don’t it will delay your payments and the form will be sent back to you. It may also be useful to try and ensure that your certificates expire on a Saturday or Sunday to make it easier for WorkCover or your employer to calculate your weekly entitlement. This enables weekly benefits to be paid in whole weeks. - Sometimes (well dare we say “often’) the decisions that a case manager makes can be extremely frustrating.

What specific assistance does hospice provide home-based patients? Hospice patients are cared for by a team consisting of a physician, nurse practitioner, a nurse, social workers, certified nursing assistants, clergy, therapists, and volunteers. Each one provides assistance based on his or her own area of expertise. In addition, hospices provide medications, supplies, equipment, and other services related to the terminal illness. Does hospice do anything to make death come sooner? Hospice neither hastens nor postpones dying. Just as doctors and midwives lend support and expertise during the time of child birth, hospice provides its presence and specialized knowledge during the dying process. Is hospice care covered by insurance? Hospice coverage is widely available. It is provided by Medicare nationwide, by Medicaid in 47 states, and by most private insurance providers. To be sure of coverage, families should, of course, check with their employer or health insurance provider. If the patient is eligible for Medicare, will there be any additional expense to be paid? The Medicare Hospice Benefit covers the full scope of medical and support services for a life-limiting illness. Hospice care also supports the family and loved ones of the person through a variety of services. This benefit covers almost all aspects of hospice care with little expense to the patient or family. Can a hospice patient who shows signs of recovery be returned to regular medical treatment? Certainly. If the patient’s condition improves and the disease seems to be in remission, patients can be discharged from hospice and return to aggressive therapy or go on about their daily life. If the discharged patient should later need to return to hospice care, Medicare and most private insurance will allow additional coverage for this purpose. What does the hospice admission process involve? One of the first things the hospice program will do is contact the patient’s physician to make sure he or she agrees that hospice care is appropriate for this patient at this time. (Most hospices have medical staff available to help patients who have no physician.) The patient will be asked to sign consent and insurance forms. These are similar to the forms patients sign when they enter a hospital. The form Medicare patients sign also tells how electing the Medicare hospice benefit affects other Medicare coverage. Is there any special equipment or changes I must make in my home before hospice care begins? Your hospice provider will assess your needs, recommend any equipment, and help make arrangements to obtain any necessary equipment. Often the need for equipment is minimal at first and increases as the disease progresses. In general, hospice will assist in any way it can to make home care as convenient, clean and safe as possible.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:9f005b0f-4523-4054-b1b8-744f12b9b2c3>']}, {'passage': 'What is hospice? - Hospice is a coordinated program of palliative and supportive care with the focus on comfort care rather than curative care for those individuals diagnosed with a terminal illness.

How long can I remain on hospice? - The hospice benefit will continue to cover palliative and comfort care for an individual with a terminal illness for an initial 90-day period, a subsequent 90-day period, and indefinite subsequent 60-day periods as determined by the hospice medical director, and as long as you continue to meet the requirements of the hospice benefit. Will I have to stop all of my medications? - Our hospice views each case individually. We will work with your physician and pharmacy to determine which medications we will cover under the Medicare Hospice Benefit, which ones will be covered under your Part D plan, and which medications are determined to be no longer medically necessary and if continued, would become the financial responsibility of the patient. How will hospice manage my pain? - Our hospice team works with the patient and family to determine the needs for pain management. Each situation is individualized, with the goal being to provide the most effective pain relief. Do I have to stay home all the time? - You do not have to be homebound to receive hospice services. We encourage our patients to enjoy life as much as possible. Does hospice provide sitters? - The hospice benefit does not include sitters. The hospice may provide volunteers to stay with you for short periods of time if appropriate. Our hospice can provide you with a variety of resources listing sitter agencies who may be of service to you. The sitters are not employees of the hospice agency and therefore are not the responsibility of the hospice agency. If I live in a nursing home, can I receive hospice care? - Yes, our hospice provides hospice care where ever you live. This includes home, independent living facilities, assisted living facilities and nursing homes. Is it necessary that I have a DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) Order to receive hospice? - It is not necessary to have a DNR; however, our hospice will work with the patient and family to obtain a LaPOST, a living will, power of attorney and/or DNR, as necessary. When is it time to get hospice? - It is time for hospice when all measures to cure the patient of the terminal illness have been exhausted and when the physician declares the patient has a prognosis of six months or less, if the disease runs its natural course.

Partly because STP is a mix of so many varied experiences that every week is different to the previous one, and partly because my own understanding of my specialism keeps evolving as I move through these experiences. When I first applied for this course, I thought I had a reasonable understanding of what cancer genomics was. But now I see how naive I was and that three years is not anywhere near enough time to fully comprehend this very diverse and quickly developing area of science. So summarising it all in a few paragraphs will be a challenge but… let’s give it a go! Critical Care Science in the Wider Context\nCritical Care Science (CCS) is one of the smaller STP specialisms but deals with one of the most complex patient populations. Critical care patients range from elective cardiac surgery patients to major trauma and acute/chronic medical conditions. Critical care refers to specialised care for patients with life-threatening conditions; typically compromising of one or more organs that are failing. This level of care may be delivered in A+E, Intensive Care, High Dependency or specialist wards, e.g. long term ventilation. While a lot of the STP specialisms focus on a particular organ system or on a particular grouping of investigative techniques, the skills of CCS cover a holistic approach to clinical care, incorporating all areas of medicine and technology. Genetic counsellors see individuals and families to discuss genetic conditions that are present, or are thought to be present, in their family. Information about an individual’s personal medical history and their family history is taken into account when determining the likelihood of a genetic condition running in a family.', 'doc_IDs': ['<urn:uuid:0be89ca1-7f33-4f68-bd90-3f219782383e>']}, {'passage': 'Learning to live with a chronic illness is an exhausting challenge for everyone involved. From diagnosis until either the illness resolves or the client’s life ends, that individual and family must make every decision and every move with the chronic illness in mind. ;\nThe social worker’s role is many times fairly limited. It is often a matter of following the client and seeing that their basic needs are being met. At times, it does take on the role of sleuth when the social worker is able to go in search of resources to help pay for special needs for everything from prostheses to new treatments. At the very least, it is to help the client and their family to hold on to hope. Interview an individual who has a chronic illness. With the individual’s permission, interview them about what it is like to live with a chronic illness, the most difficult parts of being chronically ill, how they manage their illness, what aspects—if any—frighten them, what kind of social support and family support they have, how willing they would be to try new treatment methods, and which social worker stands out most in their mind (good or bad) and why. In a 5-6-minute video reflect on the following (Asking for a transcript not video recording):\n· Describe the patient and their chronic illness. What makes it difficult? How is it managed? · How did it feel for you to talk candidly with an individual about their illness? · Who would you say was more uncomfortable talking about it—you or the person you were interviewing? · How informed was in the individual about their illness and the treatments and prognosis? · How supported did this individual feel from the community, and how did that support change from before they became ill? · What insights did you gain from this experience that you will take into the field as a social worker to help when you work with clients with chronic illnesses?

You\u2019ve maybe never even heard of it. But in the event of a big health emergency, such as cancer, heart attack or stroke, critical illness insurance could be the only thing protecting you from financial ruin. Many people assume they\u2019re fully protected with a standard health insurance plan, but the exorbitant costs of treating life-threatening illnesses are usually more than any plan will cover. Read on to learn more about critical illness insurance and whether it's something you and your family should consider. KEY TAKEAWAYS. Critical illness insurance provides additional coverage for medical emergencies like heart attack, stroke, or cancer.. Because these emergencies or illnesses often incur greater than average medical costs, these policies pay out cash to help cover those overruns where traditional health insurance may fall short.. These policies come at a relatively low cost. However, the instances that they will cover are generally limited to a few illnesses or emergencies. Covered critical illnessesYour Critical Illness benefit can be paid out for the following qualifying critical illnesses:. Heart attack. Life threatening cancer. Loss of hearing, speech or vision. Major organ transplant. Paralysis. Coma. Renal failure. Stroke. Carcinoma in situ. Coronary artery bypass graft"",

                ""text"": ""Is Critical Illness Cover Worth It? If you take out Life Insurance or Decreasing Life Insurance, you can choose to add Critical Illness Cover for an extra cost. Depending on your circumstances, that cost could be quite significant. So if your budget can stretch to it, what's the benefit of Critical Illness Cover? This article outlines some of the benefits and considerations you should take into account to help you make an informed decision. What does Critical Illness Cover offer? Critical Illness Cover is designed to protect you and your loved ones from the financial impact of a critical illness. It could pay out a cash sum if you\u2019re diagnosed with, or undergo a medical procedure for one of the specified critical illnesses we cover during the length of your policy and you survive for 14 days from diagnosis. It could help pay for things like household bills, childcare costs or simply help maintain a reasonable standard of living for you and your family if you have to take time off work to recover. Who needs Critical Illness Cover? A critical illness can affect anyone at any age and can turn lives upside down. In the event of being unable to work due to critical illness, having a back-up plan in place can alleviate some of the financial stress of the situation. Some people may use their savings to supplement their loss of income, others may rely on an employment benefit package, while others may find that Critical Illness Cover is one of their best options if they need a cash sum. How much does Critical Illness Cover cost? The amount you pay can vary widely from person to person, so to get an idea of how you could be paying, its best to get a quote. These are some of the factors that will determine your premium:\n- whether or not you smoke, or have previously smoked in the last 12 months\n- your age\n- how much cover you want and how long you need it to last\n- your health and lifestyle, including your weight and family medical history\n- your job - some occupations are seen as higher risk and therefore can have higher premiums associated\nWhat's the difference between Life Insurance and Critical Illness Cover? The essential difference between Life Insurance and Critical Illness Cover is that the former provides financial protection in the event of your death during the length of your policy, while the latter covers you for the diagnosis of a specified critical illness. You might take out a Life Insurance policy and choose to add Critical Illness Cover for an extra cost. With Legal & General, you can not buy Critical Illness Cover as a standalone policy. Here are some of the differences between Life Insurance and Critical Illness Cover:\n- Control of funds \u2013 Life Insurance usually pays out to your loved ones, giving them control of how to use the money when a valid claim is made. With Critical Illness Cover, you would receive the pay out and can decide how best to use it. - The payout \u2013 life insurance is designed to pay out a cash sum in the event of your death and can help minimise the financial impact on your loved ones that are left behind. Whereas Critical Illness Cover is designed to pay out following the diagnosis of a specified critical illness, helping to alleviate some of the stress at a difficult time while you recover. - Children's Critical Illness Cover \u2013 this is included automatically with our Critical Illness Cover and offers some financial protection if your children become critically ill, which is not offered as part of our standard Life Insurance policy. Terms and conditions apply. You just need to remember that these policies are not savings and investment plans and have no cash value unless a valid claim is made. Our Critical Illness Cover\nSo, there are differences between Life and Critical Illness Cover, but both can help to protect you and your loved ones when you need it most."",

                ""text"": ""Critical Illness Protection Will Always Come In Handy\nCritical Illness insurance is a type of insurance that can provide a lump sum cash benefit to the insured if they are determined to have one of the critical illnesses identified in their insurance policy. This type of insurance was introduced in the late 1990s to help individuals cover their expenses associated with various critical illnesses. Critical Illness insurance is applicable to any individual who is concerned about the risks of critical illness. The three primary illnesses covered under critical illness policies include heart attack, stroke and cancer. However, these policies may also cover conditions such as heart transplants, coronary bypass surgery, kidney failure, angioplasty and paralysis. Individuals may need this insurance for a variety of reasons, such as to pay for their medical treatments that are not covered by their health plan or to pay for their mortgage when they are recovering. Other reasons may include having cash to replace a spouse\u2019s income while they are caring for the insured, and to pay for travel for treatments not available in the local market. Critical illness policies work by significantly reducing the financial losses that are normally incurred without the insurance. As soon as an individual is diagnosed with a covered condition, the insurance company provides a single lump sum payment that is tax-free. Depending upon the specific policy, these cash payments can range anywhere from $10,000 to $1 million. In addition, some policies will provide multiple cash payments for separate critical illnesses. For example, if an individual is diagnosed with cancer and survives, they will receive a cash payment. In addition, they will receive another cash payment in a few years if they suffer from a heart attack. There are essentially two types of critical illness policies, Simplified Individual Protection and Fully Underwritten Individual Plans. The Simplified Issue Individual Protection plans are issued after just a few health questions, are generally affordable and are available in amounts up to $50,000. Fully Underwritten Individual Plans are issued after medical information has been provided to the insurance company, and they are available in higher amounts."",
