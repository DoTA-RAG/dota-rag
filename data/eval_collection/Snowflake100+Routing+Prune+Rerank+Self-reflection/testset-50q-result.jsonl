These pieces are considered the most involving works of art, with larger Unikat items requiring several hours of very careful work to complete.","answer":"The term \"Unikat\" (Signature) in Polish pottery refers to pieces that are uniquely hand-painted by skilled artisans using both sponges and brushes. Each Unikat piece is individually signed by the artist, which distinguishes it as the most intricate and valuable work of art within the collection. This level of craftsmanship and personal touch requires a significant amount of time and care, especially for larger items, which can take several hours to complete. Regular Polish pottery pieces, while still beautiful, are typically produced with a combination of machine-applied decals and hand-painting, resulting in less intricate designs compared to Unikat pieces. Therefore, what makes a Polish pottery piece a Unikat (Signature) item is its unique hand-painted characteristics, the artist's signature, and the resulting high level of artistic expression.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: This Polish pottery Bowl\nis made by Ceramika Artystyczna\nworkshop in Boleslawiec, Poland.

My love for Polish pottery began with my own collection, which grew until I replaced most of my tableware with it. After receiving many compliments and buying a lot of pieces as gifts for friends and family, I decided to spread my love for Polish pottery and Groshek Pottery was born. Groshek (or groszek) means \"polka dot\" in Polish, which reflects the many beautiful spotty designs that Polish pottery is renowned for. What is Polish pottery? Every piece of Polish pottery is handmade and hand-decorated using stamps and brushes. It comes in hundreds of shapes, with patterns ranging from classic dots and “peacock eyes” to more intricate “artistic” or “UNIKAT” patterns. My pottery comes from Zaklady Ceramiczne “Boleslawiec”, which is one of the biggest manufacturers in the region and whose tradition goes back to the 19th century. Caring for your pottery\nThe high quality of the clay combined with the manufacturing process make Polish pottery extremely durable. Fired at over 1200°C, it is classed as stoneware and safe to use in dishwashers, microwaves and fridges. This makes Polish pottery suitable for everyday use at home and in catering. All dishes with a grooved bottom are also safe to use in traditional gas or electric ovens up to 280°C, as well as on glass, ceramic and electric hobs.\n\nWhat is Polish Pottery? In simple terms, it is functional art. Broken down in more simple terms, it is a product made from a dense white clay, twice glazed and fired at extremely high temperatures. The region where this comes from used to be part of Germany but is now Boleslawiec, Poland. The clay is the secret here. It is beautifully “white” allowing for various colors to stand out. This makes for the perfect artist pallet and Boleslawiec is a region known for it’s artists. The clay is dense. It does make it heavier but the product is superior. As long as you follow a few simple rules, it will last longer than any of us will. It does not chip like cheaper, lighter stoneware that is more porous. The double glaze allows for a scratch resistant surface that is lead and cadmium free. POLISH POTTERY IT IS 100% SAFE TO USE. IT IS OVEN SAFE, MICROWAVE SAFE, DISHWASHER SAFE AND FREEZER SAFE.

There are different levels of artistry (again, I’ll expand on that in another article) which will affect the price. You’ll notice that 95% of my pictures are taken using Polish pottery. That’s because it is the primary serving and cooking tools in my kitchen. Where can you buy Polish Pottery? Pacific Polish Pottery is the best place.

Whereas ceramic is a general time period that additionally includes porcelain, porcelain is a ceramic product that is made a bit otherwise than other ceramic products. The class of ceramics consists of porcelain but additionally clay, bone and different types of pottery. What additional differentiates the two is their composition. Porcelain is seen as a more refined type of ceramics and it’s composed of white clay and petuntse, which is a type of feldspar, found only in China. The merchandise are heated to a higher degree than common ceramic dishes or pottery. By heating these to over 2600 degrees the clay takes on a glasslike quality. Most collectors can tell just by sight and feel which is which. The ceramics often has a bit more within the weight department than does the porcelain. Ceramic figurines are additionally identified for their grainy textures. One certain-fire strategy to inform which is which is by sounding. This is the process the place you tap on the thing and listen for the pitch of the sound. The porcelains have a higher pitch. The Chinese perfected the making of porcelain particularly what is referred to, as positive “China” century’s ago. It took Europe about one other 800 years to make their first firing of anything comparable to what was coming out of China.

There are collections of each which are very expensive. If you want to begin your personal collection read to get concepts on tips on how to tell the distinction yourself. 1. If when held as much as a light supply you can see the shadow of the thing placed behind the figurine then it is porcelain.

My love for Polish pottery began with my own collection, which grew until I replaced most of my tableware with it. After receiving many compliments and buying a lot of pieces as gifts for friends and family, I decided to spread my love for Polish pottery and Groshek Pottery was born. Groshek (or groszek) means \"polka dot\" in Polish, which reflects the many beautiful spotty designs that Polish pottery is renowned for. What is Polish pottery? Every piece of Polish pottery is handmade and hand-decorated using stamps and brushes. It comes in hundreds of shapes, with patterns ranging from classic dots and “peacock eyes” to more intricate “artistic” or “UNIKAT” patterns. My pottery comes from Zaklady Ceramiczne “Boleslawiec”, which is one of the biggest manufacturers in the region and whose tradition goes back to the 19th century. Caring for your pottery\nThe high quality of the clay combined with the manufacturing process make Polish pottery extremely durable. Fired at over 1200°C, it is classed as stoneware and safe to use in dishwashers, microwaves and fridges. This makes Polish pottery suitable for everyday use at home and in catering. All dishes with a grooved bottom are also safe to use in traditional gas or electric ovens up to 280°C, as well as on glass, ceramic and electric hobs.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:97f8451b-bf37-41bf-8ee0-54bb5d7594a9>"]},{"passage":"What is Polish Pottery? In simple terms, it is functional art. Broken down in more simple terms, it is a product made from a dense white clay, twice glazed and fired at extremely high temperatures. The region where this comes from used to be part of Germany but is now Boleslawiec, Poland. The clay is the secret here. It is beautifully “white” allowing for various colors to stand out. This makes for the perfect artist pallet and Boleslawiec is a region known for it’s artists. The clay is dense. It does make it heavier but the product is superior. As long as you follow a few simple rules, it will last longer than any of us will. It does not chip like cheaper, lighter stoneware that is more porous. The double glaze allows for a scratch resistant surface that is lead and cadmium free. POLISH POTTERY IT IS 100% SAFE TO USE. IT IS OVEN SAFE, MICROWAVE SAFE, DISHWASHER SAFE AND FREEZER SAFE. In fact I have even cooked an entire dinner in this stoneware using only my grill. I’ll go into depth later about the patterns of polish pottery but for now it’s only important that you know that every single piece is done by hand. The pieces are cast from molds but the painting is unique. There is no mass production in the creation of this product. Orders take 6-9 months to complete. There are different levels of artistry (again, I’ll expand on that in another article) which will affect the price. You’ll notice that 95% of my pictures are taken using Polish pottery. That’s because it is the primary serving and cooking tools in my kitchen. Where can you buy Polish Pottery? Pacific Polish Pottery is the best place. Family owned since 2000, they know everything there is to know. They offer free shipping on orders over $99.00 and they are always listing new pieces.

Whereas ceramic is a general time period that additionally includes porcelain, porcelain is a ceramic product that is made a bit otherwise than other ceramic products. The class of ceramics consists of porcelain but additionally clay, bone and different types of pottery. What additional differentiates the two is their composition. Porcelain is seen as a more refined type of ceramics and it’s composed of white clay and petuntse, which is a type of feldspar, found only in China. The merchandise are heated to a higher degree than common ceramic dishes or pottery. By heating these to over 2600 degrees the clay takes on a glasslike quality. Most collectors can tell just by sight and feel which is which. The ceramics often has a bit more within the weight department than does the porcelain. Ceramic figurines are additionally identified for their grainy textures. One certain-fire strategy to inform which is which is by sounding. This is the process the place you tap on the thing and listen for the pitch of the sound. The porcelains have a higher pitch. The Chinese perfected the making of porcelain particularly what is referred to, as positive “China” century’s ago. It took Europe about one other 800 years to make their first firing of anything comparable to what was coming out of China. Figurines and dishes from the early intervals of China’s porcelain history normally command a hefty price. As to which is healthier all of it depends largely on the buyer and the aim of the piece.

If when held as much as a light supply you can see the shadow of the thing placed behind the figurine then it is porcelain. Porcelain has a translucent quality that different forms of ceramics lack. 2. Is the figurine’s surface smooth or grainy. Whether it is grainy it is not porcelain. Porcelain feels more like a glass surface, an egg at worst. Whether or not its a porcelain figurine or a ceramic figurine, you will enjoy it if it is made with care and quality. Ultimately, like anything else, it comes all the way down to what makes you the most blissful to look at and cherish. 3. Is the figurine of a delicate nature?

I’ve been fascinated by viewing the United States through his eyes from photos taken decades ago and now have enjoyed the journey of finding the same locations to see for myself. I hope you come back and check out the progression of the Vintage America project every Friday! Work began on the Crazy Horse Memorial in 1948 and, once completed, it will be the largest sculpture in the world. In the foreground is a model of what the planned Memorial will eventually look like…so while I was amazed at the detail of the face of Crazy Horse, I was also shocked at really how much of the sculpture had yet to be completed. Since the time of my grandfather’s photograph, Crazy Horse has also gained popularity as a must-see tourist attraction, hence the extended observation deck and Visitor Center addition behind the model statue. As I was waiting for the optimal time to capture the same image my grandfather had, it was particularly satisfying to have conversations with people regarding my project and see their excitement about it. One older woman even asked to take a picture of me holding my grandfather’s photo! All throughout my trip I came across people who were genuinely excited about my mission, which further confirmed that the venture I’m undertaking is a worthwhile endeavor. I hope that all of you feel the same and that you’ll continue to follow and support the project! Don’t miss any future Vintage America posts, subscribe for email updates!\n\nThe easiest way to visit the Crazy Horse Memorial is to fly to Sioux City, South Dakota, and rent a car. There are plenty of moderately priced hotels in the town of Custer. It’s worth spending several days exploring the Black Hills, which have a haunting beauty (they are the oldest mountains in North America). www.crazyhorse.org www.southdakotahotels.org\nIt’s a blast: Explosions carve the features of Lakota warrior Crazy Horse\n\nWhat you DO get are the cameras, wireless router, carrying case, 24\/7 streamed video, 15 days of stored video, the Apple or Android apps, and 24\/7 tech support. Riverwind Surveillance Supply makes cameras that are oriented toward the horse owner. They have two different setups, but neither need internet at the barn. The cameras are all wired to a control unit, which needs to be plugged in to power. This unit can then transmit the data to a receiver and then you can view the video on your TV. This is a bit more complex than some of the newer systems that have popped up on the market, but seems to be better for more remote, rural areas. Another option for horse people is the Saddlebrook BarnCam. They offer both wireless and wired camera systems that can be transmitted to your TV as well as a webcam version. Again, there’s more set up involved in these cameras, but there are more options for those with internet access. Best Drone for Horse Riding\nDJI Mavic Pro\nThinking of filming your rides with a drone? Want to see aerial videos of you and your horse galloping across fields of grain or down a beach at sunset? Our top pick, the Mavic Pro, has a built-in 4K camera, flight autonomy (i.e. flies itself), is comparatively quiet, can auto-track many different subjects, understands some hand gestures, and can be manually piloted with your smartphone. Note: Drones can be scary to horses. Be sure to desensitize your horse to these devices slowly. - Amazing 4K video\n- Fantastic auto-tracking\n- Easy to fly from your smartphone\n- Drone fly times are really short (~20 minutes) between charges\n- Noise and movement may spook horses (true for all drones)\nThere are a couple of things to consider before taking the leap into drones. - Drones can be scary to horses. They make a lot of a very weird noise (think of a can of angry hornets), produce copious amounts of wind, and hover around like a tiny, malicious UFOs! - If you have a sensitive horse, they might never accept a drone’s presence. - Your super chill, bomb-proof horse will likely still need to be desensitized. - Never film around other horses (e.g. trails) that may not be comfortable with drones. You don’t want to spook anyone else’s horse! - You need to register your drone with the FAA and pay close attention to the rules in your area. - Do your homework and look up the local drone laws where you’re planning on flying. Have a GoPro? Want a drone? Try the GoPro Karma. It’s excellent for starters and has an easy to use gamepad-like controller for simple flying. You can buy the drone, or the full package that includes the GoPro camera and stabilizer stick. Note: It’s heavy and doesn’t have sensors to avoid crashing into things. When you think of a drone, you may think of a completely autonomous flying device. That’s pretty much what the HEXO+ is. It flies itself. It takes off alone, flies around, and films you riding all by itself, and then lands. Note: You have to buy a GoPro camera separately, and you need a compatible smart phone. The DJI Spark is a little mini-drone. It’s cheap, easy to fly, has sensors to avoid collisions, includes built-in camera with stabilization, understands certain hand gestures, and recognizes your face. It does use a controller, but also has different autopilot settings and can even follow a target. Note: It can be tricky flying with your smart phone. If you want a controller those are sold separately. If you’re doing more extreme riding and want a drone to follow you around, it might be time to get yourself the Airdog ADII. This drone was built with sports in mind. It’s durable, waterproof, and has epic tracking even in intense terrain. People that use it (successfully) are usually thrilled with the results. You will need to buy a camera, but luckily it’s set up to work the best with a GoPro. Note: People have complained about defective batteries and sub-par customer service. Best Horse Photography Camera\nCanon 7D Mark II\nIt also has weather sealing, which can be a must for the potential environmental hazards you’ll find at both indoor and outdoor horse shows and around the barn.\n\nPost new question\nDoes anyone use a drone here whenever you travel inside india? is it really necessary to take permission before flying a drone in rural or tourist places inside india? There are guidelines to use the Drone more than like 2Km , 5Km range as we used small drones for capturing pictures from around 200m ..400m so you can use with the normal permissions. Yes Local police or forest dept for some trek . Normal permission means the local police or the local tourism incharge? The one with higher frequency radius sure needs permission which is quite impossible to get. Drones are specifically not allowed in touristy places, try shooting gorilla and don’t get caught if you really need some drone shots.

Any leads?\n\nJust make sure that if you use a flat class photo, that your horse is singled out and preforming its best. I guarantee that will draw potential buyers to your horse. If the purpose of your photo is to get some feedback on your horse's conformation on JMR, then I suggest taking that picture like you are a judge on JMR. The most common comment I see from Carol Dean Porter is \"Please remove leg wraps and stand him up facing forward, with head held in normal position and legs separated by about 6 inches. Take the picture directly from the side and about even with his shoulder.\" Yet no matter how many times she comments with this answer, people still submit photos with legs cut off, horses in full tack, and horses standing in a field about 100 yards away from the camera. She doesn't say this for her health. Her advice is free, don't take advantage of her time too. Good example of singling out a rider\nGood example of a conformation photo\nC. Is this the only angle\/the only lighting\/the only framing\/ the only distance that I can get on this photo? Some photos are once in a life time opportunities. However, for the most part a horse show presents many opportunities to get similar shots. Jump-offs often include fences from the original course. One class may use the same jump for another. Therefore I always suggest playing with angles\/lighting\/lens length ect. in order to achieve the perfect photo. Using a tilt-shift lens\nUsing colors for composition\nThe best advice for advancing your photography is to take pictures as often as you can. Learn from your mistakes and study up on professionals. Would love to see your photos if you have them.\n\nQuadcopters are great devices that allow us to have some good, clean fun without having to stick our faces against computer screens or handheld devices. Quadcopters offer endless hours of enjoyment, merging both technology and the great outdoors with just one, small gadget. The Scouts have joined in on the quadcopter bandwagon and have been using these devices to add some extra excitement to their already awesome activities. There are countless fun-filled things you can do with a quadcopter drone, and here are a few of them. - Advanced Exploration – Scouts are encouraged to explore – that’s one of their best abilities. With the vast space and outdoor areas they’re given to frolic around in, it can get pretty easy pretty fast. Adding a drone or quadcopter into the picture makes the task just that much more exciting. Think about all the great fun you’ll have hiding out your copter in an area and having your friends locate it with nothing more than pure Scout’s ability. - Superb Documentation – Some quadcopters have built-in cameras, and that’s a great way to document some of the awesome events and fun-filled activities that take place at Scouts events. There are endless possibilities when it comes to recording and capturing videos and pictures of these events with a quadcopter. Plus the fact that you can savour the memories when you look back makes this idea a no-brainer. - Advanced Target Practice – Scouts are often put through training programs for archery and rifle shooting to sharpen their skills when it comes to hitting a target. If you’re tired of those targets that just sit there and stare back at you, why not take it to the next level with a quadcopter? Some Scouts have tried attaching reasonably sized paper targets and markers that dangle from quadcopters for some advanced target shooting practice. While it does sound like a great idea, there are risks and dangers that come with this activity. Make sure you dangle your targets a considerable distance from your quadcopter to avoid any damage to your device. There you have it. There are loads of fun activities you can have with your quadcopter as long as you keep an imaginative mind. Now, make like a Scout and join in on the quadcopter bandwagon! Take to the skies and have a fun-filled adventure with your flying device.\n\n1. Eiffel Tower\nLocation: Paris, France\nEveryone can take photos of the famous Parisian landmark during the day, but photographing the Eiffel Tower when the nighttime illumination is on is actually illegal. Photographers craving to take a picture of the tower at night and share their photo online will need written permission. 2. Neuschwanstein Castle\nLocation: Schwangau, Bavaria, Germany\nThis Bavarian gem was the inspiration for Walt Disney's logo, and I'm sure you can catch the resemblance. But what most people don't know is that visiting the castle is allowed only in guided tours limited to 35 minutes, and photography is strictly banned indoors. 3. Valley of the Kings\nLocation: Luxor, Egypt\nThe Valley of the Kings is the burial place of Egyptian kings who lived in the 16-11th century B.C. and it's a fascinating sight to behold, but the valuable relics and artifacts held in this place and extremely fragile, and so photography is strictly forbidden. Anyone who brings a camera to the tombs and monuments risks getting a US$115 fine. 4. The Alamo\nLocation: San Antonio, Texas, USA\nThe historical site of the Battle of the Alamo turned into the symbol of heroic resistance and is a must-see sight in Texas. Guided tours are available at the historical site, but taking photos on the premises is strictly forbidden. 5. Michelangelo’s Statue of David\nLocation: Galleria dell'Accademia, Florence, Italy\nThe Statue of David is probably the most famous sculpture in the world, and we all have certainly seen a lot of pictures of the statue. Somewhat confusingly, photographing the famous sculpture is prohibited, and you will be escorted out if you so much as attempt to capture a shot. 6. Westminster Abbey\nLocation: London, UK\nThe burial place of English monarchs and famous Brits is an iconic sight, and no one bans you from photographing its luxurious and impressive facade, but when it comes to the interior of the world-famous church, you'll be kindly asked to abstain from photography. To make up for the missed shots, the management of the church offers everyone to freely download professionally-taken photos of the cathedral from their website. 7. Kumsusan Palace of the Sun\nLocation: Pyongyang, North Korea\nThis building is the burial place of North Korean founder Kim Il-sung and his son Kim Jong-il, and it goes without saying that getting into the mausoleum if you're a foreign visitor isn't easy. Tourists from abroad can ask for permission to visit the place as a part of the official government tour, and if you get in, you have to check-in everything apart from your wallet at the entrance. Then, you have to pass through a dust-blowing machine before you finally enter the room with the sarcophagi. Do we even have to mention that photography isn’t allowed? 8. Uluru and Kata-Tjuta National Park\nLocation: Northern Australia\nAyers Rock is one of the most famous Australian landmarks, and one that has great cultural importance to the local Aboriginal population, the Anangu. They believe that some of their sacred sites, ceremonies and objects should not be recorded, and Ayers Rock is one of such sights. In practice, it's certainly quite difficult to ban people from taking pictures in the vast territory of the national park, so unless you plan to share the photo on social media or use it for commercial purposes, you will likely be able to take a quick selfie. Photographers entering with professional equipment, however, will be denied entrance. 9. Sistine Chapel\nLocation: The Apostolic Palace, Vatican City\nA former church, the Sistine Chapel is now a museum that showcases the work of some of the greatest artists of the Renaissance, such as Michelangelo, Sandro Botticelli, and Cosimo Rosselli, who created exquisite frescos on the walls and the ceiling of the chapel. Preserving these masterpieces in a good state is crucial, and so photography is strictly forbidden, as will surely be pointed out to you at the entrance. 10. Taj Mahal\nLocation: Agra, India\nAs it is the case with many of these tourist destinations, photography from the outside of the Taj Mahal building is allowed, but the interior of the sight is kept photography-free. Smoking, eating and making loud noises are prohibited as well. Recently, the management of the site imposed a time restriction on one's visit: you shouldn't stay for more than 3 hours at a time.\n\nThe price for a 64 GB memory card starts at $10. - Storage for photographs. Whether it’s an external hard drive, USB flash drive, or cloud storage, it doesn’t matter, but please make sure you have enough place to upload the packs of photos you shoot daily. A few terabytes must be enough even if you take thousands of pictures a day. - Filters for lenses. If you go with an expensive lens, it’s worthwhile to spend a few dozen dollars on filters so that the lens won’t get damaged or scratched during the photo shooting in the field. Also, consider purchasing a polarizing filter to manage reflections, darken skies, suppress glare from the water surface, and basically, change the balance of light to benefit your photos. - Batteries and power banks. Running out of power in the middle of a photoshoot is the worst experience ever, so make sure to buy an additional battery and maybe a power bank, especially if you’re going to take more than a few hundred shots a day. - Tripod. Whether small or large, a tripod significantly expands your creative horizons. It might be Vanguard VEO 2 204AB for lightweight setups, an ultra-compact Sirui NT-1005X\/E-10, or a giant Manfrotto 290 Dual MK290DUA3-BH – just imagine the locations you are going to conquer and try to figure out which tripod could be a win-win option to take versatile shots without sacrificing the comfort. - Insurance. Last but not least, consider getting an insurance cover for your camera if the latter costs a few thousand dollars. There are lots of companies offering insurance for photographers, including but not limited to Hill & Usher, Imaging Insurance, Professional Photographers of American Photo Care Insurance, Front Row Insurance, E & I Insurance, etc. #3 Preparation at Your Destination\nTo capture the moments in a way that you would love to relive them across the years, you should master how to use your camera in the manual mode by finding the best relationship between ISO (sensitivity of your camera to light), aperture (how much light goes through the lens), and shutter speed (how fast the shutter opens and closes). While that knowledge will definitely come to you with practice, arranging things at the place of destination within a limited time frame might be more challenging. - Research the locations. In addition to the research you’ve made at home using Instagram, Google, Pinterest, and social networks (you’ve made it, right? ), it would be very helpful to scout the location the day before photo shooting. The better you do your ‘homework,’ the more net time you will have to take pictures instead of choosing positions, angles, and making other adjustments that should have already been done. - Get ready to wake up early. The hour after the dawn and the hour before the sunset are known as the best time to take pictures, and this is especially true for natural settings since city lights do not intervene. Warm morning light will breathe liveliness, romantics, and unusual charm into your shots, making them especially warm and dear. - Soak up the local culture. The information that you find on the web can acquaint you with all the features of the setting and maybe even convey the atmosphere, but still, you will have to earn the trust of the locals if you want to photo-shoot them. Don’t rush to take pictures – take your time to feel the spirit of the place you are in. Be polite with locals, smile, give gifts, buy souvenirs, and only after that start taking pictures if you are granted permission. - Do not book organized tours. It’s always a temptation to relax and book an organized tour where you can just follow the recommendation of your guide and serenely contemplate the beauty around you. Unfortunately, you are unlikely to take great pictures during organized tours for these are usually too crowded, as well as the time is limited. Organized tours might work only for small groups with good photography ethics. Photography Composition Tips\n#4 Use leading lines to start your story\nTo get a great opening line in your photo story, you may take advantage of landscape forms, architecture, or anything else resembling leading lines – the natural lines that lead the viewer to the main object in the picture.\n\nWhat is the legal situation regarding the taking of photos in Ireland - is it a free-for-all, or are there strict rules to be adhered to? If you are heading for a vacation, you pack your camera, easy-peasy. But what are you actually allowed to photograph, and how can you use it afterward? While casual photography in Ireland is seen very, well, casual, there are some rules to keep in mind. I have tried to sum up a few here. Please take note that these are my personal interpretations of the law, from daily practice as a “snapper” - if you are looking for legal advice you should contact a solicitor. And these rules mainly apply to hobbyists and tourists, professional (commercial) photography is a totally different kettle of fish ... if you want to make money out of your holiday snapshots, and these are of people, you might want to ask for legal advice before landing yourself in hot water. Photography in Public Places\nGenerally speaking, you may take photographs to your heart's content as long as you are in a public place. The definition of \"public place\" here being a place not in private ownership, which you may enter freely and without conditions imposed. A museum e.g. may be in public ownership, but upon entering it you implicitly agree to obey by any \"house rules\" - in effect making it \"private property\" (see below). Note that all this refers to you yourself being in a public place, not to the object of your photographic desire being there. Snapping a private place from public space is actually legal. As long as you are in a public place, you may take images of private property such as buildings or artworks ... but the owner may object and even threaten to call the guards. Avoid a confrontation, say \"Sorry! \", smile and calmly walk away. Trespassing and Obstructing\nOne thing you may not do while taking photos in public places is trespassing (obvious) and cause an obstruction. The latter is interesting as it includes not only walking out in front of traffic, but may also affect the use of tripods. \"Causing an obstruction\" also refers to the effect your snapping may have on the work of a police officer. As this is very much open to interpretation it is advisable to cease and desist if you are asked by police. Photography on Private Property\nYou may take photos on private property - provided the owner or occupier agrees with you being there (otherwise you are trespassing), and tolerates your activity. By entering the private property you implicitly agree to obey by any rules set by the owner or occupier and made known to you. \"Made known\" includes house rules posted in shopping malls or similar. If the owner, the occupier or their representatives (mostly security staff) ask you to stop taking photos, do so - disobey and you may be guilty of trespassing. They do, however, have no right to confiscate (or damage) any of your equipment. Two special mentions - the Airport Police at Dublin Airport seem to be very negative towards anybody not obviously just taking a snapshot of a loved one. On the other hand, the National Museum of Ireland has relaxed the rules and abandoned the strict \"no photography\" dictum in favor of \"no flash, no tripod\". Yes, you may, in an open and non-invasive way - unless people object or objections are made on their behalf. Then again privacy laws are very iffy and it might be better to refrain. If you restrict your photography to groups, officials, and those participating in some sort of public performance or ceremony you should be okay. On the other hand, snapping away with an unobtrusive telephoto lens while walking through Dublin is no problem. Note that if you want to sell images of people, you should get a model release form signed. Photography of Children\nOne thing worth mentioning is the über-careful rules and regulations laid down mainly in Northern Irish museums regarding photography. In effect, you will be asked not to take any pictures of children, a backlash of the prevalent pedophilia hysteria. Many places also ask you to fill in a form and sign it, agreeing to these conditions (though I have never been asked for ID when doing this, leading me to the thought that one could easily use fake names here). I would also caution against strolling into a park or playground and then starting to take images of children. “Concerned citizens” will, more than likely, soon be onto your case.\n\nYou’re on a trip, and there it is before your eyes: the most beautiful, unique, interesting or amazing thing you’ve ever seen. You just want to capture the image so you can show your friends and family back home or relive the moment over again. But click after click, you just can’t get the picture to do the scene real justice. Taking beautiful travel photographs can be difficult, but by following these tips, you can improve your odds of getting the perfect shot. Invest in a quality camera\nWhether you prefer film or digital, point and shoot or SLR (single lens reflex), you don’t have to spend a fortune to get a quality camera that won’t let you down. Talk to the staff at your local camera or electronics store to find the best camera for you – one that fits your needs and your budget. Be sure to buy any accessories you’ll need such as zoom lenses, carrying cases, adapters for chargers, or extra batteries. Practice makes perfect\nStudy your camera’s instruction manual. Many cameras come with instructional DVDs as well, and some camera retailers even offer free classes to customers. Play around with the settings on your camera to see how they affect each shot. The more you know about the different settings, the more options you have for controls like shutter speed (controls how fast the picture is taken), white balance (controls brightness) and aperture (controls how much light the lens lets in). Shoot from a variety of angles\nYou never know which angle will provide the perfect shot, so capture your subject from a variety of angles and vantage points, from far away to up close, outside or in, in the background or front and center, and all alone or in the context of its setting. This will also keep the whole collection fresh and interesting. Take pictures of both people and things\nYou in front of the Eiffel Tower. You in front of the Acropolis. You in front of the Berlin Wall. Seeing a pattern here? Of course, it’s nice to have lots of photos of yourself in front of places you’ve visited, but be sure to also take photos of just the location or monument from your viewpoint as well. It’ll break up the monotony while still serving as a potent reminder of your travels. Capture action and details\nCapture the action of a location, not just its still-life. Rather than only snapping shots of a market, get some photos of the sellers in action too. And in addition to a few shots of the people bustling around the stalls, get close up on some of the details. Varying these conditions can help bring a setting to life and make your photos more exciting. Learn to photograph people\nA certain amount of finesse is required for getting great photos of strangers. You want to capture the perfect shot, but don’t want to be intrusive. Unless you are shooting from far away, always ask the subject’s permission (for kids, ask the parents). Many people will jump at the chance to be photographed while others will become quite shy once the camera is pointed at them. Put your subject at ease before you start shooting, or engage them in conversation while another person takes the photos. Play with scale\nDepending on where you place one item in relation to other, you can create different effects with scale. Those silly photos where it looks like someone is about to push over the Leaning Tower of Pisa, for example, are just tricks of scale. In addition to creating effects, scale can convey a sense of the size of a place. To show just how large a rock is, have a person standing nearby. This helps the viewer better see its size. Take candid shots\nSome of a trip’s most memorable moments happen spontaneously. Be sure to take some candid shots in addition to all the posed portraits. A shot of your group laughing uproariously at a joke may invoke a much stronger memory of a particular place than any posed scenery shot ever could. Know when to put the camera down\nSometimes you just aren’t going to be able to get the perfect shot, no matter how hard you try. Don’t let your obsession with photographing the moment get in the way of actually experiencing it. Learn the tricks of photo editing\nOften a shot that doesn’t quite work can be made drastically better through photo editing. With online programs, you can easily adjust the sharpness of a blurry photo, brighten up a dark one, increase the color saturation of a dull shot and crop photos or add special effects.","passages":[{"passage":"The collection of my grandfather’s photographs that I’ve had the chance to replicate continues this week with a shot of the Crazy Horse Memorial in South Dakota. I’ve been fascinated by viewing the United States through his eyes from photos taken decades ago and now have enjoyed the journey of finding the same locations to see for myself. I hope you come back and check out the progression of the Vintage America project every Friday! Work began on the Crazy Horse Memorial in 1948 and, once completed, it will be the largest sculpture in the world. In the foreground is a model of what the planned Memorial will eventually look like…so while I was amazed at the detail of the face of Crazy Horse, I was also shocked at really how much of the sculpture had yet to be completed. Since the time of my grandfather’s photograph, Crazy Horse has also gained popularity as a must-see tourist attraction, hence the extended observation deck and Visitor Center addition behind the model statue. As I was waiting for the optimal time to capture the same image my grandfather had, it was particularly satisfying to have conversations with people regarding my project and see their excitement about it. One older woman even asked to take a picture of me holding my grandfather’s photo! All throughout my trip I came across people who were genuinely excited about my mission, which further confirmed that the venture I’m undertaking is a worthwhile endeavor. I hope that all of you feel the same and that you’ll continue to follow and support the project!

Riverwind Surveillance Supply makes cameras that are oriented toward the horse owner. They have two different setups, but neither need internet at the barn. The cameras are all wired to a control unit, which needs to be plugged in to power. This unit can then transmit the data to a receiver and then you can view the video on your TV. This is a bit more complex than some of the newer systems that have popped up on the market, but seems to be better for more remote, rural areas. Another option for horse people is the Saddlebrook BarnCam. They offer both wireless and wired camera systems that can be transmitted to your TV as well as a webcam version. Again, there’s more set up involved in these cameras, but there are more options for those with internet access. Best Drone for Horse Riding\nDJI Mavic Pro\nThinking of filming your rides with a drone? Want to see aerial videos of you and your horse galloping across fields of grain or down a beach at sunset? Our top pick, the Mavic Pro, has a built-in 4K camera, flight autonomy (i.e. flies itself), is comparatively quiet, can auto-track many different subjects, understands some hand gestures, and can be manually piloted with your smartphone. Note: Drones can be scary to horses. Be sure to desensitize your horse to these devices slowly. - Amazing 4K video\n- Fantastic auto-tracking\n- Easy to fly from your smartphone\n- Drone fly times are really short (~20 minutes) between charges\n- Noise and movement may spook horses (true for all drones)\nThere are a couple of things to consider before taking the leap into drones. - Drones can be scary to horses. They make a lot of a very weird noise (think of a can of angry hornets), produce copious amounts of wind, and hover around like a tiny, malicious UFOs! - If you have a sensitive horse, they might never accept a drone’s presence. - Your super chill, bomb-proof horse will likely still need to be desensitized. - Never film around other horses (e.g. trails) that may not be comfortable with drones. You don’t want to spook anyone else’s horse! - You need to register your drone with the FAA and pay close attention to the rules in your area. - Do your homework and look up the local drone laws where you’re planning on flying. Have a GoPro? Want a drone? Try the GoPro Karma. It’s excellent for starters and has an easy to use gamepad-like controller for simple flying. You can buy the drone, or the full package that includes the GoPro camera and stabilizer stick. Note: It’s heavy and doesn’t have sensors to avoid crashing into things. When you think of a drone, you may think of a completely autonomous flying device. That’s pretty much what the HEXO+ is. It flies itself. It takes off alone, flies around, and films you riding all by itself, and then lands. Note: You have to buy a GoPro camera separately, and you need a compatible smart phone. The DJI Spark is a little mini-drone. It’s cheap, easy to fly, has sensors to avoid collisions, includes built-in camera with stabilization, understands certain hand gestures, and recognizes your face. It does use a controller, but also has different autopilot settings and can even follow a target. Note: It can be tricky flying with your smart phone. If you want a controller those are sold separately. If you’re doing more extreme riding and want a drone to follow you around, it might be time to get yourself the Airdog ADII. This drone was built with sports in mind. It’s durable, waterproof, and has epic tracking even in intense terrain. People that use it (successfully) are usually thrilled with the results. You will need to buy a camera, but luckily it’s set up to work the best with a GoPro. Note: People have complained about defective batteries and sub-par customer service.

The most common comment I see from Carol Dean Porter is \"Please remove leg wraps and stand him up facing forward, with head held in normal position and legs separated by about 6 inches. Take the picture directly from the side and about even with his shoulder.\" Yet no matter how many times she comments with this answer, people still submit photos with legs cut off, horses in full tack, and horses standing in a field about 100 yards away from the camera.

Quadcopters offer endless hours of enjoyment, merging both technology and the great outdoors with just one, small gadget. The Scouts have joined in on the quadcopter bandwagon and have been using these devices to add some extra excitement to their already awesome activities. There are countless fun-filled things you can do with a quadcopter drone, and here are a few of them. - Advanced Exploration – Scouts are encouraged to explore – that’s one of their best abilities. With the vast space and outdoor areas they’re given to frolic around in, it can get pretty easy pretty fast. Adding a drone or quadcopter into the picture makes the task just that much more exciting. Think about all the great fun you’ll have hiding out your copter in an area and having your friends locate it with nothing more than pure Scout’s ability. - Superb Documentation – Some quadcopters have built-in cameras, and that’s a great way to document some of the awesome events and fun-filled activities that take place at Scouts events. There are endless possibilities when it comes to recording and capturing videos and pictures of these events with a quadcopter. Plus the fact that you can savour the memories when you look back makes this idea a no-brainer. - Advanced Target Practice – Scouts are often put through training programs for archery and rifle shooting to sharpen their skills when it comes to hitting a target. If you’re tired of those targets that just sit there and stare back at you, why not take it to the next level with a quadcopter? Some Scouts have tried attaching reasonably sized paper targets and markers that dangle from quadcopters for some advanced target shooting practice. While it does sound like a great idea, there are risks and dangers that come with this activity. Make sure you dangle your targets a considerable distance from your quadcopter to avoid any damage to your device. There you have it. There are loads of fun activities you can have with your quadcopter as long as you keep an imaginative mind. Now, make like a Scout and join in on the quadcopter bandwagon!

Eiffel Tower\nLocation: Paris, France\nEveryone can take photos of the famous Parisian landmark during the day, but photographing the Eiffel Tower when the nighttime illumination is on is actually illegal. Photographers craving to take a picture of the tower at night and share their photo online will need written permission. 2. Neuschwanstein Castle\nLocation: Schwangau, Bavaria, Germany\nThis Bavarian gem was the inspiration for Walt Disney's logo, and I'm sure you can catch the resemblance. But what most people don't know is that visiting the castle is allowed only in guided tours limited to 35 minutes, and photography is strictly banned indoors. 3. Valley of the Kings\nLocation: Luxor, Egypt\nThe Valley of the Kings is the burial place of Egyptian kings who lived in the 16-11th century B.C. and it's a fascinating sight to behold, but the valuable relics and artifacts held in this place and extremely fragile, and so photography is strictly forbidden. Anyone who brings a camera to the tombs and monuments risks getting a US$115 fine. 4. The Alamo\nLocation: San Antonio, Texas, USA\nThe historical site of the Battle of the Alamo turned into the symbol of heroic resistance and is a must-see sight in Texas. Guided tours are available at the historical site, but taking photos on the premises is strictly forbidden. 5. Michelangelo’s Statue of David\nLocation: Galleria dell'Accademia, Florence, Italy\nThe Statue of David is probably the most famous sculpture in the world, and we all have certainly seen a lot of pictures of the statue. Somewhat confusingly, photographing the famous sculpture is prohibited, and you will be escorted out if you so much as attempt to capture a shot. 6. Westminster Abbey\nLocation: London, UK\nThe burial place of English monarchs and famous Brits is an iconic sight, and no one bans you from photographing its luxurious and impressive facade, but when it comes to the interior of the world-famous church, you'll be kindly asked to abstain from photography. To make up for the missed shots, the management of the church offers everyone to freely download professionally-taken photos of the cathedral from their website. 7. Kumsusan Palace of the Sun\nLocation: Pyongyang, North Korea\nThis building is the burial place of North Korean founder Kim Il-sung and his son Kim Jong-il, and it goes without saying that getting into the mausoleum if you're a foreign visitor isn't easy. Tourists from abroad can ask for permission to visit the place as a part of the official government tour, and if you get in, you have to check-in everything apart from your wallet at the entrance. Then, you have to pass through a dust-blowing machine before you finally enter the room with the sarcophagi. Do we even have to mention that photography isn’t allowed? 8. Uluru and Kata-Tjuta National Park\nLocation: Northern Australia\nAyers Rock is one of the most famous Australian landmarks, and one that has great cultural importance to the local Aboriginal population, the Anangu. They believe that some of their sacred sites, ceremonies and objects should not be recorded, and Ayers Rock is one of such sights. In practice, it's certainly quite difficult to ban people from taking pictures in the vast territory of the national park, so unless you plan to share the photo on social media or use it for commercial purposes, you will likely be able to take a quick selfie. Photographers entering with professional equipment, however, will be denied entrance. 9. Sistine Chapel\nLocation: The Apostolic Palace, Vatican City\nA former church, the Sistine Chapel is now a museum that showcases the work of some of the greatest artists of the Renaissance, such as Michelangelo, Sandro Botticelli, and Cosimo Rosselli, who created exquisite frescos on the walls and the ceiling of the chapel. Preserving these masterpieces in a good state is crucial, and so photography is strictly forbidden, as will surely be pointed out to you at the entrance. 10. Taj Mahal\nLocation: Agra, India\nAs it is the case with many of these tourist destinations, photography from the outside of the Taj Mahal building is allowed, but the interior of the sight is kept photography-free. Smoking, eating and making loud noises are prohibited as well.

Whether it’s an external hard drive, USB flash drive, or cloud storage, it doesn’t matter, but please make sure you have enough place to upload the packs of photos you shoot daily. A few terabytes must be enough even if you take thousands of pictures a day. - Filters for lenses. If you go with an expensive lens, it’s worthwhile to spend a few dozen dollars on filters so that the lens won’t get damaged or scratched during the photo shooting in the field. Also, consider purchasing a polarizing filter to manage reflections, darken skies, suppress glare from the water surface, and basically, change the balance of light to benefit your photos. - Batteries and power banks. Running out of power in the middle of a photoshoot is the worst experience ever, so make sure to buy an additional battery and maybe a power bank, especially if you’re going to take more than a few hundred shots a day. - Tripod. Whether small or large, a tripod significantly expands your creative horizons. It might be Vanguard VEO 2 204AB for lightweight setups, an ultra-compact Sirui NT-1005X\/E-10, or a giant Manfrotto 290 Dual MK290DUA3-BH – just imagine the locations you are going to conquer and try to figure out which tripod could be a win-win option to take versatile shots without sacrificing the comfort. - Insurance. Last but not least, consider getting an insurance cover for your camera if the latter costs a few thousand dollars. There are lots of companies offering insurance for photographers, including but not limited to Hill & Usher, Imaging Insurance, Professional Photographers of American Photo Care Insurance, Front Row Insurance, E & I Insurance, etc. #3 Preparation at Your Destination\nTo capture the moments in a way that you would love to relive them across the years, you should master how to use your camera in the manual mode by finding the best relationship between ISO (sensitivity of your camera to light), aperture (how much light goes through the lens), and shutter speed (how fast the shutter opens and closes). While that knowledge will definitely come to you with practice, arranging things at the place of destination within a limited time frame might be more challenging. - Research the locations. In addition to the research you’ve made at home using Instagram, Google, Pinterest, and social networks (you’ve made it, right? ), it would be very helpful to scout the location the day before photo shooting. The better you do your ‘homework,’ the more net time you will have to take pictures instead of choosing positions, angles, and making other adjustments that should have already been done. - Get ready to wake up early. The hour after the dawn and the hour before the sunset are known as the best time to take pictures, and this is especially true for natural settings since city lights do not intervene. Warm morning light will breathe liveliness, romantics, and unusual charm into your shots, making them especially warm and dear. - Soak up the local culture. The information that you find on the web can acquaint you with all the features of the setting and maybe even convey the atmosphere, but still, you will have to earn the trust of the locals if you want to photo-shoot them. Don’t rush to take pictures – take your time to feel the spirit of the place you are in. Be polite with locals, smile, give gifts, buy souvenirs, and only after that start taking pictures if you are granted permission. - Do not book organized tours. It’s always a temptation to relax and book an organized tour where you can just follow the recommendation of your guide and serenely contemplate the beauty around you. Unfortunately, you are unlikely to take great pictures during organized tours for these are usually too crowded, as well as the time is limited. Organized tours might work only for small groups with good photography ethics.

If you are heading for a vacation, you pack your camera, easy-peasy. But what are you actually allowed to photograph, and how can you use it afterward? While casual photography in Ireland is seen very, well, casual, there are some rules to keep in mind. I have tried to sum up a few here. Please take note that these are my personal interpretations of the law, from daily practice as a “snapper” - if you are looking for legal advice you should contact a solicitor. And these rules mainly apply to hobbyists and tourists, professional (commercial) photography is a totally different kettle of fish ... if you want to make money out of your holiday snapshots, and these are of people, you might want to ask for legal advice before landing yourself in hot water. Photography in Public Places\nGenerally speaking, you may take photographs to your heart's content as long as you are in a public place. The definition of \"public place\" here being a place not in private ownership, which you may enter freely and without conditions imposed. A museum e.g. may be in public ownership, but upon entering it you implicitly agree to obey by any \"house rules\" - in effect making it \"private property\" (see below). Note that all this refers to you yourself being in a public place, not to the object of your photographic desire being there. Snapping a private place from public space is actually legal. As long as you are in a public place, you may take images of private property such as buildings or artworks ... but the owner may object and even threaten to call the guards. Avoid a confrontation, say \"Sorry! \", smile and calmly walk away. Trespassing and Obstructing\nOne thing you may not do while taking photos in public places is trespassing (obvious) and cause an obstruction. The latter is interesting as it includes not only walking out in front of traffic, but may also affect the use of tripods. \"Causing an obstruction\" also refers to the effect your snapping may have on the work of a police officer. As this is very much open to interpretation it is advisable to cease and desist if you are asked by police. Photography on Private Property\nYou may take photos on private property - provided the owner or occupier agrees with you being there (otherwise you are trespassing), and tolerates your activity. By entering the private property you implicitly agree to obey by any rules set by the owner or occupier and made known to you. \"Made known\" includes house rules posted in shopping malls or similar. If the owner, the occupier or their representatives (mostly security staff) ask you to stop taking photos, do so - disobey and you may be guilty of trespassing. They do, however, have no right to confiscate (or damage) any of your equipment. Two special mentions - the Airport Police at Dublin Airport seem to be very negative towards anybody not obviously just taking a snapshot of a loved one. On the other hand, the National Museum of Ireland has relaxed the rules and abandoned the strict \"no photography\" dictum in favor of \"no flash, no tripod\". Yes, you may, in an open and non-invasive way - unless people object or objections are made on their behalf. Then again privacy laws are very iffy and it might be better to refrain. If you restrict your photography to groups, officials, and those participating in some sort of public performance or ceremony you should be okay. On the other hand, snapping away with an unobtrusive telephoto lens while walking through Dublin is no problem. Note that if you want to sell images of people, you should get a model release form signed. Photography of Children\nOne thing worth mentioning is the über-careful rules and regulations laid down mainly in Northern Irish museums regarding photography. In effect, you will be asked not to take any pictures of children, a backlash of the prevalent pedophilia hysteria. Many places also ask you to fill in a form and sign it, agreeing to these conditions (though I have never been asked for ID when doing this, leading me to the thought that one could easily use fake names here). I would also caution against strolling into a park or playground and then starting to take images of children. “Concerned citizens” will, more than likely, soon be onto your case.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:6ce89ea0-fadc-4f49-865c-de2d78601d41>"]},{"passage":"You’re on a trip, and there it is before your eyes: the most beautiful, unique, interesting or amazing thing you’ve ever seen.

Talk to the staff at your local camera or electronics store to find the best camera for you – one that fits your needs and your budget. Be sure to buy any accessories you’ll need such as zoom lenses, carrying cases, adapters for chargers, or extra batteries. Practice makes perfect\nStudy your camera’s instruction manual. Many cameras come with instructional DVDs as well, and some camera retailers even offer free classes to customers. Play around with the settings on your camera to see how they affect each shot. The more you know about the different settings, the more options you have for controls like shutter speed (controls how fast the picture is taken), white balance (controls brightness) and aperture (controls how much light the lens lets in). Shoot from a variety of angles\nYou never know which angle will provide the perfect shot, so capture your subject from a variety of angles and vantage points, from far away to up close, outside or in, in the background or front and center, and all alone or in the context of its setting. This will also keep the whole collection fresh and interesting. Take pictures of both people and things\nYou in front of the Eiffel Tower. You in front of the Acropolis. You in front of the Berlin Wall. Seeing a pattern here? Of course, it’s nice to have lots of photos of yourself in front of places you’ve visited, but be sure to also take photos of just the location or monument from your viewpoint as well. It’ll break up the monotony while still serving as a potent reminder of your travels. Capture action and details\nCapture the action of a location, not just its still-life. Rather than only snapping shots of a market, get some photos of the sellers in action too. And in addition to a few shots of the people bustling around the stalls, get close up on some of the details. Varying these conditions can help bring a setting to life and make your photos more exciting. Learn to photograph people\nA certain amount of finesse is required for getting great photos of strangers. You want to capture the perfect shot, but don’t want to be intrusive. Unless you are shooting from far away, always ask the subject’s permission (for kids, ask the parents). Many people will jump at the chance to be photographed while others will become quite shy once the camera is pointed at them. Put your subject at ease before you start shooting, or engage them in conversation while another person takes the photos. Play with scale\nDepending on where you place one item in relation to other, you can create different effects with scale. Those silly photos where it looks like someone is about to push over the Leaning Tower of Pisa, for example, are just tricks of scale. In addition to creating effects, scale can convey a sense of the size of a place. To show just how large a rock is, have a person standing nearby. This helps the viewer better see its size. Take candid shots\nSome of a trip’s most memorable moments happen spontaneously. Be sure to take some candid shots in addition to all the posed portraits. A shot of your group laughing uproariously at a joke may invoke a much stronger memory of a particular place than any posed scenery shot ever could. Know when to put the camera down\nSometimes you just aren’t going to be able to get the perfect shot, no matter how hard you try.

If you are overstocked, have high levels of slow moving stock or obsolete stock, then you have invested cash without approval and you do not have an effective inventory policy. You wouldn’t let any other significant expenditure be made without a detailed approval process, so why inventory? Here are a few points on how to manage your inventory effectively. Make to Order (MTO) vs. Make to Stock (MTS)\nIf you are a manufacturing business then you should be carefully analysing the MTO and MTS. You should assess the frequency, value and volume of each product and then overlay this information with the commercial strategy. If a product is sold infrequently, generates low returns, and does not form part of a wider commercial offering, then it should not be MTS. In fact, it should probably be delisted altogether. It doesn’t make sense to invest your cash in all products equally. Isn’t it better to have more stock, and consequently a better service level, for those products that generate the most sales and the most revenue? This is the purpose of an ABC classification. An ABC classification, sometimes called ‘runners, repeaters, strangers’, is an opportunity to focus cash, and improved service levels, at the products that are critically important to your business. Broadly speaking your inventory targets should be comprised of two components, cycle stock and safety stock. Cycle stock is straightforward – it is the mean expected demand during the replenishment lead time. Safety stock is more complex, and often overlooked. Safety stock is a probability assessment of demand exceeding the mean during the replenishment lead time, combined with the probability of delays in the replenishment lead time. This should be properly calculated – rules of thumb do not work and will leave you with too little or too much stock. Devising an inventory policy is not a one-off exercise. As your business profile changes, new products will come in, old products will go out and sales will increase and decrease. These factors will impact your inventory targets and consequently you should be making revisions to your MTO\/MTS, portfolio classification and inventory targets periodically. If you do not have inventory management software then simple models can be developed in MS Excel to achieve this. Developing an inventory policy is not just about the known numbers; it is not purely an analytical exercise. You need to ensure that the analysis is overlaid with the expectations of the product life cycle, market promotions, sales strategies and commercial forecasts. It is important that there is cross-functional consensus from the commercial, finance and operations teams on the levels of inventory being targeted. Once you have an inventory policy established and a process for periodic review, then you should be looking at levers on how you can work to reduce stock. There are a number of methods you can use, but typically businesses should focus on:\n- Modifying service levels (reducing service against ‘B’ & ‘C’ class items);\n- Increasing MTO;\n- Introducing minimum order quantities (MOQs) for customers;\n- Negotiating higher frequency, lower volume deliveries with suppliers;\n- Rationalising the portfolio;\n- Improving forecasting and considering implementing Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP).\n\nPlus, as with any task where humans are involved, the risk of human error is potentially high, particularly if employees feel rushed to complete the process as quickly as possible to keep labor costs down. It’s also difficult to locate the source of any mismatched numbers in a periodic system because so much time passes between counts that it’s hard to know when and where the numbers became off. Smaller organizations tend to benefit more from periodic systems because the cost involved are more manageable with less inventory and fewer labor hours to consider. Perpetual inventory control systems take a different approach. Instead of only tracking inventory at periodic intervals, you track each item throughout its journey across your facility. From the moment you receive it, to the moment it is used in your operations, sold, or scrapped, it’s tracked. You get up-to-the-minute data on precisely where your items are and what they’re being used for. This data is gathered from sensors, barcodes, and scanners that keep tabs on items in real time, helping to eliminate errors from miscounts and helping your team pull inventory items more efficiently. The moment out-of-stock items are received and allocated to the proper bin, your team can be notified and begin using them immediately, instead of sitting on the shelf waiting for the next cycle count. The challenges of perpetual systems are different that those for periodic systems. Instead of needing large amounts of labor to perform counts, you need to invest money upfront in the sensors, barcodes, scanners, software, and other technology that helps you collect your data. And the more locations you have, the more equipment you need to buy. You’ll still need to perform cycle counts periodically to reconcile any incorrect numbers, but it’s far less often than with a periodic system. Ultimately, periodic inventory control systems are typically best suited for smaller organizations with few inventory items to manage and track. For larger companies with hundreds of items to keep track of, a perpetual control system is the more cost-effective option. How do I cost-effectively manage inventory? Alright so, you need to control you inventory to keep your costs down, but what’s the best way to do that? There are essentially three ways to manage inventory, regardless of what control system you use:\n- Paper checklists\n- Inventory management software\nEach system can be useful, but only one will help you keep costs down and improve your ROI. Let’s find out which one. Pen and paper checklists\nBelieve it or not, there are still many companies that attempt to manage their entire inventory with a pen and paper. This can work, if you are a very small business with just a few items that aren’t very critical to your operations. Doing everything by hand significantly increases the potential for human error and it requires a lot of time spent away from more productive tasks. The next step up from a pad of paper is spreadsheets. You can store an enormous amount of data in them, and your team can update them instantly as needed. The problem with spreadsheets is that when someone updates them, suddenly that specific version of the file is now the most up to date so if unless the next updates the exact same file, you no longer have a unified source of data. Spreadsheets still require manual updates and modifications so you’re still spending money for someone to keep that spreadsheet updated. While they can get the job done in some cases, spreadsheets are still not the most cost-effective way to manage complex inventories. Inventory management software\nData and automation are the tools of industry and are proven to help control costs and improve ROI. Apply these powerful tools to your inventory with inventory management software to get more from your inventory. With this software, you can implement a robust perpetual control system and track every item across your entire operation, even across multiple facilities. The best part about this is that you can instantly see where you inventory costs are going. Instead of waiting to reconcile your inventory accounting a few times a year, you can quickly tell which parts are not being used efficiently and which parts you aren’t using as much. In fact, most organizations don’t use as much as 90% of their MRO inventory every year and your software solution can show you what parts aren’t being utilized efficiently. Remember that money we were leaving on the table with inefficient purchasing and ordering methods for restocking inventory? Inventory management software helps ensure you don’t miss a single dollar.\n\nAre you looking for an effective way to manage and track inventory in your business?

Don’t deprive your business of the benefits of inventory management and start doing it today!\n\n5 Inventory Planning Best Practices\nIn a session we co-presented at the recent National Conference on Operations & Fulfillment in Las Vegas, we led a panel that delivered the following top five inventory planning best practices:\n- Build partnerships with suppliers. View your suppliers as subordinates and they’ll simply do your bidding. Work with them as partners and you’ll succeed together. You'll achieve more sales — with higher fulfillment, fewer overstocks and better inventory turnover — if you have a partner relationship with suppliers. Communicate with suppliers comprehensively and often. If they can anticipate your needs, they have a better chance of having raw materials and manufacturing capacity available when you need it. Establish these relationships so suppliers can tell you any bad news before delays in production or delivery impact your business. - Capture shadow or lost demand. Incomplete or inaccurate demand data leads to faulty demand planning and inaccurate purchasing decisions. What's more, it negatively impacts staff efficiency. Without accurate demand data, merchants can make incorrect decisions about strong vs. weak sellers. In addition, not capturing lost demand understates response rates and average order size, potentially impacting future list selection. - Measure both order and item fulfillment. Order fulfillment is the best measure of customer satisfaction. It gauges the percentage of customers that are shipped their orders complete at the time of order. The best measure of inventory buying performance is item fulfillment. This measures the percentage of individual items that are shipped to customers when ordered. Understand the relationship between the two so individual inventory buyers can comprehend their impact on total customer experience. - Forecast Internet demand. With Web sales growing to more than 50 percent of total sales for many catalogers, there's growing concern about how best to forecast. First, understand the true source of the demand. On average, only 10 percent to 20 percent of Internet demand is truly “incremental” and not driven by other media. There are two main approaches to online forecasting: time-phased modeling and traditional offer-based forecasting with demand curves. Both are valid. Ensure that you understand the marketing dynamics of your business to apply the appropriate mix of the two forecasting models. For details, see Ray Goodman’s March 2009 Catalog Success article, “Grab the Bull by Both Horns.”\n- Build processes for speed. Every day yields new information to consider. Success is directly related to the speed of receiving, processing and acting on new information. Whether it’s reforecasting demand, placing new purchase orders or adjusting existing ones, build systems and processes that maximize speed.

The key to an efficient and profitable business is total visibility into the inventory process from start to finish and management tools to help you maintain optimal stock levels year-round. An effective inventory management system helps you streamline all the moving parts of your warehouse: From recommending optimal stock levels all the way to keeping your supply chain organized and running smoothly. Learn the basics of inventory management and discover how an inventory management system can help you increase profitability and reduce waste. Inventory is usually one of the largest assets a company owns, which is why inventory mismanagement is one of the top reasons small businesses fail. Inefficient asset inventory management can decrease your profitability in several ways:\nHaving more stock on hand than you actually need can cost you. You have to pay for more warehouse space, which is expensive, and perishable items can spoil before you’re able to sell them. Staying ahead of the curve on retail trends helps you capitalize on the popular items customers want at the moment. If you’re slow to adapt to the changing market, however, customers will look elsewhere and you’ll surrender market share. Customers will order from somewhere else if you don’t have what they want in stock. At the very least, stockouts will cost you sales. If they happen often, you’ll lose customers. Investing in an inventory management system can yield excellent ROI. Not only does an inventory management system make it easier to get your products to the customers who want them, it can provide valuable insights so that you’re ordering the right inventory at the right time and in the right quantities. Here are some examples of how investing in inventory management pays off:\nOrder inventory in the right quantities at the right time so that you’re never over- or under-stocked. More productivity and less time wasted looking for missing items or tracking things by hand. Well-managed stock leads to more efficient and organized warehouses. Orders ship faster and are more accurate, leading to satisfied customers and upheld service level agreements. Inventory is considered a business asset, so inventory management ties in closely with accounting. When inventory and accounting are integrated well, you get real-time metrics into your goods at every step of the process. Your inventory management system should support multiple inventory valuation methods and functions such as:\nThe cost of goods sold divided by average inventory on hand. Low turnover rate indicates duplicate orders and deteriorating inventory value. High turnover rate can mean excess shipping costs to quickly replace things that are out of stock, incomplete orders, and wasted time trying to locate missing items. Balanced turnover rate indicates high efficiency, lower costs, and higher customer satisfaction. The cost of available goods for sale divided by the number of units for sale. This metric yields the weighted average cost per unit. Estimate of the expected cost for an item in the accounting records, which is periodically checked against the actual cost. The variance between the two numbers is recorded in the accounting records. This method is used when it’s too time-consuming to track actual costs in real time. Refers to the list of sub-items that make up a single inventory item. Bundling the parts and items that make up a single finished item. A logistics term that refers to receiving inventory just before or at the exact time it’s needed. Tracks inventory from manufacturing to when it’s used on the production shop or factory floor. Inventory management software tracks, manages, and organizes inventory levels, orders, sales, and deliveries. The purpose of inventory management software is to maintain an optimal inventory level, track goods during transport between locations, receive new items, manage warehouse processes such as picking, packing, and shipping, prevent product obsolescence and spoilage, and ensure your products are never out of stock. Software for inventory management automates what used to be a time-consuming, manual process of counting each item one by one and recording it on paper. Digitizing this process not only makes it more accurate, it saves valuable time. Core capabilities include inventory optimization, product identification and tracking, service management for service-oriented companies, asset tracking, and reorder points.\n\nChaouki M. Eid | Managing Director\n28th January, 2015\nEffective inventory management is aimed at finding the optimum between the high availability of inventory items (driven by customer service objectives) and the tied capital in order to reduce expenses (a financial objective); definitely two conflicting objectives. As a result, “Supply Chain” professionals are under constant pressure to reduce inventory and there are many reasons why. We have all heard of dead, slow moving, duplicate and overly stocked items sitting in warehouses where the cash could have been utilized somewhere else in the company to deliver profit instead of incurring carrying cost. While I must say a lot of progress has been made on this, keep in mind though that if at any point in the process the maintenance or production departments are unable to meet their schedules due to lack of operational\/maintenance parts or production material then all hell breaks loose. As such, “Supply Chain” professionals and more specifically “Inventory Control” in-charge are faced with this constant puzzle\/dilemma: “How to maintain effective Customer Service with the lowest Inventory Levels possible”; easier said than done. Hence what can be done? Before looking at solutions, we need to examine the following issues prior to taking any decision regarding when and how much to order:\nOnce we have had clear answers to the above, we need to scientifically calculate the ROP (Re-Order Point) for each Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) and strategize how to order. The ROP inventory replenishment technique considers forecasted demand over the replenishment lead time period, plus an allowance for safety stock. The ROP can be scientifically calculated depending on the situation. There are four distinct situations for calculating and setting the ROP, as follows:\nWhen the inventory level of an item goes down to a pre-specified minimum level (ROP), an “Economic Order Quantity” (EOQ) is ordered to replenish the system. This EOQ is intended to be a balanced quantity that optimizes both the purchasing cost and the carrying cost for the inventory hence keeping the total inventory cost to a minimum. The EOQ model finds the optimal order quantity keeping the above two constraints in mind. However, the EOQ model is not the best solution for all items. For very expensive items, the strategy could be to order the exact amount needed, while for cheap consumable items, buying in bulk makes more sense. On the other hand companies that employ a JIT (Just-In-Time) approach consider the EOQ as a waste since the purchased quantities ordered should only be the ones required for the next immediate schedule. Then you also have the blanket agreement option. Each of the above strategies has its own pros and cons depending on the situation and unfortunately there is no one single solution that fits all scenarios. As such, it becomes imperative that the right strategy be used for the corresponding situation. Last but not least, the inventory specialists should be accountable for the two most important and conflicting inventory KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) which are:\nChaouki Eid, Deputy Managing Director, Meirc Training & Consulting.

But what is inventory control? It includes the efficient management of purchasing, receiving, warehousing, tracking, shipping and reordering — and it’s how you maximize the return on your inventory. Why Is Inventory Control Important? Inventory can be the largest portion of your company’s assets and can affect your company’s cash flow. Inventory management that increases turnover and lowers investment can improve your cash flow. For example, if you reduced your $500,000 inventory to $450,000, that $50,000 difference could end up in your bank account. According to Investopedia, inventory carrying cost — that is, the expenses related to keeping and storing unsold goods, such as financing, insurance, taxes, transportation and shrinkage loss — is usually between 20% and 30% of an inventory’s value. So that $500,000 inventory could cost you $150,000 every year. Part of good inventory management is being sure you have enough stock to meet customer demand. Few things irritate a customer more than finding out that an item is out of stock after they’ve placed an order. Managing Inventory Control\nHere are seven tips for better inventory management. - Use ABC analysis. Classify the items in your inventory into three groups: A, B and C. Pay the strictest attention to A items, which are likely your most profitable high-ticket sellers. B items are moderately priced. C items are low-priced items with the highest turnover. - Follow the 80\/20 rule. The top 20% of your items will likely account for 80% of your profits. These will probably be your A items. Make sure they get the most attention. - Identify low-turnover items. If you haven’t sold a particular item in 12 months, it probably doesn’t belong in your inventory. - Set reorder points. When your stock of an item dips below a certain quantity, you’ll need to order more. Be sure to account for the lead time to replenish your stock. - Track stock levels. Pay attention to your stock levels as you approach reorder points. - Audit frequently. The more you audit and reconcile your inventory, the better you’ll be at managing it. - Use cloud-based software. Invest in inventory management software to make tracking and reordering easier. What is inventory control worth to your business? It could be a lot. Your inventory is a large investment, so treat it with the utmost care. A well-balanced inventory can ensure that you maintain a healthy cash flow without carrying extra costs.","passages":[{"passage":"Inventory is usually the biggest cash investment a business makes every year and if you do not have an inventory policy, then that cash investment has no approval process. If you are overstocked, have high levels of slow moving stock or obsolete stock, then you have invested cash without approval and you do not have an effective inventory policy. You wouldn’t let any other significant expenditure be made without a detailed approval process, so why inventory? Here are a few points on how to manage your inventory effectively. Make to Order (MTO) vs. Make to Stock (MTS)\nIf you are a manufacturing business then you should be carefully analysing the MTO and MTS. You should assess the frequency, value and volume of each product and then overlay this information with the commercial strategy. If a product is sold infrequently, generates low returns, and does not form part of a wider commercial offering, then it should not be MTS. In fact, it should probably be delisted altogether. It doesn’t make sense to invest your cash in all products equally. Isn’t it better to have more stock, and consequently a better service level, for those products that generate the most sales and the most revenue? This is the purpose of an ABC classification. An ABC classification, sometimes called ‘runners, repeaters, strangers’, is an opportunity to focus cash, and improved service levels, at the products that are critically important to your business. Broadly speaking your inventory targets should be comprised of two components, cycle stock and safety stock. Cycle stock is straightforward – it is the mean expected demand during the replenishment lead time. Safety stock is more complex, and often overlooked. Safety stock is a probability assessment of demand exceeding the mean during the replenishment lead time, combined with the probability of delays in the replenishment lead time. This should be properly calculated – rules of thumb do not work and will leave you with too little or too much stock. Devising an inventory policy is not a one-off exercise. As your business profile changes, new products will come in, old products will go out and sales will increase and decrease. These factors will impact your inventory targets and consequently you should be making revisions to your MTO\/MTS, portfolio classification and inventory targets periodically. If you do not have inventory management software then simple models can be developed in MS Excel to achieve this. Developing an inventory policy is not just about the known numbers; it is not purely an analytical exercise. You need to ensure that the analysis is overlaid with the expectations of the product life cycle, market promotions, sales strategies and commercial forecasts. It is important that there is cross-functional consensus from the commercial, finance and operations teams on the levels of inventory being targeted. Once you have an inventory policy established and a process for periodic review, then you should be looking at levers on how you can work to reduce stock. There are a number of methods you can use, but typically businesses should focus on:\n- Modifying service levels (reducing service against ‘B’ & ‘C’ class items);\n- Increasing MTO;\n- Introducing minimum order quantities (MOQs) for customers;\n- Negotiating higher frequency, lower volume deliveries with suppliers;\n- Rationalising the portfolio;\n- Improving forecasting and considering implementing Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP).","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:092907a1-da56-46d8-baf7-0b2189d01c52>"]},{"passage":"Plus, as with any task where humans are involved, the risk of human error is potentially high, particularly if employees feel rushed to complete the process as quickly as possible to keep labor costs down. It’s also difficult to locate the source of any mismatched numbers in a periodic system because so much time passes between counts that it’s hard to know when and where the numbers became off. Smaller organizations tend to benefit more from periodic systems because the cost involved are more manageable with less inventory and fewer labor hours to consider. Perpetual inventory control systems take a different approach. Instead of only tracking inventory at periodic intervals, you track each item throughout its journey across your facility. From the moment you receive it, to the moment it is used in your operations, sold, or scrapped, it’s tracked. You get up-to-the-minute data on precisely where your items are and what they’re being used for. This data is gathered from sensors, barcodes, and scanners that keep tabs on items in real time, helping to eliminate errors from miscounts and helping your team pull inventory items more efficiently. The moment out-of-stock items are received and allocated to the proper bin, your team can be notified and begin using them immediately, instead of sitting on the shelf waiting for the next cycle count. The challenges of perpetual systems are different that those for periodic systems. Instead of needing large amounts of labor to perform counts, you need to invest money upfront in the sensors, barcodes, scanners, software, and other technology that helps you collect your data. And the more locations you have, the more equipment you need to buy. You’ll still need to perform cycle counts periodically to reconcile any incorrect numbers, but it’s far less often than with a periodic system. Ultimately, periodic inventory control systems are typically best suited for smaller organizations with few inventory items to manage and track. For larger companies with hundreds of items to keep track of, a perpetual control system is the more cost-effective option. How do I cost-effectively manage inventory? Alright so, you need to control you inventory to keep your costs down, but what’s the best way to do that? There are essentially three ways to manage inventory, regardless of what control system you use:\n- Paper checklists\n- Inventory management software\nEach system can be useful, but only one will help you keep costs down and improve your ROI. Let’s find out which one. Pen and paper checklists\nBelieve it or not, there are still many companies that attempt to manage their entire inventory with a pen and paper. This can work, if you are a very small business with just a few items that aren’t very critical to your operations. Doing everything by hand significantly increases the potential for human error and it requires a lot of time spent away from more productive tasks. The next step up from a pad of paper is spreadsheets. You can store an enormous amount of data in them, and your team can update them instantly as needed. The problem with spreadsheets is that when someone updates them, suddenly that specific version of the file is now the most up to date so if unless the next updates the exact same file, you no longer have a unified source of data. Spreadsheets still require manual updates and modifications so you’re still spending money for someone to keep that spreadsheet updated. While they can get the job done in some cases, spreadsheets are still not the most cost-effective way to manage complex inventories. Inventory management software\nData and automation are the tools of industry and are proven to help control costs and improve ROI. Apply these powerful tools to your inventory with inventory management software to get more from your inventory. With this software, you can implement a robust perpetual control system and track every item across your entire operation, even across multiple facilities. The best part about this is that you can instantly see where you inventory costs are going. Instead of waiting to reconcile your inventory accounting a few times a year, you can quickly tell which parts are not being used efficiently and which parts you aren’t using as much. In fact, most organizations don’t use as much as 90% of their MRO inventory every year and your software solution can show you what parts aren’t being utilized efficiently. Remember that money we were leaving on the table with inefficient purchasing and ordering methods for restocking inventory?

View your suppliers as subordinates and they’ll simply do your bidding. Work with them as partners and you’ll succeed together. You'll achieve more sales — with higher fulfillment, fewer overstocks and better inventory turnover — if you have a partner relationship with suppliers. Communicate with suppliers comprehensively and often. If they can anticipate your needs, they have a better chance of having raw materials and manufacturing capacity available when you need it. Establish these relationships so suppliers can tell you any bad news before delays in production or delivery impact your business. - Capture shadow or lost demand. Incomplete or inaccurate demand data leads to faulty demand planning and inaccurate purchasing decisions. What's more, it negatively impacts staff efficiency. Without accurate demand data, merchants can make incorrect decisions about strong vs. weak sellers. In addition, not capturing lost demand understates response rates and average order size, potentially impacting future list selection. - Measure both order and item fulfillment. Order fulfillment is the best measure of customer satisfaction. It gauges the percentage of customers that are shipped their orders complete at the time of order. The best measure of inventory buying performance is item fulfillment. This measures the percentage of individual items that are shipped to customers when ordered. Understand the relationship between the two so individual inventory buyers can comprehend their impact on total customer experience. - Forecast Internet demand. With Web sales growing to more than 50 percent of total sales for many catalogers, there's growing concern about how best to forecast. First, understand the true source of the demand. On average, only 10 percent to 20 percent of Internet demand is truly “incremental” and not driven by other media. There are two main approaches to online forecasting: time-phased modeling and traditional offer-based forecasting with demand curves. Both are valid. Ensure that you understand the marketing dynamics of your business to apply the appropriate mix of the two forecasting models. For details, see Ray Goodman’s March 2009 Catalog Success article, “Grab the Bull by Both Horns.”\n- Build processes for speed. Every day yields new information to consider.

An effective inventory management system helps you streamline all the moving parts of your warehouse: From recommending optimal stock levels all the way to keeping your supply chain organized and running smoothly. Learn the basics of inventory management and discover how an inventory management system can help you increase profitability and reduce waste. Inventory is usually one of the largest assets a company owns, which is why inventory mismanagement is one of the top reasons small businesses fail. Inefficient asset inventory management can decrease your profitability in several ways:\nHaving more stock on hand than you actually need can cost you. You have to pay for more warehouse space, which is expensive, and perishable items can spoil before you’re able to sell them. Staying ahead of the curve on retail trends helps you capitalize on the popular items customers want at the moment. If you’re slow to adapt to the changing market, however, customers will look elsewhere and you’ll surrender market share. Customers will order from somewhere else if you don’t have what they want in stock. At the very least, stockouts will cost you sales. If they happen often, you’ll lose customers. Investing in an inventory management system can yield excellent ROI. Not only does an inventory management system make it easier to get your products to the customers who want them, it can provide valuable insights so that you’re ordering the right inventory at the right time and in the right quantities. Here are some examples of how investing in inventory management pays off:\nOrder inventory in the right quantities at the right time so that you’re never over- or under-stocked. More productivity and less time wasted looking for missing items or tracking things by hand. Well-managed stock leads to more efficient and organized warehouses. Orders ship faster and are more accurate, leading to satisfied customers and upheld service level agreements. Inventory is considered a business asset, so inventory management ties in closely with accounting. When inventory and accounting are integrated well, you get real-time metrics into your goods at every step of the process. Your inventory management system should support multiple inventory valuation methods and functions such as:\nThe cost of goods sold divided by average inventory on hand. Low turnover rate indicates duplicate orders and deteriorating inventory value. High turnover rate can mean excess shipping costs to quickly replace things that are out of stock, incomplete orders, and wasted time trying to locate missing items. Balanced turnover rate indicates high efficiency, lower costs, and higher customer satisfaction. The cost of available goods for sale divided by the number of units for sale. This metric yields the weighted average cost per unit. Estimate of the expected cost for an item in the accounting records, which is periodically checked against the actual cost. The variance between the two numbers is recorded in the accounting records. This method is used when it’s too time-consuming to track actual costs in real time.

There are four distinct situations for calculating and setting the ROP, as follows:\nWhen the inventory level of an item goes down to a pre-specified minimum level (ROP), an “Economic Order Quantity” (EOQ) is ordered to replenish the system. This EOQ is intended to be a balanced quantity that optimizes both the purchasing cost and the carrying cost for the inventory hence keeping the total inventory cost to a minimum. The EOQ model finds the optimal order quantity keeping the above two constraints in mind. However, the EOQ model is not the best solution for all items. For very expensive items, the strategy could be to order the exact amount needed, while for cheap consumable items, buying in bulk makes more sense. On the other hand companies that employ a JIT (Just-In-Time) approach consider the EOQ as a waste since the purchased quantities ordered should only be the ones required for the next immediate schedule. Then you also have the blanket agreement option. Each of the above strategies has its own pros and cons depending on the situation and unfortunately there is no one single solution that fits all scenarios. As such, it becomes imperative that the right strategy be used for the corresponding situation. Last but not least, the inventory specialists should be accountable for the two most important and conflicting inventory KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) which are:\nChaouki Eid, Deputy Managing Director, Meirc Training & Consulting.

But what is inventory control? It includes the efficient management of purchasing, receiving, warehousing, tracking, shipping and reordering — and it’s how you maximize the return on your inventory. Why Is Inventory Control Important? Inventory can be the largest portion of your company’s assets and can affect your company’s cash flow. Inventory management that increases turnover and lowers investment can improve your cash flow. For example, if you reduced your $500,000 inventory to $450,000, that $50,000 difference could end up in your bank account. According to Investopedia, inventory carrying cost — that is, the expenses related to keeping and storing unsold goods, such as financing, insurance, taxes, transportation and shrinkage loss — is usually between 20% and 30% of an inventory’s value. So that $500,000 inventory could cost you $150,000 every year. Part of good inventory management is being sure you have enough stock to meet customer demand. Few things irritate a customer more than finding out that an item is out of stock after they’ve placed an order. Managing Inventory Control\nHere are seven tips for better inventory management. - Use ABC analysis. Classify the items in your inventory into three groups: A, B and C. Pay the strictest attention to A items, which are likely your most profitable high-ticket sellers. B items are moderately priced. C items are low-priced items with the highest turnover. - Follow the 80\/20 rule. The top 20% of your items will likely account for 80% of your profits. These will probably be your A items. Make sure they get the most attention. - Identify low-turnover items. If you haven’t sold a particular item in 12 months, it probably doesn’t belong in your inventory. - Set reorder points. When your stock of an item dips below a certain quantity, you’ll need to order more. Be sure to account for the lead time to replenish your stock. - Track stock levels. Pay attention to your stock levels as you approach reorder points. - Audit frequently. The more you audit and reconcile your inventory, the better you’ll be at managing it. - Use cloud-based software. Invest in inventory management software to make tracking and reordering easier. What is inventory control worth to your business? It could be a lot. Your inventory is a large investment, so treat it with the utmost care. A well-balanced inventory can ensure that you maintain a healthy cash flow without carrying extra costs.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:4062e551-14e8-4e85-8b14-fe7f97e87872>"]}]}

During this legislative session, Sen. Randi Becker R-Eatonville, proposed a bill that would allow 20 school districts of up to 2,200 students to use the four-day school week. Here, Don Kordosky, superintendent of Oregon's Oakridge School District, shares his personal experience and insights on making the switch. When considering the switch from a five-day school week to a four-day school week, one need only recall that classic saying: “Less is more.”\nAs superintendent of Oakridge School District in Oregon, I learned this through personal experience when my schools made the switch. Initially, I was against the idea. How could a four-day week possibly be in the best interest of students? But after doing the research and seeing the benefits firsthand, I became a complete supporter. The positives of the four-day week far outweigh the negatives, and the negatives can all be alleviated through well-thought-out strategies. The parents of our students, the staff, the school board, and the entire community of Oakridge reviewed the four-day week for an entire year prior to implementation. Since implementation I have become a four-day week advocate because of all the positive attributes including: better student academic performance, increased teacher vitality, increased student engagement, decreased student discipline problems, and an improvement to the overall culture of excellence for the district. Most school districts originally begin a review of the four-day school week as a strategy to address financial shortfalls. (Mine did not.) By trimming one day off the week, a school can save in bus services, cafeteria, and facilities costs. This can be especially crucial during state budget shortfalls, where K-12 funding can be in danger of cuts, and even more so for rural school districts, which must run their schools on a minimal budget. But not all school districts go to a four-day week because of money, and certainly it is not the only way a school can benefit from the change. The four-day week is not for all districts, and there are negative attributes that need to have alleviation strategies in place prior to implementation. Negative attributes include parent fears of not being able to find child care on Fridays, fatigue for students that have to attend school for longer days, and decreases in compensation for employees who lose hours. An example of an alleviation strategy for the child care concern is the offering of Red Cross Childcare First Aid certification classes for high school students. These students then became available for parents who could not find relatives or other child care on Fridays. Another strategy is offering extra duty employment for bus drivers, cooks, and custodians, who all lose significant hours. In our district we made it a practice to offer all paid athletic supervision and activity duties to the employees who lost work time prior to other employees. Regardless of the negative consequence associated with the four-day week, there are strategies to alleviate the negative impact on students, families and staff. Of note, many parents have found that eliminating the large number of half-days for students that plague five-day weeks — such as teacher work days, curriculum days, grading days, inservice days, etc. — has made finding childcare easier. With the four-day week, teachers can do their non-teaching activities on the day off, and therefore schools do not have to send children home at awkward and inconsistent times. However, what I have found is that most common four-day school week objections are derived more from a fear of change (and a indeed a reasonable concern) rather than empirical study. When scrutinized, these objections are both addressed and debunked by the switch. To demonstrate that point, here are four reasons why the four-day school week is an improvement to the five-day week. Teacher and student attendance increases. Teachers are the key to student learning, and having the regular classroom teacher in the room instead of a substitute teacher is better for kids. Because teachers are able to schedule meetings, doctor’s appointments and other possible conflicts with their teaching schedule on the extra day off, teachers are better able to provide a consistency for students. In Oakridge, the number of available work hours missed by teachers decreased significantly (21.8%) after the move to a four-day school week. Student attendance typically increases, too.\n\nMost districts that implement a four-day week see substantial improvement in attendance at the high school level per available instructional hours (they spend more time learning, but less days at school). Attendance in some schools increased 3% as measured against available instructional hours. Contrary to fears, instructional time for students can increase from what it was before if it is the wish of the school district. By subtracting non-teaching activities from Fridays (lunch time, passing periods, transportation time, recess) and adding those paid teacher work hours to instructional hours Monday-Thursday, the amount of paid teacher time that is allocated to instruction increases. Each school day is comprised of many activities that have no direct positive correlation to student academic achievement. The time we pay teachers when they are not teaching includes before school starts (usually about 30 minutes), the time that society pays teachers after school (usually 45 minutes), passing periods (typically six passing periods of five minutes each equals 30 minutes). All of this “non-instructional time” on Fridays is eliminated and that time can be changed to instructional time on the other remaining four days. Also, the flexibility of the four-day week allows it to work around national holidays, so even if a Monday needs to be taken off — say, for Labor Day — students can still go to school for four days (Monday-Friday). The four-day school week offers four days of instruction every week, not the inconsistency of the five-day week which often has only three, three and one-half, or four days of student instruction. This is one of the keys to the four-day week: Instead of sending kids home so that teachers can do non-instructional duties you bring teachers in on Fridays to complete non-instructional tasks! On the four-day week, student discipline decreases and student engagement increases. The commonly assumed reason for the decrease in student discipline is that students are more actively engaged in more strenuous and rigorous classes than on a five-day week. Keep in mind that student seat time typically increases in the move from a five-day week to a four-day week, so claims that student discipline incidents decrease because they are in school for less time is not a viable argument. Also, teachers commonly reflect upon the change from a five-day to a four-day week that students work harder, are engaged more, and learn more. Teachers have noted that there is increased intrinsic motivation to cover material in fewer days with more instructional time, and that students adjust to increased expectations by becoming more engaged. Moreover, the extra instructional time allows teachers to better teach more complicated subjects, which can otherwise be a problem especially in math and sciences. Perhaps most importantly, teacher vitality and morale increases tremendously. Teaching is an extremely difficult job, where it is common for teachers to spend long nights and weekends assessing student work and preparing. Any teacher worth their salt does not work only “to the contract” work hours, but does everything they can in their non-working hours to provide as many learning opportunities for their students as possible. On a five-day week it is not uncommon to see teachers work late on Friday nights grading and assessing the week’s student work. Saturdays are often spent working on preparation for the next week’s worth of lessons, leaving Sundays to reinvigorate and spend time with their families. As a result, teachers often start the school year each September bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, ready to face new challenges. But by February, many become exhausted. The four-day week, even though each instructional day is longer, provides three days for teachers to complete needed work and spend some much-needed time with their families. This simple fact increases teacher morale, decreases teacher turnover, and improves teacher vitality. This leads to happier and more energetic teachers, which results in better education for students. Don't let nostalgia for an antiquated tradition cloud your mind — take a few minutes and read about the four-day week and get the facts. Plan for the negative attributes, maximize the positive attributes, and make sure that the community is thoroughly involved in the implementation process. The best way to ensure the failure of the implementation of the four-day week is to “do it to the community, instead of “doing it with the community.”\n\nFour-Day School Week Is on the Rise, Story Says\nThe idea of a four-day school week is nothing new. It's long been embraced by some small, rural school districts. But a new Associated Press story suggests the practice is spreading amid budget pressures on school systems. Featured is a 4,000-student rural district in Peach County, Ga., where school officials reportedly shifted last year to a four-day schedule to help fill a $1 million budget shortfall. What's intriguing is that both student attendance and standardized test scores have since improved. (Apparently, each school day is longer to make up for lost time.) Across the country, more than 120 districts operate on a four-day week, the AP story says. (If only employers of education journalists would embrace this idea!) Also, over the past couple of years, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Maine have changed state law so that districts can count their academic year by hour rather than days, so that a four-day week is possible, the story says. Nevertheless, the story also identifies an Oklahoma district that plans to switch back to a five-day week, after school officials decided the approach wasn't working well for students or teachers. For a more detailed exploration of a four-day school week, check out this 2008 analysis from the Council on State Governments. Also, I came across a helpful research brief issued last year by the Center for Education Policy, Applied Research, and Evaluation at the University of Southern Maine. It notes that little research has been conducted on the impact of moving to a four-day school week on financial savings, student achievement, or other matters. \"As noted by many observers, the literature that exists on the four-day school\nweek is mainly positive, but not often peer-reviewed or scientifically based, and few summaries of this literature provide any critical analysis of the results,\" the report says. On the question of student achievement, the report says the shorter week does not appear to have a negative effect, but again cautions that much of the literature reviewed was not held to professional scrutiny. One of the most positive and ubiquitous findings from existing research, the report finds, is improved teacher and student attendance. Finally, the University of Southern Maine's analysis cautions that the actual financial savings from cutting a day out of the school week doesn't always live up to expectations, particularly if personnel costs are not reduced. The savings generally are seen in such areas as transportation, food services, and energy costs.\n\nDriven by hopes of cutting transportation, heating and staff costs, more and more school systems are moving to a four-day school week. Small, rural school districts have been in the vanguard of this trend, but larger urban districts are also making the shift. Right now at least twenty US states have one or more school districts operating on a four-day week, including California, Arizona and Michigan. Though shorter school weeks have been implemented from time to time in the US since the 1930s, and briefly became widespread during the “energy crisis” of the 1970s, definitive studies and reports on the impact of the shortened school week are few. This research brief is one of many that indicate that the change can often improve attendance and morale for both students and teachers. Some proponents even tout improved academic performance; especially where cost savings might forestall teacher layoffs or larger class sizes. (Most evaluations indicate that there is no net effect on achievement, though some reports have shown reduced test scores.) Opponents raise concerns about how long, tiring days in the classroom will affect young children, and point to the burdens placed on working parents to find costly daycare. What is the impact of the four-day week on tutors and tutoring? There may be some downsides the overall effect is likely to be positive. Most encouraging is the fact that some districts instituting a four-day week are explicitly inviting students who need extra help to come to school on their “off day” for tutoring sessions. In some cases, schools are reinvesting the money they’re saving to create tutoring opportunities, such as hiring one-on-one tutors for academic underachievers. Similarly, when the school system in Georgia’s Peach County moved to a four-day week, several community organizations (including Boys and Girls clubs and a church) began offering affordable tutoring on Mondays (their “off day”) for only $10 to $15. Will students have less time and energy after school for tutoring on the days when they attend classes? Some tutors may need to shift their schedules to connect with learners on their off day or on weekends – possibly making for some intensely busy days for tutors. But most schools are pushing dismissal ahead by no more than an hour, while reducing lunch and recess times. So after-school tutoring opportunities might not be adversely impacted. Tutors who connect with students online or “on demand” might benefit from an increase in business as learners move to fit tutoring into their new school-day schedules. For example, tutors who can support “digital learners” who want to learn anytime, anyplace, at their own pace, may take yet more business from traditional tutoring services due to the shorter school week. The “bottom line” for tutors is that shortening the school week can potentially create new opportunities: first by opening up a “tutoring day” on Monday or Friday, and second through increased demand for services in areas where schools are hiring tutors. As always, those who can adapt their offerings to the changing needs of students and their families will be positioned to make the most of the situation. Featured photo courtesy of Jean Valley.

Could a four-day school week help solve these problems? Colorado School District 27J made national news when it officially cut Mondays from its school schedule in August 2018. District 27J receives one of the lowest levels of funding in the Denver metropolitan area and struggles to retain teachers as a result. But since switching to the new schedule, the district has enticed teachers from other districts to transfer to 27J. The transition also added US$1 million back into the district’s operating budget, part of which was spent on a Chromebook for every middle and high school student in the district. Though the new schedule met mixed reviews from parents and community members, studies show the shorter week significantly improves the health and happiness of students and teachers. - Colorado schools must meet a minimum quota of 1,080 hours of instruction each school year. - The average school day on a modified schedule lasts for seven and a half to eight hours, compared to the standard six-hour day. - School districts looking to switch to a schedule of less than 160 days must obtain approval from Colorado’s Commissioner of Education. - Not all schools within a district operate on the same schedule. - Schools on a four-day week schedule can save as much as 20 percent on transportation costs and food service programmes. 4-DAY SCHOOL WEEK: Do you think school districts in Southern California should do this? https:\/\/t.co\/CFZboAUyeA\n— ABC7 Eyewitness News (@ABC7) 16 May 2019\nA brief history of Colorado’s four-day school week\nIn Colorado, four-day weeks and schedules shorter than 160 days aren’t new. In fact, some Colorado schools have operated on a shorter schedule since the 1980-1981 academic school year. In 1980, a state law was passed that allowed school districts to operate on alternative schedules. That same academic year, three school districts moved to a four-day school week. The following academic year, 12 school districts made the switch. Unsurprisingly, for many school districts, cutting costs was the main reason behind the switch. The state’s information manual acknowledges that some schools cut a day from the school week due to the 2008 energy crisis. Spreading like wildfire\nAs of the 2019-2020 school year, 109 school districts in Colorado, which account for over 60 percent of the state’s school districts, have switched to a shorter schedule. Just one year after District J27 adopted the new schedule, five additional school districts applied to switch. The state department of education’s official manual on the four-day school week reports that this new schedule is immensely popular among students and teachers. Between 80 and 90 percent of community members prefer the four-day school week for many reasons, including more time to spend with family, more time to plan lessons, and increased teacher recruitment and retention rates. Recent studies on the four-day school week found that a shorter school week also improves student performance. One study found that more fourth- and fifth-grade students in rural districts operating on a four-day week scored at the proficient or advanced level in mathematics and reading tests:\n“These positive effects…suggest there is little evidence that switching to a four-day week harms student performance,” the study concludes. Consider the students\nStudents all around the world are feeling the pressure to do well in school. In England, 65 percent of students aged 12 to 16 list school as their primary source of stress, compared to 83 percent of students aged 16 and older. In Australia, 26 percent of kids report school is one of the main sources of their anxiety. In America, students as young as eight years old worry about making good grades and getting into college. School is taking its toll on their lives outside of the classroom, too. Nearly half of American students experience difficulty sleeping, with one in three children experiencing regular headaches. Cutting a day from the school week would give students more time to play, bond with their family and engage in extracurricular activities, including sports, volunteering and working. Consider the parents\nNot all parents are thrilled about the change, however – especially those who work on Mondays. To accommodate parents’ need for childcare services and relieve some of the financial burden, daily childcare services provided by District J27 have accompanied the new school week. This service currently costs US$30 per day, but a scholarship is available for low-income families which covers the cost.\n\nAlternative Start Times for Schools\nIn the U.S., school calendar reform is gaining popularity with more schools experimenting with year round calendars, four-day school weeks, balanced calendars and later start times in an attempt to increase student achievement, cut costs, or improve the overall educational environment for teachers and students. Alternative start times are also in consideration in middle and high schools where teenage students need more sleep than younger students. While more instructional time cannot guarantee improved student achievement, many schools are finding beneficial results by implementing longer school days or longer school years. Many schools use extended learning time to increase the time available for core subject areas by either adding electives or credit recovery programs, making core subject classes longer, adding hours to the school day and even holding periodic Saturday classes. Extended school options can help students advance toward their post-secondary plans because they are allowed more time to earn college credit and gain internship or work experiences. A study on extended time in schools conducted by Massachusetts 2020 in 2005 looked at high performing high schools in Massachusetts and found that of the top performing schools, 50 percent have a school calendar longer than 180 days, and 80 percent have a school week longer than 32.5 hours. It seems that more time in school -- with either more hours in the day or more days of the year -- is positively linked to increased student achievement. Later Start Times\nThe impact of start times is greater for older students. Evidence links school start times to academic performance, and most studies have found later start times can improve student achievement. Assistant Professor of Economics at Colby College Finley Edwards published his study of start times' effect on middle school students in an article \"Do Schools Begin Too Early?\" The study was conducted in Wake County, North Carolina, as researchers examined how start times affected the performance of students on standardized tests. The results showed that by delaying start times by one hour, students experienced an increase of at least 2 percentage points in math and 1 percentage point in reading. Hormonal changes and increased need for more hours of sleep affect students' performance, so many educational experts feel that later start times would allow students to get more sleep and be more productive throughout the school day. Schools on four-day schedules attend the same amount of days in the year as traditional schedules but have longer school days, attending for an average of eight hours over the traditional 6.5 hours. Benefits to this schedule include increased student and teacher morale, reduced cost in transportation, and additional time for remediation. Drawbacks include childcare concerns and burnout over the course of longer school days. Year Round and Balanced Calendars\nYear-round calendars typically follow the start and end times of traditional schedules, but instead of a three month summer break, there are increments of breaks worked into the school year. Most schools follow a 45 days on\/15 days off schedule. A balanced calendar schedule reduces the length of the summer break by reapportioning those days throughout the school year. This means more frequent breaks with shorter periods of in-session days. The balanced and year-round calendar still follow the traditional 180 days of instruction, but instead of longer periods of in-session days and longer periods of vacation days, these times are balanced throughout the year to avoid long periods of either in-session or vacation days. These calendars can work, but the problem is that U.S. students are falling behind in global competition with other students. Multiple factors contribute to the falling behind of American students, but reforming the traditional American school calendar and start times could be the answer. - Photos.com\/Photos.com\/Getty Images\n\nYou get just as many days off at a year-round school as you would at a traditional school, just at a year-round school, it’s spreaded out through the year rather than all in one big break (The Pros and Cons of Year-Round School). Short breaks gives time for kids to have a better education and avoids kids getting too board over the long break. Yeah, you wouldn’t get to have 3 week vacations, but who does? Some kids say that they get a break right when they need it and it’s refreshing to them and they’re ready to listen (The Pros and Cons of Year-Round School). It would be easier for them to pick up where they left\nAttending school on a year-round calendar or a traditional calendar is a huge debate in the school districts across the United States. It is mainly about which calendar is best for the students’ academics. Everyone is talking about whether to keep the traditional school calendar or switch to year-round school. Year-round schooling is moving away from the traditional three semesters with a long summer break to shorter semesters with more, but shorter holidays. Since this is an ongoing debate, there are both pros and cons of having a change happen. Across the United States lies 37,100 high schools; each school comes in their own shapes and sizes. Educators recently looked into whether or not lowering school size could help better these students. Results found that small high schools contain less violence incidents. Moreover, small high schools result in a wider array of student involvement. Nonetheless, small high schools offer only a limited amount of courses and extracurriculars that students can get involved in. His narrative shows this support and how having instruction in Spanish and English allows him to have higher academics. In less than ten years, one third of students attending public schools will not know English when starting Kindergarten. Are schools and teachers ready for this and will push for bilingual instruction? Is America ready for this? As for now, there is mixed perspectives. schools are experimenting with innovative ways to adapt, including switching to a four-day school week. As many as 100 school districts have implemented a four-day week, especially in Colorado where over one-third of their school districts have adopted this schedule. While you probably aren 't likely to hear students complain about having a three-day weekend every weekend, this potentially offers a lot of advantages: removing a day means spending 20 percent less on things like busing, food, and utilities--in theory. Reports have found actual savings to end up being somewhat paltry, ranging from 0.4 to 2.5 percent per year. Now on, Some critics are concerned that students may not remember the lessons from last week because of the longer weekend and negatively impact students attention during classes. The grades on the report cards in the United States are A-F’s. The A’s on the report card are the best, and it is telling the teacher, you passed that class, but the F’s means you failed. Many of the schools in the United States do not give out E’s as\n(“Year-round education: Is summer vacation over... forever?”). This is significant because a great deal of children that had summer vacations before year round schooling have lost it because of year round schooling. Another piece of evidence would be that people are losing educate that they get in summer. 71 percent of adults not just including parents state that kids get educate from lessons during the months of summer by pursuing, working, athletics, or attending camp (“Year-round education: Is summer vacation\nShould There Be Year Round School? Studies show that learning in year round school increases less than 1%. There are many reason why there should be year round school, but here are some reasons why there shouldn’t be year round school. Continue reading if you want to know why there shouldn’t be year round school. One reason why there shouldn’t be year round school is because kids need a break from school. Second it messes with students and parents schedule. Plus it ruins summer. Most schools go 180 days a year with breaks in between then you get out and can enjoy your summer June through July. With year round schools you still go the traditional 180 days, of course with breaks in between, but you have to go to school in the summer so all you get off in the summer is June. There are a lot of reasons why you shouldn’t go to a year round school, here are a few.\n\nThe discussion in the state legislature about saving money by having school four days a week , or nine days out of ten, warrants serious discussion. After all, as one person noted, we are no longer an agrarian society. Nope, we’re a society where there are lots of two-income households. So if the child is home one day a week, who stays home to watch him or her? This is already a scenario that takes place when a child is sick, if there is a school snow day, or other emergencies. For many households, this becomes a juggling act worthy of the finest circus. It’s fun to assume that “somebody else” will fill in the gap. But who? The Y? Some social service agency? Or, perhaps in some ironic twist, the schools? Of course, the solution that some families have been forced to use is create a society of unsupervised latchkey kids. Hey, it works so well for a couple hours a day, doesn’t it? What’s another few hours? Seriously, such a plan has its benefits in terms of energy savings. My concern, besides the longer school day with less attentiveness and kids who depend on school lunches five days a week, is how the school-home balance beam is navigated.\n\nDUNCAN: We have a significantly shorter school year: 20, 25, 30 days versus India, versus China, other places. Our students are at a competitive disadvantage. BOLDUAN: The major argument for extending school time is summer learning loss. Researchers have found students can lose about a month's worth of achievement during the summer break. ELENA SILVA, SENIOR POLICY ANALYST, EDUCATION SECTOR: It's particularly true for low income kids who don't have the opportunities that other kids have during those big breaks. BOLDUAN: But more time is no silver bullet for reform. Miami-Dade County Schools in Florida used an extended day program for three years, but dropped it because they didn't see improvement in test scores. Critics say it disrupts family life and is expensive. The Miami-Dade program cost more than $100 million. MARTA PEREZ, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD: The teachers were fatigued at the end of the day. The students were fatigued and unmotivated. BOLDUAN: Which is another criticism: It's not just time, but the quality of the extra time that matters. SILVA: One of the risks, of course, is that you end up extending time in school that aren't working well and that's, I think goes without saying that no one wants to extend bad time. (END VIDEO CLIP)\nFour-Day School Week\nAZUZ: So, year-round school is one idea. What about the opposite: less time in school? That's what a lot of districts are doing, canceling one day of classes and moving to a four-day school week. The reason behind this? Money. For example, schools in Georgia's Peach County needed to cut $800,000. Switching to a four-day week will save about half of that. Less school might sound great to you, but not to everyone. It means parents will have to figure out where their kids will go on the day they're not in school. And remember in that last report, the idea of learning loss when you're not in class? It's the same concern around the four-day week. Before We Go\nAZUZ: Well, finally today, we'd like you to unleash your inner-geek. This is something we should all be concerned about: alien invasion!

Got that too. Even a Sith lord couldn't stay away! AZUZ: We had some ideas for Darth Vader puns, but we didn't want to force anything. Wookie here, we've reached the end of today's show.

Research Questions 1 through 3 addressed district performance including teacher\/staff and student attendance, achievement on the state assessment in reading and math, and costs on utilities. Research Question 4 addressed stakeholder perception. Maslow’s hierarchy of needs theory and collective impact theory served as the foundation for this study. The purposive sample included 40 internal and external stakeholders. Data collected included archival documents, semistructured interviews, and a structured questionnaire. A quantitative trend analysis was conducted on archival documents. Qualitative thematic analysis was conducted on interview perception data and structured questionnaire data was recoded for frequency. Archival data revealed natural gas costs decreased, student attendance improved, teacher\/staff attendance declined, math scores dropped, reading scores were flat, and water\/electricity costs increased. Perception data revealed stakeholders felt a positive impact on student attendance; saving money on utilities; teacher PD time; part-time employment; family time; and morale and staff retention. Stakeholders felt negatively towards teacher collaboration time; student achievement; the longer school day; lack of structure, supervision, and nutritious meals on the off day; and the Monday federal holidays causing school to be in session only three days per week. Overall, data revealed that while perceptions varied, stakeholders preferred the four-day regardless of any negative impacts to the district. The implications for this study are a resource and lessons learned for district personnel seeking to eliminate a day of instruction for the purposes of saving money. |Commitee:||Griffith, Nathan, McNulty, Charles|\n|School:||Grand Canyon University|\n|School Location:||United States -- Arizona|\n|Source:||DAI-A 79\/08(E), Dissertation Abstracts International|\n|Subjects:||Educational leadership, Educational administration|\n|Keywords:||District performance, Four-day school week, Stakeholder perception|\nCopyright in each Dissertation and Thesis is retained by the author.

During this legislative session, Sen. Randi Becker R-Eatonville, proposed a bill that would allow 20 school districts of up to 2,200 students to use the four-day school week. Here, Don Kordosky, superintendent of Oregon's Oakridge School District, shares his personal experience and insights on making the switch. When considering the switch from a five-day school week to a four-day school week, one need only recall that classic saying: “Less is more.”\nAs superintendent of Oakridge School District in Oregon, I learned this through personal experience when my schools made the switch. Initially, I was against the idea. How could a four-day week possibly be in the best interest of students? But after doing the research and seeing the benefits firsthand, I became a complete supporter. The positives of the four-day week far outweigh the negatives, and the negatives can all be alleviated through well-thought-out strategies. The parents of our students, the staff, the school board, and the entire community of Oakridge reviewed the four-day week for an entire year prior to implementation. Since implementation I have become a four-day week advocate because of all the positive attributes including: better student academic performance, increased teacher vitality, increased student engagement, decreased student discipline problems, and an improvement to the overall culture of excellence for the district. Most school districts originally begin a review of the four-day school week as a strategy to address financial shortfalls. (Mine did not.) By trimming one day off the week, a school can save in bus services, cafeteria, and facilities costs. This can be especially crucial during state budget shortfalls, where K-12 funding can be in danger of cuts, and even more so for rural school districts, which must run their schools on a minimal budget. But not all school districts go to a four-day week because of money, and certainly it is not the only way a school can benefit from the change. The four-day week is not for all districts, and there are negative attributes that need to have alleviation strategies in place prior to implementation. Negative attributes include parent fears of not being able to find child care on Fridays, fatigue for students that have to attend school for longer days, and decreases in compensation for employees who lose hours. An example of an alleviation strategy for the child care concern is the offering of Red Cross Childcare First Aid certification classes for high school students. These students then became available for parents who could not find relatives or other child care on Fridays. Another strategy is offering extra duty employment for bus drivers, cooks, and custodians, who all lose significant hours. In our district we made it a practice to offer all paid athletic supervision and activity duties to the employees who lost work time prior to other employees. Regardless of the negative consequence associated with the four-day week, there are strategies to alleviate the negative impact on students, families and staff. Of note, many parents have found that eliminating the large number of half-days for students that plague five-day weeks — such as teacher work days, curriculum days, grading days, inservice days, etc. — has made finding childcare easier. With the four-day week, teachers can do their non-teaching activities on the day off, and therefore schools do not have to send children home at awkward and inconsistent times. However, what I have found is that most common four-day school week objections are derived more from a fear of change (and a indeed a reasonable concern) rather than empirical study. When scrutinized, these objections are both addressed and debunked by the switch. To demonstrate that point, here are four reasons why the four-day school week is an improvement to the five-day week. Teacher and student attendance increases. Teachers are the key to student learning, and having the regular classroom teacher in the room instead of a substitute teacher is better for kids. Because teachers are able to schedule meetings, doctor’s appointments and other possible conflicts with their teaching schedule on the extra day off, teachers are better able to provide a consistency for students. In Oakridge, the number of available work hours missed by teachers decreased significantly (21.8%) after the move to a four-day school week. Student attendance typically increases, too.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e211e027-e45b-4d40-9de0-8293e4a42775>"]},{"passage":"Most districts that implement a four-day week see substantial improvement in attendance at the high school level per available instructional hours (they spend more time learning, but less days at school). Attendance in some schools increased 3% as measured against available instructional hours. Contrary to fears, instructional time for students can increase from what it was before if it is the wish of the school district. By subtracting non-teaching activities from Fridays (lunch time, passing periods, transportation time, recess) and adding those paid teacher work hours to instructional hours Monday-Thursday, the amount of paid teacher time that is allocated to instruction increases. Each school day is comprised of many activities that have no direct positive correlation to student academic achievement. The time we pay teachers when they are not teaching includes before school starts (usually about 30 minutes), the time that society pays teachers after school (usually 45 minutes), passing periods (typically six passing periods of five minutes each equals 30 minutes). All of this “non-instructional time” on Fridays is eliminated and that time can be changed to instructional time on the other remaining four days. Also, the flexibility of the four-day week allows it to work around national holidays, so even if a Monday needs to be taken off — say, for Labor Day — students can still go to school for four days (Monday-Friday). The four-day school week offers four days of instruction every week, not the inconsistency of the five-day week which often has only three, three and one-half, or four days of student instruction. This is one of the keys to the four-day week: Instead of sending kids home so that teachers can do non-instructional duties you bring teachers in on Fridays to complete non-instructional tasks! On the four-day week, student discipline decreases and student engagement increases. The commonly assumed reason for the decrease in student discipline is that students are more actively engaged in more strenuous and rigorous classes than on a five-day week. Keep in mind that student seat time typically increases in the move from a five-day week to a four-day week, so claims that student discipline incidents decrease because they are in school for less time is not a viable argument. Also, teachers commonly reflect upon the change from a five-day to a four-day week that students work harder, are engaged more, and learn more. Teachers have noted that there is increased intrinsic motivation to cover material in fewer days with more instructional time, and that students adjust to increased expectations by becoming more engaged. Moreover, the extra instructional time allows teachers to better teach more complicated subjects, which can otherwise be a problem especially in math and sciences. Perhaps most importantly, teacher vitality and morale increases tremendously. Teaching is an extremely difficult job, where it is common for teachers to spend long nights and weekends assessing student work and preparing. Any teacher worth their salt does not work only “to the contract” work hours, but does everything they can in their non-working hours to provide as many learning opportunities for their students as possible. On a five-day week it is not uncommon to see teachers work late on Friday nights grading and assessing the week’s student work. Saturdays are often spent working on preparation for the next week’s worth of lessons, leaving Sundays to reinvigorate and spend time with their families. As a result, teachers often start the school year each September bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, ready to face new challenges. But by February, many become exhausted. The four-day week, even though each instructional day is longer, provides three days for teachers to complete needed work and spend some much-needed time with their families. This simple fact increases teacher morale, decreases teacher turnover, and improves teacher vitality. This leads to happier and more energetic teachers, which results in better education for students. Don't let nostalgia for an antiquated tradition cloud your mind — take a few minutes and read about the four-day week and get the facts. Plan for the negative attributes, maximize the positive attributes, and make sure that the community is thoroughly involved in the implementation process. The best way to ensure the failure of the implementation of the four-day week is to “do it to the community, instead of “doing it with the community.”","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e211e027-e45b-4d40-9de0-8293e4a42775>"]},{"passage":"Four-Day School Week Is on the Rise, Story Says\nThe idea of a four-day school week is nothing new. It's long been embraced by some small, rural school districts. But a new Associated Press story suggests the practice is spreading amid budget pressures on school systems. Featured is a 4,000-student rural district in Peach County, Ga., where school officials reportedly shifted last year to a four-day schedule to help fill a $1 million budget shortfall. What's intriguing is that both student attendance and standardized test scores have since improved. (Apparently, each school day is longer to make up for lost time.) Across the country, more than 120 districts operate on a four-day week, the AP story says. (If only employers of education journalists would embrace this idea!) Also, over the past couple of years, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Maine have changed state law so that districts can count their academic year by hour rather than days, so that a four-day week is possible, the story says. Nevertheless, the story also identifies an Oklahoma district that plans to switch back to a five-day week, after school officials decided the approach wasn't working well for students or teachers. For a more detailed exploration of a four-day school week, check out this 2008 analysis from the Council on State Governments. Also, I came across a helpful research brief issued last year by the Center for Education Policy, Applied Research, and Evaluation at the University of Southern Maine. It notes that little research has been conducted on the impact of moving to a four-day school week on financial savings, student achievement, or other matters. \"As noted by many observers, the literature that exists on the four-day school\nweek is mainly positive, but not often peer-reviewed or scientifically based, and few summaries of this literature provide any critical analysis of the results,\" the report says. On the question of student achievement, the report says the shorter week does not appear to have a negative effect, but again cautions that much of the literature reviewed was not held to professional scrutiny. One of the most positive and ubiquitous findings from existing research, the report finds, is improved teacher and student attendance. Finally, the University of Southern Maine's analysis cautions that the actual financial savings from cutting a day out of the school week doesn't always live up to expectations, particularly if personnel costs are not reduced. The savings generally are seen in such areas as transportation, food services, and energy costs.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:39e4263e-6eb5-4a7f-90a9-a501eac204e9>"]},{"passage":"Driven by hopes of cutting transportation, heating and staff costs, more and more school systems are moving to a four-day school week. Small, rural school districts have been in the vanguard of this trend, but larger urban districts are also making the shift. Right now at least twenty US states have one or more school districts operating on a four-day week, including California, Arizona and Michigan. Though shorter school weeks have been implemented from time to time in the US since the 1930s, and briefly became widespread during the “energy crisis” of the 1970s, definitive studies and reports on the impact of the shortened school week are few. This research brief is one of many that indicate that the change can often improve attendance and morale for both students and teachers. Some proponents even tout improved academic performance; especially where cost savings might forestall teacher layoffs or larger class sizes. (Most evaluations indicate that there is no net effect on achievement, though some reports have shown reduced test scores.) Opponents raise concerns about how long, tiring days in the classroom will affect young children, and point to the burdens placed on working parents to find costly daycare. What is the impact of the four-day week on tutors and tutoring? There may be some downsides the overall effect is likely to be positive. Most encouraging is the fact that some districts instituting a four-day week are explicitly inviting students who need extra help to come to school on their “off day” for tutoring sessions. In some cases, schools are reinvesting the money they’re saving to create tutoring opportunities, such as hiring one-on-one tutors for academic underachievers. Similarly, when the school system in Georgia’s Peach County moved to a four-day week, several community organizations (including Boys and Girls clubs and a church) began offering affordable tutoring on Mondays (their “off day”) for only $10 to $15. Will students have less time and energy after school for tutoring on the days when they attend classes? Some tutors may need to shift their schedules to connect with learners on their off day or on weekends – possibly making for some intensely busy days for tutors. But most schools are pushing dismissal ahead by no more than an hour, while reducing lunch and recess times. So after-school tutoring opportunities might not be adversely impacted. Tutors who connect with students online or “on demand” might benefit from an increase in business as learners move to fit tutoring into their new school-day schedules. For example, tutors who can support “digital learners” who want to learn anytime, anyplace, at their own pace, may take yet more business from traditional tutoring services due to the shorter school week. The “bottom line” for tutors is that shortening the school week can potentially create new opportunities: first by opening up a “tutoring day” on Monday or Friday, and second through increased demand for services in areas where schools are hiring tutors. As always, those who can adapt their offerings to the changing needs of students and their families will be positioned to make the most of the situation. Featured photo courtesy of Jean Valley.

Could a four-day school week help solve these problems? Colorado School District 27J made national news when it officially cut Mondays from its school schedule in August 2018. District 27J receives one of the lowest levels of funding in the Denver metropolitan area and struggles to retain teachers as a result. But since switching to the new schedule, the district has enticed teachers from other districts to transfer to 27J. The transition also added US$1 million back into the district’s operating budget, part of which was spent on a Chromebook for every middle and high school student in the district. Though the new schedule met mixed reviews from parents and community members, studies show the shorter week significantly improves the health and happiness of students and teachers. - Colorado schools must meet a minimum quota of 1,080 hours of instruction each school year. - The average school day on a modified schedule lasts for seven and a half to eight hours, compared to the standard six-hour day. - School districts looking to switch to a schedule of less than 160 days must obtain approval from Colorado’s Commissioner of Education. - Not all schools within a district operate on the same schedule. - Schools on a four-day week schedule can save as much as 20 percent on transportation costs and food service programmes. 4-DAY SCHOOL WEEK: Do you think school districts in Southern California should do this? https:\/\/t.co\/CFZboAUyeA\n— ABC7 Eyewitness News (@ABC7) 16 May 2019\nA brief history of Colorado’s four-day school week\nIn Colorado, four-day weeks and schedules shorter than 160 days aren’t new. In fact, some Colorado schools have operated on a shorter schedule since the 1980-1981 academic school year. In 1980, a state law was passed that allowed school districts to operate on alternative schedules. That same academic year, three school districts moved to a four-day school week. The following academic year, 12 school districts made the switch. Unsurprisingly, for many school districts, cutting costs was the main reason behind the switch. The state’s information manual acknowledges that some schools cut a day from the school week due to the 2008 energy crisis. Spreading like wildfire\nAs of the 2019-2020 school year, 109 school districts in Colorado, which account for over 60 percent of the state’s school districts, have switched to a shorter schedule. Just one year after District J27 adopted the new schedule, five additional school districts applied to switch. The state department of education’s official manual on the four-day school week reports that this new schedule is immensely popular among students and teachers. Between 80 and 90 percent of community members prefer the four-day school week for many reasons, including more time to spend with family, more time to plan lessons, and increased teacher recruitment and retention rates. Recent studies on the four-day school week found that a shorter school week also improves student performance. One study found that more fourth- and fifth-grade students in rural districts operating on a four-day week scored at the proficient or advanced level in mathematics and reading tests:\n“These positive effects…suggest there is little evidence that switching to a four-day week harms student performance,” the study concludes. Consider the students\nStudents all around the world are feeling the pressure to do well in school. In England, 65 percent of students aged 12 to 16 list school as their primary source of stress, compared to 83 percent of students aged 16 and older. In Australia, 26 percent of kids report school is one of the main sources of their anxiety. In America, students as young as eight years old worry about making good grades and getting into college. School is taking its toll on their lives outside of the classroom, too. Nearly half of American students experience difficulty sleeping, with one in three children experiencing regular headaches. Cutting a day from the school week would give students more time to play, bond with their family and engage in extracurricular activities, including sports, volunteering and working. Consider the parents\nNot all parents are thrilled about the change, however – especially those who work on Mondays. To accommodate parents’ need for childcare services and relieve some of the financial burden, daily childcare services provided by District J27 have accompanied the new school week. This service currently costs US$30 per day, but a scholarship is available for low-income families which covers the cost.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:55f6c900-9897-45b9-9527-40ffb826db95>"]},{"passage":"Alternative Start Times for Schools\nIn the U.S., school calendar reform is gaining popularity with more schools experimenting with year round calendars, four-day school weeks, balanced calendars and later start times in an attempt to increase student achievement, cut costs, or improve the overall educational environment for teachers and students. Alternative start times are also in consideration in middle and high schools where teenage students need more sleep than younger students. While more instructional time cannot guarantee improved student achievement, many schools are finding beneficial results by implementing longer school days or longer school years. Many schools use extended learning time to increase the time available for core subject areas by either adding electives or credit recovery programs, making core subject classes longer, adding hours to the school day and even holding periodic Saturday classes. Extended school options can help students advance toward their post-secondary plans because they are allowed more time to earn college credit and gain internship or work experiences. A study on extended time in schools conducted by Massachusetts 2020 in 2005 looked at high performing high schools in Massachusetts and found that of the top performing schools, 50 percent have a school calendar longer than 180 days, and 80 percent have a school week longer than 32.5 hours. It seems that more time in school -- with either more hours in the day or more days of the year -- is positively linked to increased student achievement. Later Start Times\nThe impact of start times is greater for older students. Evidence links school start times to academic performance, and most studies have found later start times can improve student achievement. Assistant Professor of Economics at Colby College Finley Edwards published his study of start times' effect on middle school students in an article \"Do Schools Begin Too Early?\" The study was conducted in Wake County, North Carolina, as researchers examined how start times affected the performance of students on standardized tests. The results showed that by delaying start times by one hour, students experienced an increase of at least 2 percentage points in math and 1 percentage point in reading. Hormonal changes and increased need for more hours of sleep affect students' performance, so many educational experts feel that later start times would allow students to get more sleep and be more productive throughout the school day. Schools on four-day schedules attend the same amount of days in the year as traditional schedules but have longer school days, attending for an average of eight hours over the traditional 6.5 hours. Benefits to this schedule include increased student and teacher morale, reduced cost in transportation, and additional time for remediation. Drawbacks include childcare concerns and burnout over the course of longer school days. Year Round and Balanced Calendars\nYear-round calendars typically follow the start and end times of traditional schedules, but instead of a three month summer break, there are increments of breaks worked into the school year. Most schools follow a 45 days on\/15 days off schedule. A balanced calendar schedule reduces the length of the summer break by reapportioning those days throughout the school year. This means more frequent breaks with shorter periods of in-session days. The balanced and year-round calendar still follow the traditional 180 days of instruction, but instead of longer periods of in-session days and longer periods of vacation days, these times are balanced throughout the year to avoid long periods of either in-session or vacation days. These calendars can work, but the problem is that U.S. students are falling behind in global competition with other students. Multiple factors contribute to the falling behind of American students, but reforming the traditional American school calendar and start times could be the answer. - Photos.com\/Photos.com\/Getty Images","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:646620f1-abe8-4855-a8a4-4f7a9e18407c>"]},{"passage":"You get just as many days off at a year-round school as you would at a traditional school, just at a year-round school, it’s spreaded out through the year rather than all in one big break (The Pros and Cons of Year-Round School).

It would be easier for them to pick up where they left\nAttending school on a year-round calendar or a traditional calendar is a huge debate in the school districts across the United States. It is mainly about which calendar is best for the students’ academics. Everyone is talking about whether to keep the traditional school calendar or switch to year-round school. Year-round schooling is moving away from the traditional three semesters with a long summer break to shorter semesters with more, but shorter holidays. Since this is an ongoing debate, there are both pros and cons of having a change happen. Across the United States lies 37,100 high schools; each school comes in their own shapes and sizes. Educators recently looked into whether or not lowering school size could help better these students. Results found that small high schools contain less violence incidents. Moreover, small high schools result in a wider array of student involvement. Nonetheless, small high schools offer only a limited amount of courses and extracurriculars that students can get involved in.

In less than ten years, one third of students attending public schools will not know English when starting Kindergarten. Are schools and teachers ready for this and will push for bilingual instruction? Is America ready for this? As for now, there is mixed perspectives. schools are experimenting with innovative ways to adapt, including switching to a four-day school week. As many as 100 school districts have implemented a four-day week, especially in Colorado where over one-third of their school districts have adopted this schedule. While you probably aren 't likely to hear students complain about having a three-day weekend every weekend, this potentially offers a lot of advantages: removing a day means spending 20 percent less on things like busing, food, and utilities--in theory. Reports have found actual savings to end up being somewhat paltry, ranging from 0.4 to 2.5 percent per year. Now on, Some critics are concerned that students may not remember the lessons from last week because of the longer weekend and negatively impact students attention during classes. The grades on the report cards in the United States are A-F’s. The A’s on the report card are the best, and it is telling the teacher, you passed that class, but the F’s means you failed. Many of the schools in the United States do not give out E’s as\n(“Year-round education: Is summer vacation over... forever?”).

ELENA SILVA, SENIOR POLICY ANALYST, EDUCATION SECTOR: It's particularly true for low income kids who don't have the opportunities that other kids have during those big breaks. BOLDUAN: But more time is no silver bullet for reform. Miami-Dade County Schools in Florida used an extended day program for three years, but dropped it because they didn't see improvement in test scores. Critics say it disrupts family life and is expensive. The Miami-Dade program cost more than $100 million. MARTA PEREZ, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD: The teachers were fatigued at the end of the day. The students were fatigued and unmotivated. BOLDUAN: Which is another criticism: It's not just time, but the quality of the extra time that matters. SILVA: One of the risks, of course, is that you end up extending time in school that aren't working well and that's, I think goes without saying that no one wants to extend bad time. (END VIDEO CLIP)\nFour-Day School Week\nAZUZ: So, year-round school is one idea. What about the opposite: less time in school? That's what a lot of districts are doing, canceling one day of classes and moving to a four-day school week. The reason behind this? Money. For example, schools in Georgia's Peach County needed to cut $800,000. Switching to a four-day week will save about half of that. Less school might sound great to you, but not to everyone. It means parents will have to figure out where their kids will go on the day they're not in school. And remember in that last report, the idea of learning loss when you're not in class? It's the same concern around the four-day week. Before We Go\nAZUZ: Well, finally today, we'd like you to unleash your inner-geek. This is something we should all be concerned about: alien invasion! It happened in Atlanta this weekend when DragonCon rolled into town and brought some creative costumes with it. The sci-fi and comic convention always has an interesting cast of characters: Interplanetary predators? Yep. Old-school robots? Uh-huh. People willing to paint their face blue for no apparent reason? Got that too. Even a Sith lord couldn't stay away! AZUZ: We had some ideas for Darth Vader puns, but we didn't want to force anything. Wookie here, we've reached the end of today's show. We will be back again tomorrow. We'll see you then. |Most Viewed||Most Emailed||Top Searches|","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:cb887405-f964-404f-87c1-c899222683ee>"]},{"passage":"The purpose of this qualitative, case study was to understand how the four-day school week influenced a school district in Northern Arizona, over five years. Research Questions 1 through 3 addressed district performance including teacher\/staff and student attendance, achievement on the state assessment in reading and math, and costs on utilities. Research Question 4 addressed stakeholder perception. Maslow’s hierarchy of needs theory and collective impact theory served as the foundation for this study. The purposive sample included 40 internal and external stakeholders. Data collected included archival documents, semistructured interviews, and a structured questionnaire. A quantitative trend analysis was conducted on archival documents. Qualitative thematic analysis was conducted on interview perception data and structured questionnaire data was recoded for frequency. Archival data revealed natural gas costs decreased, student attendance improved, teacher\/staff attendance declined, math scores dropped, reading scores were flat, and water\/electricity costs increased. Perception data revealed stakeholders felt a positive impact on student attendance; saving money on utilities; teacher PD time; part-time employment; family time; and morale and staff retention. Stakeholders felt negatively towards teacher collaboration time; student achievement; the longer school day; lack of structure, supervision, and nutritious meals on the off day; and the Monday federal holidays causing school to be in session only three days per week. Overall, data revealed that while perceptions varied, stakeholders preferred the four-day regardless of any negative impacts to the district. The implications for this study are a resource and lessons learned for district personnel seeking to eliminate a day of instruction for the purposes of saving money. |Commitee:||Griffith, Nathan, McNulty, Charles|\n|School:||Grand Canyon University|\n|School Location:||United States -- Arizona|\n|Source:||DAI-A 79\/08(E), Dissertation Abstracts International|\n|Subjects:||Educational leadership, Educational administration|\n|Keywords:||District performance, Four-day school week, Stakeholder perception|\nCopyright in each Dissertation and Thesis is retained by the author.

Keeping track of all of them can be a real pain, especially if you have to log in and out of each one every time you want to use it. Fortunately, there's a solution to this problem: API integrations. API integrations allow you to connect two or more applications so that they can share data and information with each other. This means that you can access all of your applications from one central location, and you don't have to remember multiple login credentials. There are a few things to keep in mind when setting up API integrations:\nMake sure that the applications you're connecting support API integration. Not all applications do, so it's important to check before you get started. You can usually tell if this is the case if they have an \"API\" link at the bottom of their homepage. Determine what kind of data you want to share between the applications. Some integrations only allow for basic data sharing, while others allow for more complex interaction. Determine how the applications will share data. Will data be automatically synced between the applications, or will you need to manually transfer data? Set up a secure connection between the applications. This is important to prevent unauthorized access to your data. Once you've considered these factors, you're ready to start setting up API integrations. There are a few different ways to do this, so we'll outline a few of the most popular methods. One of the most popular methods for setting up API integrations is using a service like Zapier or IFTTT. These services allow you to connect a wide variety of applications and services, and they make it easy to automate tasks between them. For example, you could use Zapier to automatically add new contacts from your CRM to your email marketing list. Another popular method for setting up API integrations is through custom development. This is typically more complex than using a service like Zapier or IFTTT, but it gives you more control over the integration. If you're not a developer, you can hire someone to develop the integration for you. Once you've set up your API integration, it's important to test it to make sure everything is working as expected. You don't want to wait until you need to use the integration to find out that there are problems. API integrations can simplify your life by allowing you to connect all of your favorite applications and services in one place. By taking the time to set up an integration, you can save yourself a lot of time and frustration in the long run.\n\nThis is a third-party integration built by Welcome to the Jungle.

Things To Consider When Taking Your Dog To A Pet Friendly Restaurant\nTaking your dog to dog friendly restaurants can be a fun experience if you take the right precautions beforehand. Make sure you keep your leashed dog near you at all times and you only take well behaved dogs with you, as this makes for a dog friendly atmosphere that will make your and other guests’ trips enjoyable. Not everyone is a dog lover, so be conscious of that when taking your pet to local restaurants. Consider bringing something for your dog to do, such as a chew toy or dog treats, so they have something familiar from home. It’s also important to bring water and dog bags to pick up any messes in order to maintain an enjoyable environment for everyone. With these simple items in mind, you’ll be ready for a fun day out with your pup! A pet friendly restaurant can make dining out with your furry friend much more enjoyable.\n\nDo you hate leaving your precious pooch behind when you go out for lunch? There are several places in town that let you bring Fido, as long as he’s leashed and friendly. Here are some of the best pet-friendly restaurants near Springs Apartments. Called the \"best place to bring your puppy for a sweet treat,\" Snookies is a locally owned sweet shop and an area tradition. Take time for a visit to this quaint shop brimming with old-fashioned charm and get a cone for both you and your furry friend. Snookies regularly shares photos of happy dogs enjoying their puppy cones on its Facebook page. This deli prides itself on serving meals made from fresh, natural ingredients. They also take care to offer sandwiches and other menu items that are vegetarian and gluten-free. Your dog can join you at the outside dining area while you enjoy a Caprese Panini with fresh basil and tomato or the New Orleans Muffaletta. This nationwide sandwich shop lets your four-legged friend join you at its outside tables. There is also free Wi-Fi available, so you can munch away, check your Facebook feed and scratch your dog's ears all at the same time. Just don't fall for those sad, brown eyes begging you to share your broccoli and cheddar soup in a bread bowl. For great Mexican grub with dog-friendly outside dining, Chipotle at the Valley Mall should be your destination. Let Fido settle in for a nap under the table on the patio while you dig into one of Chipotle's fantastic burritos stuffed full of fresh ingredients. So, when lunchtime rolls around, you don't have to close the door on your dog's sad face. Grab the leash and take her with you to one of these fun places that loves dogs almost as much as you do.\n\nMankind’s infatuation with canine companionship is nothing new. In fact, it was unabashed dog lover King Frederick of Prussia that first coined the phrase “man’s best friend” back in 1789. These three small words have since described a millenia-long bond between man and dog; a bond that has become increasingly strong with the passing of time. For modern-day dog owners, “man’s best friend” is a comrade to be included in every aspect of life. We buy fashionable outfits for our pups. We create social media accounts for our furry friends, proudly sharing images of our pets just as first-time parents would. And now, dog lovers can rejoice over the emergence of drinking establishments that are not only dog-friendly, but dog-centric. In this pup-friendly bar trend Neptune Beach’s own BrewHound Dog Park + Bar and Riverside’s Kanine Social are leading the pack. Just weeks ago, Lauren Wyckoff and Jason Underwood opened the doors (gates?) of BrewHound Dog Park + Bar. “We were visiting Orlando and got to thinking, if you can bring your kid to a waterpark and have a drink, why can’t you go somewhere to have a beer with your dog?” reasons Wyckoff. “At the time, we hadn’t heard of anywhere where you could do that.”\nThe duo then set out to create a community-driven space filled with pups and local libations. “Our main goal was to get people together enjoying something outdoors so that they can have a greater appreciation of the environment,” says Wyckoff, who, along with Underwood is a self-proclaimed outdoor enthusiast. “When people visit the park, they’re engaging and meeting with people, which is what it’s all about.”\nFeaturing lots of rustic decor, BrewHound offers its two-legged customers a rotating variety of local craft beers, wine on tap, and Bold Bean specialty coffee. Owners can sip and stroll with their furry friends in “The Yard,” BrewHound’s off-leash dog park with daily, monthly, and annual memberships available. If you’re a dog-lover in search of a brew closer to downtown, College Street’s Kanine Social welcomes pups and owners alike to sit and stay for a cool beverage. Owners Daniel Moffatt and Dustin Fries opened Kanine in 2017, becoming Jax’s first boutique doggie daycare and private dog park to pair with a craft beer and coffee bar. “We first talked about the idea of opening a dog park and bar four or five years ago,” Moffatt explains. “We were always looking for a place where we could bring our dogs, enjoy a beer and watch a football game.”\nKanine’s taproom is open to the public, serving up beer on tap, wine, and ciders, while patron’s pups can avail themselves of some off-leash exercise. These amenities are paired with Kanine Social’s dog daycare. “Our concept allows them [patrons] the freedom to let their dogs run and play,” says Moffatt. “While enjoying a beer and having time to meet up with old friends or make new friends.”\nThough Kanine Social hasn’t been open to the public for quite a year yet, Moffatt and Fries have their eyes set toward opening a second location in the next 18-24 months.\n\nPet-Centric Establishments Gaining Popularity Around The World\nGood news for foodies with pets, more and more animal-friendly establishments are opening across the U.S. From kitty teahouses to dog park bars, it seems drinking and dining with pets is the new trend for 2014. KitTea, San Francisco\nA new feline-concept teahouse is being planned for San Francisco by business partners Courtney Hatt and David Barginsky. The cat coffeeshop is still in the planning stages but hopes to create an atmosphere for cat lovers to come and enjoy an afternoon tea while in the company of kitties. In order to keep up with health code regulations, there will likely be separate spaces for food sales and kitty lounging. However, guests will be allowed, and encouraged, to take their food purchases into the cat zone. Hatt and Barginsky hope to even partner with local pet stores or rescue organizations to allow guests to take home animals with whom they felt they had a special connection. The Boneyard in Houston is a bar and dog park all in one. Unlike KitTea, where the animals will live in-house, Boneyard has a strict bring-your-own-dog policy. Patrons are encouraged to bring their furry friends to play in the more than 7,000 square feet of park space. Meanwhile, dog owners can enjoy a drink from the bar’s extensive beer and wine list. Pets Deli, Berlin\nThe Pets Deli in Berlin is a one-of-a-kind food market serving up gourmet pet food to animals with discerning taste. The menu at Pet Deli is split into Meat, Vegetables and Carbs, offering animal friends a complete and balanced nutritional meal. The good people at Pets Deli even offer desserts for those pets on their “cheat day.” All offerings are approved by an on-staff animal nutritionist and can be served in a metal bowl to stay or ordered to-go in a plastic box.\n\nEating out with your pup can be a fun experience, but not all restaurants are dog friendly. Not all dogs are restaurant friendly. With that said, there are plenty of places that welcome dogs with open arms! Here’s a guide to the best dog-friendly restaurants in your city. Types of Dog Friendly Restaurants\nThe type of dog friendly restaurant you choose will depend on the type of atmosphere you’re looking for. For those who prefer an outdoor setting, consider an eatery with a patio or deck. These locations usually have plenty of room for Fido to roam around and will often provide water bowls or treats for your pup. If you’re looking for something more formal, look for a restaurant with pet-friendly seating inside. Some places even offer special menu items specifically designed for dogs! Anytime you offer a dog anything other than raw meat, make sure you do your research to ensure the food is safe for your furry friend. Things to Consider When Choosing a Dog Friendly Restaurant\nWhen choosing a restaurant to take your pup, there are several things to keep in mind. First and foremost is safety—make sure you choose an establishment that takes safety precautions seriously, such as providing non-slip flooring or keeping food away from Fido’s reach. You should also keep an eye out for any regulations that may be in place—some cities have ordinances against pets in food establishments, so make sure you know the rules before you go! And lastly, don’t forget about comfort—you want both you and your pet to be comfortable throughout the meal. That could mean leaving the leash attached. If you’re looking for a place to take your pup for lunch or dinner, many restaurants have dog-friendly outdoor patios. These patios are typically well shaded and provide seating away from the hustle and bustle of the street. Most of these patios also offer water bowls so your pup can stay hydrated during their mealtime. Be sure to call ahead and check if the restaurant has any restrictions on bringing pets into their outdoor patio before heading out for a bite. Dog Friendly Cafes\nIf you’re looking for something more casual than a restaurant, then why not try out one of the many dog friendly cafes? Dog friendly cafes are generally smaller establishments that offer food items such as sandwiches, salads, coffee, and pastries. Many of these cafe locations are situated in areas with high foot traffic so it’s easy to take your pup along for some R&R after work or school. Additionally, many of these cafes have outdoor seating areas which are great for people watching with your pooch by your side! Dog Parks & Pet Stores\nAnother option is to visit one of the many local dog parks or pet stores in your area. Dog parks offer plenty of space for you and your pup to get some exercise while pet stores usually have designated areas where pets are allowed inside. While at either location make sure you bring extra treats so you can reward Fido after a fun day out! Researching Restaurants Ahead of Time\nMost pet-friendly restaurants will have information about their policies listed on their websites or social media accounts. This makes researching ahead of time easy and convenient — simply search for “dog friendly restaurants near me” online and browse through the results. You should be able to find all the information you need before visiting a restaurant in person (such as whether they require pooches to be leashed or not). If there isn’t any info available online, then don’t hesitate to call the restaurant and ask directly. Checking Restaurant Reviews\nOnce you’ve identified a few potential places to take your pup, take the time to read some customer reviews — especially those written by dog owners who have taken their pets there before. By doing so, you can get a better sense of which restaurants are most accommodating towards canine guests, as well as which ones might be worth avoiding altogether. Customer reviews can also provide helpful tips such as where the best seating areas are located (e.g., outside patios), or which items on the menu are particularly popular among doggy diners. Ask Other Dog Owners for Recommendations\nIf you know other dog owners in your area who often bring their pets out when eating out, don’t hesitate to ask them for recommendations or advice. They may know of some hidden gems that aren’t always listed on Yelp or Google Maps! More importantly, they can share first-hand stories about their own experiences at certain establishments, especially the doggy menu — something that no amount of research can replace.\n\nPublished Jun 21, 2017\nWhether its your morning fix, an afternoon jolt or a late-night study session, what is your coffee shop? \"Super friendly service, excellent food and beverages.

You can happily scroll through their Instagram to find the best doggos gracing your screen—and with hammocks and a great space, it’s no wonder dog owners love to bring their dogs there. This is also the perfect opportunity for you to snap a picture of your own pet and claim bragging rights on your own social media. photo via @hisignbrewing\nThe outdoor patio greets humans and pets alike. If you’re more into enjoying some food with your beer, Via 313 Pizza will serve as a great choice for you. Not only can pups help you with the pizza, but they can hang out with you outside—preferably once the sun starts to set in this heated summer. This venue is also going to have the most options for you to try, so good luck picking one! photo via @via313\nDon’t worry, DFW friends, we’ve got some places for you, too. Designed with a huge open floor plan, you can easily enjoy a brew in this dog-friendly taproom. There’s plenty of shade, so an afternoon trip won’t be terrible. Celebrate the day with a Sip-N-Go Pils or the Soul Pleasure stout. If you’re craving a view of downtown Ft. Worth, then this is the taproom for you. A view, your pups and a cold, lovingly-crafted beer—do you need anything else? Bring your pup out and enjoy the appropriate brew, Sweet Fang. photo via @pantherislandbrewing\nOne can never do wrong with a good can design. Admire the can you’re drinking from while you and your pups sit in an eclectic taproom in Dallas. An appropriate beer for the occasion? Off the Leash, a red ale that’s a solid six percent ABV. Since the venue does serve food, pets must be strictly confined to the patio. That doesn’t make them any less dog-friendly, though. Set up shop and relax while you celebrate the best day ever with your best friend. Just north of Dallas, in Farmer’s Branch, Texas, lies 3 Nations Brewing, a community taproom that loves having your dog around. Another great thing about them? PintHub and 3 Nations Brewing have over 10 beers for you to try at their location. Overwhelming? Try their American Wit or the Stone Wizard Double IPA. photo via @3nationsbrewing\nWhichever venue you choose, celebrate National Dog Day with your furry best friend with your “on the house” beer. Open up your PintHub app and start drinking!\n\nDogs are welcome, at least under certain circumstances, in more places with each passing year. A number of parks, schools, hotels and hospitals now allow dogs, and a wide variety of businesses let both employees and customers bring their dogs with them. There are still a lot of places that are off limits to our four-legged family members, and this continues to affect most people with dogs. I was recently at a local bookstore that allows dogs, but the café inside the store is for people only. There is a very nice sign saying that health codes prohibit them from welcoming dogs to the café, though they are welcome in the rest of the store. The staff works very hard to accommodate people who have brought their dog to the bookstore and would like a cup of coffee by bringing their orders out of the café and into the main part of the bookstore. I’m sure many dog guardians skip the café because they can’t sit down and enjoy a drink if accompanied by a dog. However, many people do request “delivery” to the main part of the store, and seem appreciative of the option. Years ago I worked with a woman who would hardly go anywhere without her dog. She brought him to work, which was allowed as we worked at a facility that provided dog training, dog grooming and dog day care. This woman never went to the movies because her dog was not allowed to go with her, and never ate in restaurants for the same reason. She made some concessions to practicality such as going to the grocery store or on other errands alone, but she generally only went where her dog was allowed to come, too. She made decisions that many could consider extreme, but they certainly worked for her and for her dog. Her social life was affected by her unwillingness to go places without her dog, but she has always been very happy with her choices and has a good life. Are there any places you don’t go because of restrictions that prevent your dog from coming, too?\n\nWelcome to this week’s installment of Ask the Critics. If you have a question you’d like answered in a future column, email us or leave the query in the comments. Today, we deal with a question that always comes up with the advent of warm weather:\nWhich restaurants will allow me to bring my dog? Technically, dogs aren’t allowed at restaurants, but some places will let you park Fluffy at your table in an outdoor seating section. Eateries with an enclosure around their sidewalk seating are likely to ask you to hitch your dog outside the railing, and then will seat you right next to it. Plus, some bars welcome dogs inside. At Pastis, your dog is welcome to sit outside the sidewalk barricade, and staff will bring a bowl of water if you ask. Similarly, Toby’s Public House, the excellent wood-oven pizza spot in Greenwood Heights, has a deck where your dog can sit right next to you, though outside the railing. The staff are very friendly about it, and will also bring water for the dog. Dog-friendly outdoor seating areas without enclosures are harder to find because, technically, they’re against code. Tabla is more hospitable than most, allowing pooches to sit with their owners in the outdoor cafe that overlooks Madison Square Park. And Pao, the comfortable Portuguese spot in the West Village, will let canines sit with you at the sidewalk tables. For a glass of wine in a relaxed atmosphere, check out Von, which welcomes dogs inside. For a big-ass cocktail at a fair price, head to Brooklyn’s Quarter Bar. If you get tipsy, your dog can walk you home. The dog-friendliness of these venues has all been recently verified, but it’s always a good idea to call before you go. You never know when a grouchy manager might be on duty. If you know of other good, dog-friendly eateries, let us know in the comments.\n\nWhether your new pup suffers from separation anxiety or you’d simply rather enjoy a meal with your best friend by your side, sometimes bringing your dog along to your dinner date sounds much more relaxing than leaving him or her at home. And while you won’t find too many dog-friendly spots in Billings, there are definitely a few that would be more than happy to welcome your well-behaved canine companion. You can sit on the patio with your dog at The Rex, which is located in the heart of the historic district at 2401 Montana Ave. This local historic landmark, which has been around since 1910, is a fun place to hang out and enjoy a steak and a beer. And it’s even more fun with a dog by your side. Bin 119 is a quiet bistro and wine bar on North Broadway with a small patio that will accommodate your leashed dog as long as he stays close to you. You’ll love the wine list and the ambiance, and your pup will likely be a big fan of Monday night Steak Night. The Windmill Restaurant at 3429 TransTech Way is a Billings classic, and they do allow dogs on their outdoor patio — but only during the day, and only when they aren’t too busy. The restaurant has a great kids’ menu, too, so if you go at the right time, you can feed the entire family. We can’t speak for every location, but the Fuddruckers at 2011 Overland Ave. allows leashed, well-mannered dogs to hang out at their outdoor seating area. But good luck trying to get away with not buying your pup a burger.","passages":[{"passage":"Dog Friendly Restaurant Chains\nWith the increasing number of dog-friendly restaurant chains, you can enjoy a great meal with your furry family member.

Things To Consider When Taking Your Dog To A Pet Friendly Restaurant\nTaking your dog to dog friendly restaurants can be a fun experience if you take the right precautions beforehand. Make sure you keep your leashed dog near you at all times and you only take well behaved dogs with you, as this makes for a dog friendly atmosphere that will make your and other guests’ trips enjoyable. Not everyone is a dog lover, so be conscious of that when taking your pet to local restaurants. Consider bringing something for your dog to do, such as a chew toy or dog treats, so they have something familiar from home. It’s also important to bring water and dog bags to pick up any messes in order to maintain an enjoyable environment for everyone. With these simple items in mind, you’ll be ready for a fun day out with your pup! A pet friendly restaurant can make dining out with your furry friend much more enjoyable.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:6acc9498-93c7-4e61-9aac-d0c7b68ab4f0>"]},{"passage":"Do you hate leaving your precious pooch behind when you go out for lunch? There are several places in town that let you bring Fido, as long as he’s leashed and friendly. Here are some of the best pet-friendly restaurants near Springs Apartments. Called the \"best place to bring your puppy for a sweet treat,\" Snookies is a locally owned sweet shop and an area tradition. Take time for a visit to this quaint shop brimming with old-fashioned charm and get a cone for both you and your furry friend. Snookies regularly shares photos of happy dogs enjoying their puppy cones on its Facebook page. This deli prides itself on serving meals made from fresh, natural ingredients.

In fact, it was unabashed dog lover King Frederick of Prussia that first coined the phrase “man’s best friend” back in 1789. These three small words have since described a millenia-long bond between man and dog; a bond that has become increasingly strong with the passing of time. For modern-day dog owners, “man’s best friend” is a comrade to be included in every aspect of life. We buy fashionable outfits for our pups. We create social media accounts for our furry friends, proudly sharing images of our pets just as first-time parents would. And now, dog lovers can rejoice over the emergence of drinking establishments that are not only dog-friendly, but dog-centric. In this pup-friendly bar trend Neptune Beach’s own BrewHound Dog Park + Bar and Riverside’s Kanine Social are leading the pack. Just weeks ago, Lauren Wyckoff and Jason Underwood opened the doors (gates?) of BrewHound Dog Park + Bar. “We were visiting Orlando and got to thinking, if you can bring your kid to a waterpark and have a drink, why can’t you go somewhere to have a beer with your dog?” reasons Wyckoff. “At the time, we hadn’t heard of anywhere where you could do that.”\nThe duo then set out to create a community-driven space filled with pups and local libations. “Our main goal was to get people together enjoying something outdoors so that they can have a greater appreciation of the environment,” says Wyckoff, who, along with Underwood is a self-proclaimed outdoor enthusiast. “When people visit the park, they’re engaging and meeting with people, which is what it’s all about.”\nFeaturing lots of rustic decor, BrewHound offers its two-legged customers a rotating variety of local craft beers, wine on tap, and Bold Bean specialty coffee. Owners can sip and stroll with their furry friends in “The Yard,” BrewHound’s off-leash dog park with daily, monthly, and annual memberships available. If you’re a dog-lover in search of a brew closer to downtown, College Street’s Kanine Social welcomes pups and owners alike to sit and stay for a cool beverage. Owners Daniel Moffatt and Dustin Fries opened Kanine in 2017, becoming Jax’s first boutique doggie daycare and private dog park to pair with a craft beer and coffee bar. “We first talked about the idea of opening a dog park and bar four or five years ago,” Moffatt explains. “We were always looking for a place where we could bring our dogs, enjoy a beer and watch a football game.”\nKanine’s taproom is open to the public, serving up beer on tap, wine, and ciders, while patron’s pups can avail themselves of some off-leash exercise. These amenities are paired with Kanine Social’s dog daycare. “Our concept allows them [patrons] the freedom to let their dogs run and play,” says Moffatt. “While enjoying a beer and having time to meet up with old friends or make new friends.”\nThough Kanine Social hasn’t been open to the public for quite a year yet, Moffatt and Fries have their eyes set toward opening a second location in the next 18-24 months.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:80965d7e-3492-4c8e-8ef7-ba5d0304e7e0>"]},{"passage":"Pet-Centric Establishments Gaining Popularity Around The World\nGood news for foodies with pets, more and more animal-friendly establishments are opening across the U.S. From kitty teahouses to dog park bars, it seems drinking and dining with pets is the new trend for 2014. KitTea, San Francisco\nA new feline-concept teahouse is being planned for San Francisco by business partners Courtney Hatt and David Barginsky. The cat coffeeshop is still in the planning stages but hopes to create an atmosphere for cat lovers to come and enjoy an afternoon tea while in the company of kitties. In order to keep up with health code regulations, there will likely be separate spaces for food sales and kitty lounging. However, guests will be allowed, and encouraged, to take their food purchases into the cat zone. Hatt and Barginsky hope to even partner with local pet stores or rescue organizations to allow guests to take home animals with whom they felt they had a special connection. The Boneyard in Houston is a bar and dog park all in one. Unlike KitTea, where the animals will live in-house, Boneyard has a strict bring-your-own-dog policy. Patrons are encouraged to bring their furry friends to play in the more than 7,000 square feet of park space. Meanwhile, dog owners can enjoy a drink from the bar’s extensive beer and wine list. Pets Deli, Berlin\nThe Pets Deli in Berlin is a one-of-a-kind food market serving up gourmet pet food to animals with discerning taste. The menu at Pet Deli is split into Meat, Vegetables and Carbs, offering animal friends a complete and balanced nutritional meal. The good people at Pets Deli even offer desserts for those pets on their “cheat day.” All offerings are approved by an on-staff animal nutritionist and can be served in a metal bowl to stay or ordered to-go in a plastic box.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:90319bbf-8172-42b7-9406-61a93472995f>"]},{"passage":"Eating out with your pup can be a fun experience, but not all restaurants are dog friendly. Not all dogs are restaurant friendly. With that said, there are plenty of places that welcome dogs with open arms! Here’s a guide to the best dog-friendly restaurants in your city. Types of Dog Friendly Restaurants\nThe type of dog friendly restaurant you choose will depend on the type of atmosphere you’re looking for. For those who prefer an outdoor setting, consider an eatery with a patio or deck. These locations usually have plenty of room for Fido to roam around and will often provide water bowls or treats for your pup. If you’re looking for something more formal, look for a restaurant with pet-friendly seating inside. Some places even offer special menu items specifically designed for dogs! Anytime you offer a dog anything other than raw meat, make sure you do your research to ensure the food is safe for your furry friend. Things to Consider When Choosing a Dog Friendly Restaurant\nWhen choosing a restaurant to take your pup, there are several things to keep in mind. First and foremost is safety—make sure you choose an establishment that takes safety precautions seriously, such as providing non-slip flooring or keeping food away from Fido’s reach. You should also keep an eye out for any regulations that may be in place—some cities have ordinances against pets in food establishments, so make sure you know the rules before you go! And lastly, don’t forget about comfort—you want both you and your pet to be comfortable throughout the meal. That could mean leaving the leash attached. If you’re looking for a place to take your pup for lunch or dinner, many restaurants have dog-friendly outdoor patios. These patios are typically well shaded and provide seating away from the hustle and bustle of the street. Most of these patios also offer water bowls so your pup can stay hydrated during their mealtime. Be sure to call ahead and check if the restaurant has any restrictions on bringing pets into their outdoor patio before heading out for a bite. Dog Friendly Cafes\nIf you’re looking for something more casual than a restaurant, then why not try out one of the many dog friendly cafes? Dog friendly cafes are generally smaller establishments that offer food items such as sandwiches, salads, coffee, and pastries. Many of these cafe locations are situated in areas with high foot traffic so it’s easy to take your pup along for some R&R after work or school. Additionally, many of these cafes have outdoor seating areas which are great for people watching with your pooch by your side! Dog Parks & Pet Stores\nAnother option is to visit one of the many local dog parks or pet stores in your area. Dog parks offer plenty of space for you and your pup to get some exercise while pet stores usually have designated areas where pets are allowed inside. While at either location make sure you bring extra treats so you can reward Fido after a fun day out! Researching Restaurants Ahead of Time\nMost pet-friendly restaurants will have information about their policies listed on their websites or social media accounts. This makes researching ahead of time easy and convenient — simply search for “dog friendly restaurants near me” online and browse through the results. You should be able to find all the information you need before visiting a restaurant in person (such as whether they require pooches to be leashed or not). If there isn’t any info available online, then don’t hesitate to call the restaurant and ask directly. Checking Restaurant Reviews\nOnce you’ve identified a few potential places to take your pup, take the time to read some customer reviews — especially those written by dog owners who have taken their pets there before. By doing so, you can get a better sense of which restaurants are most accommodating towards canine guests, as well as which ones might be worth avoiding altogether. Customer reviews can also provide helpful tips such as where the best seating areas are located (e.g., outside patios), or which items on the menu are particularly popular among doggy diners. Ask Other Dog Owners for Recommendations\nIf you know other dog owners in your area who often bring their pets out when eating out, don’t hesitate to ask them for recommendations or advice. They may know of some hidden gems that aren’t always listed on Yelp or Google Maps! More importantly, they can share first-hand stories about their own experiences at certain establishments, especially the doggy menu — something that no amount of research can replace.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:6acc9498-93c7-4e61-9aac-d0c7b68ab4f0>"]},{"passage":"Published Jun 21, 2017\nWhether its your morning fix, an afternoon jolt or a late-night study session, what is your coffee shop? \"Super friendly service, excellent food and beverages.

Technically, dogs aren’t allowed at restaurants, but some places will let you park Fluffy at your table in an outdoor seating section. Eateries with an enclosure around their sidewalk seating are likely to ask you to hitch your dog outside the railing, and then will seat you right next to it. Plus, some bars welcome dogs inside. At Pastis, your dog is welcome to sit outside the sidewalk barricade, and staff will bring a bowl of water if you ask. Similarly, Toby’s Public House, the excellent wood-oven pizza spot in Greenwood Heights, has a deck where your dog can sit right next to you, though outside the railing. The staff are very friendly about it, and will also bring water for the dog. Dog-friendly outdoor seating areas without enclosures are harder to find because, technically, they’re against code. Tabla is more hospitable than most, allowing pooches to sit with their owners in the outdoor cafe that overlooks Madison Square Park. And Pao, the comfortable Portuguese spot in the West Village, will let canines sit with you at the sidewalk tables. For a glass of wine in a relaxed atmosphere, check out Von, which welcomes dogs inside. For a big-ass cocktail at a fair price, head to Brooklyn’s Quarter Bar. If you get tipsy, your dog can walk you home. The dog-friendliness of these venues has all been recently verified, but it’s always a good idea to call before you go. You never know when a grouchy manager might be on duty. If you know of other good, dog-friendly eateries, let us know in the comments.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:007bc13e-0ae5-4c02-8e84-59a830355557>"]},{"passage":"Whether your new pup suffers from separation anxiety or you’d simply rather enjoy a meal with your best friend by your side, sometimes bringing your dog along to your dinner date sounds much more relaxing than leaving him or her at home. And while you won’t find too many dog-friendly spots in Billings, there are definitely a few that would be more than happy to welcome your well-behaved canine companion. You can sit on the patio with your dog at The Rex, which is located in the heart of the historic district at 2401 Montana Ave. This local historic landmark, which has been around since 1910, is a fun place to hang out and enjoy a steak and a beer. And it’s even more fun with a dog by your side. Bin 119 is a quiet bistro and wine bar on North Broadway with a small patio that will accommodate your leashed dog as long as he stays close to you. You’ll love the wine list and the ambiance, and your pup will likely be a big fan of Monday night Steak Night. The Windmill Restaurant at 3429 TransTech Way is a Billings classic, and they do allow dogs on their outdoor patio — but only during the day, and only when they aren’t too busy. The restaurant has a great kids’ menu, too, so if you go at the right time, you can feed the entire family. We can’t speak for every location, but the Fuddruckers at 2011 Overland Ave. allows leashed, well-mannered dogs to hang out at their outdoor seating area. But good luck trying to get away with not buying your pup a burger.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:263be005-af90-49b0-a866-73f0d0751fba>"]}]}

Camping is one of my absolute favorite ways to spend a long weekend, but I know that for a lot of people, just the idea of spending a night or two outdoors sounds nothing short of horrendous – and, yes, without the proper precautions, it can be!\nBut the more you camp, the more you learn, and I thought it would be fun to share some of the tips and tricks I’ve learned (usually the hard way) to make your next camping trip the best one yet.\nAnd if something still goes wrong? Trust me when I say that some of my favorite camping memories are the ones where everything went to shit (like that time we ended up eating eggs at a Denny’s at midnight amid a torrential downpour that flooded the campground’s latrines…it’s funny now, though!).\nSo, without further ado, here are my camping essentials!\n1. Pack LAYERS.\nThere is nothing worse than being cold (and I lived in freakin’ Sweden for nearly ten years, so I know). Even if you think bringing that extra sweater or pair of leggings seems ridiculous, just do it. You’ll be so grateful later. I always do like my dear Mama, and wear a pair of long underwear when camping, as it is much easier to remove layers if you’re too hot. Also, sleeping bags may keep your body warm, but I always bring an extra pair of socks, gloves, and a hat to keep my extremities warm and toasty all night long. As we say in Sweden, there’s no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothes!\n2. Anticipate darkness.\nThis may sound totally obvious, but, out in nature, there is this concept of night, and, away from the modern luxury of electricity, night time is usually quite DARK. While this means you’ll get to see some incredible stars, I always, always, always seem to forget how hard it is to manage in pitch black darkness. Plan ahead and bring as many flashlights, torches, headlamps (the best), as you can because you will need them. One of my favorite camping hacks? Strap a headlamp onto a gallon jug of water or milk for an instant portable lamp.\n3. Pack sustainable food.\nWhen I say ‘sustainable’, I’m referring to food that will a) survive no or little refrigeration, b) be able to handle lots of movement, and c) still be appealing three days later. I always take a cooler when I camp, but, depending on the length of your trip, that may or may not ensure that all your food stays fresh the whole time. My favorite thing to do is to plan all of the meals ahead of time, and shop accordingly. Also, make sure to prep your food for easy cleanup\/cooking time. If you want eggs for breakfast, crack them into a ziplock bag for easy transportation along with any cheese, salt\/pepper\/veggies, etc., that you want to add. If you want to grill hamburgers for dinner, wash, chop, and separate all your ingredients ahead of time to avoid doing so at the campsite. My favorite foods to bring on a camping trip are make-ahead breakfast burritos, kettle corn, foil-wrapped dinners, hot dogs\/bratwursts, sandwich supplies (pb&j, ham and cheese, turkey, sprouts, mustard, etc.), and, of course, s’mores!\n4. Embrace the gross\nDepending on your level of comfort when it comes to roughing-it, camping usually means that you’ll be shower-less for the next few days. Instead of focusing on how gross that might be, just embrace it! It’s not like you have a job interview later that day or something (and if you do, reschedule immediately). Instead, focus on little ways to feel fresh sans shower, like brushing your teeth (totally doable with a bottle of water), changing your underwear daily (seriously, this makes a HUGE difference), and, if you have long hair, putting it up into an up-do of some kind (I usually go for french braids) to keep it off your face. In a few days’ time, you’ll be back in your lovely, warm shower, promise!\n5. Anticipate problems\nKnock on wood, you won’t need to break out your first-aid-kit or car jack, but I’m a firm believer in the idea that being unprepared is just asking for trouble. Always let someone know where you’re going (especially if going alone, which I do not recommend unless you’re a seasoned outdoors-person, and even then, remember this???). Make sure you always have:\n- Lots of water\n- Toilet paper\n- A good knife\n- A lighter or box of matches\n- First aid kit\n- A map and compass\n- Storm-proof outdoor gear\n- A way of contacting someone in case of emergency (phone, walkie-talkie, etc.)\n6. Bring some of the good stuff\nCamping is a bit of work, but that doesn’t mean that it shouldn’t be enjoyable! I always make sure to bring a good bottle of wine or flask of whiskey, a pack of playing cards, a frisbee or soccer ball, some comfortable lawn chairs, a hammock, a good book, and a portable radio for some of the quieter moments.\nAlways make sure to research where you’re going and what there is nearby before leaving for your trip. Your phone will most likely not work once there, so having some print outs of fun activities in the area can be great when you want to explore your surroundings. It’s also a good idea to know where the nearest store or town is in case of emergency (like running out of toilet paper!) or if you just absolutely need a ‘real’ cup of coffee in the morning.\nDo you have any good camping tips to share?

Here is a guide on how to stay hygienic while camping. You can use these items to clean yourself up, especially if your camping trip extends for days or even weeks. You will never have to worry about staying clean and hygienic. It is very important to keep yourself clean to prevent the onset of illnesses caused by the accumulated bacteria or microorganisms. This is a foldable basin that can serve as your sink. It is made of a cloth material that is waterproof so you can just fold this up into a smaller piece when not in use. You can use this as a makeshift sink for when you are washing your hands or face. This can also be used as a place to wash your dishes. This has handles at the sides so you can actually transform this into a bucket. This is a great invention because it allows you to enjoy hot showers even when you are in the wilderness. This is a shower bag with a solar panel which charges the water heater. You basically fill this bag with water and then hang it up on a tree or something elevated. The solar panel gathers solar energy and converts it into electricity that can heat up your water up to forty-five degrees Celsius. This has power settings so you can adjust the heat level according to your preference. You can now enjoy warm and comfortable showers even in the wild! If you want a simple shower bag, then go for this. This is like the aforementioned product minus the water heater feature. The bag is made of PVC material with great heat retention so it can warm up your water at least. You can fold this bag for transport and then simply unfold it whenever you want to use it. It can carry up to ten gallons of water inside. You can now enjoy a refreshing and relaxing bath anywhere. Here is an easy solution to attain some privacy outdoors. This is a tent that forms a bathroom stall. It has very sturdy poles that can hold it upright and it can withstand windy conditions. You can use this while you are taking a shower or doing other bathroom affairs. Purified water is a must for all of your cleaning needs. It would be impossible to lug around gallons of clean water throughout your trip. The best you can do is to bring a water purifier with you so that you can transform any water source into something you can use. This purifier has three filtration stages for effective cleaning and this can also eliminate various bacteria.\n\nAny number of short to long-term disasters could leave you without power and\/or running water. The result is a serious but difficult topic in prepping: hygiene. Without running water, using your toilet becomes problematic. And showering or bathing is no longer a daily routine that is taken for granted. Without power, you won’t have hot water from the water heater for washing pots, pans, dishes, glasses, or for washing hands. The ideal solution is to have a home with its own well, its own septic system, and a solar and\/or wind source of off-grid power. Then you will be all set. The next best solution is to move in with someone who has that type of home and resources. If these two solutions don’t work for you, read on. Suppose that you no longer have a source of running water or power. What are your options? Fortunately, the typical toilet plumbing does not require electricity. It works by the force of water and gravity. What you do need, to flush the toilet without running water, is plenty of water (a few gallons at least) for each flush. The water need not be drinkable (i.e. potable), but you need about 5 gallons per person per day for flushing (about 1 flush per person per day). Some more efficient toilets might flush with less water, but you are always better off with more water. What this means is that, in addition to your stored drinking water and some water purification equipment, you also need a source of non-drinkable (non-potable) water. You might collect some rainwater, using the rain spouts on your house. Be advised that collecting rain water is actually illegal in some localities. There are some commercial products that capture water from rain gutters and store it in a large barrel (about 50 gallons). One of these on each side of the house is 100 gallons, but only about 20 flushes. You could use water from a swimming pool. Or you might want to have a couple of very large water storage container, very large, kept outdoors for just such an eventuality. But the amount of water needed, say for a month or two without running water, gives you an idea of the scope of the problem. If this type of situation continues long term, you are going to need another approach, but I’m not sure what will work. You could set up an outhouse, or any type of outdoor latrine. There are few other options. Running water is difficult to replace as a part of modern comfortable living. If you are without food, you can grow your own food. If you are without drinking water, you can purify the gallon or so of water you need each day. But without running water, long-term, your options are all not very good. Bathing is another problem when you lack running water. The amount of water needed to shower or fill a bathtub to a shallow extent is at least 5 to 10 gallons. Washing with less water than that is undesirable. You also need water for washing your hands. You can use alcohol-based hand cleanser to a limited extent, to kill bacteria. Eventually, you need to actually wash off dirt and grime. So again the situation requires a substantial amount of water on a monthly basis, if some disaster deprives you of running water. An AquaPod Kit holds about 65 gallons of water in your bathtub (in a plastic bag, essentially). But then you tub is unavailable for use in bathing\/showering. Camping supply stores often have outdoor showering devices that use a limited amount of water, and which could conceivably be used indoors, when you lack running water. I’ll mention a couple of these devices, but I have not tested or evaluated any of them. Zodi Battery-Powered Shower — battery power means that you are not relying only on gravity to deliver a stream of water. Stearns Outdoor SunShower 6.0 — this type of shower is ‘heated’ by the sun striking the black bag of water, meaning that the water is at best warm, but not really hot. It takes 3 hours in the sun, at least, to warm the water. I’m omitting the more expensive devices, such as propane-powered showers with point-of-use water heating built-in. I’m skeptical that this type of device is worth the expense. Another issue raised by a lack of running water is cleaning dishes and cooking utensils. This type of hygiene problem can endanger your health.\n\nBecause the tent is one of the most essential aspects of your camping trip, be sure usually the one you will get is suitable. Figure out how so many people are coming in the trip so you can get a big enough tent. Also, be sure the tent you receive prevents moisture from getting inside. If you are searching for camping but they are unclear should it be a good choice for yourself, you may want to commence with something a little easier, like residing in a cabin or renting an RV for any weekend. If you like nature with this convenience, then it might be a chance to up the game to some tent. It's a smart idea to maintain hygiene when camping. Things like washcloths, sponges, bowls, biodegradable soaps, toothbrushes, toothpaste, baking soda, floss, and water that is clean can assist you stay clean in your trip. You may also use hand sanitizer, rubbing alcohol, and cotton balls on non-sensitive areas. Don't use anything with fragrances given that they can attract bugs.\n\nTable of Contents\nGood personal hygiene is one of the best ways to protect yourself from getting illnesses such as gastroenteritis and the common cold. Washing your hands with soap removes germs that can make you ill. Maintaining good personal hygiene will also help prevent you from spreading diseases to other people. What is personal hygiene? Personal hygiene includes:\n- cleaning your body every day\n- washing your hands with soap after going to the toilet\n- brushing your teeth twice a day\n- covering your mouth and nose with a tissue (or your sleeve) when sneezing or coughing\n- washing your hands after handling pets and other animals\nWhy is personal hygiene important? Good hygiene is vital because it helps prevent you and your children from getting or spreading germs and infectious diseases. The germs that cause many diseases can be passed on through touching other people, getting faeces (poo) on your hands, handling contaminated food and coming into contact with dirty surfaces or objects. Conditions that you can develop if you have poor personal hygiene include:\nWashing your body\nTry to bath or shower each day. Wash well, especially under your armpits and around your genitals and anus. Keeping clean will prevent skin irritations and remove bacteria that cause body odour. Wash yourself with soap, shower gel or a hypoallergenic body wash. Soap removes more germs, but you may need to wash sensitive body parts with plain water or salt water. If there is no tap water or it is scarce, clean yourself with a clean wet cloth or sponge. Washing your hands\nTo avoid getting sick, wash your hands properly. - Wet your hands, then wash with soap or with an alcohol-based hand sanitiser for at least 20 seconds. Lather between the fingers and the back of your hands. - Clean grubby nails with a scrubbing brush, if one is available. - Rinse both sides of your hands, preferably under clean running water. - Dry off your hands with a clean towel or let them dry in the air. When to wash your hands\nIt is especially important to wash your hands after going to the toilet because faeces, which you might come into contact with, contains billions of germs. Also, wash your hands:\n- before and after eating or preparing food\n- after changing babies’ nappies\n- before and after touching a sick person or cleaning up vomit or body fluids\n- after blowing your nose\n- before and after treating cuts or wounds\n- after touching rubbish, dirty surfaces or objects\n- after handling pets or farm animals\nFind out more here about hand washing. Washing your genitals\nMen who are uncircumcised can clean their penis by gently pulling back the foreskin and washing underneath it with warm water or soap. See more here about penis care. Women can gently wash the delicate skin around the vulva with a soap-free wash, salt water or plain water. Avoid perfumed soap and bath products since these may irritate the sensitive skin of the vulva. Do not douche, because it upsets the healthy good bacteria in your vagina. During menstruation (your periods), wash your vulva as usual. Tampons can be changed every 3 to 4 hours. To avoid toxic shock syndrome, do not leave a tampon in for more than 8 hours. Change sanitary pads several times a day. Wash your hands before and after changing tampons or pads. Preventing body odour\nAfter washing, apply deodorant to your armpits. Put on clean, dry clothing. Wash sweaty or dirty garments well and, if possible, hang them outdoors to dry. If you have a problem with excessive sweating, make an appointment to see your doctor. Handling food safely\nWash your hands before and after preparing food. This will stop you contaminating food and will also protect you from getting ill or passing on bacteria from foodstuffs, such as raw meat. Find out more here about food safety. Preventing bad breath\nBad breath can be caused by poor oral hygiene. Brush and floss your teeth twice a day since this reduces gum disease and the chances of future tooth decay. Use these dental care tips and make an appointment with a dentist for a check-up if you have further symptoms.\n\nWARWICK, England, October 13, 2015 \/PRNewswire\/ --\n- Personal hygiene takes a back seat to staying in bed once winter sets in\nA study of 2,000 adults undertaken by Geberit AquaClean revealed major differences in personal hygiene routines in the winter vs summer, with many Brits (33%) halving the amount of time they spend in the bathroom during the colder weather from 30 minutes to just 15. It's not just less time that is spent on personal hygiene in winter, but less money too. The average monthly spend on personal hygiene products in the UK is £29.57, but 18% of Brits reduce their spending during the winter. Part of the reason for this seasonal difference is that we get less hot and sweaty during the winter months (57% cited this), but many Brits admit that it's simply too cold to shower so frequently in winter. In fact , 34% of us admit to bathing or showering less frequently in the winter, with a quarter of adults preferring to spend more time in bed as the cold dark mornings leave us feeling more tired. Meanwhile 2\/3 of women shave less their legs less frequently in the winter and 56% stated that their feet are neglected in the colder months. Raffaela De Vittorio, Marketing Director for Geberit AquaClean, which conducted the study, said: \"During the winter months many of us would rather grab some extra time under a warm duvet than in the bathroom, which is where the latest shower toilet technology really comes into its own. Gently cleaning you with warm water after each use, the Geberit AquaClean ensures healthy personal hygiene levels are maintained whatever the weather.\" While 15% of Brits would consider installing a shower toilet, currently just 6% of the survey's respondents use one, with the most popular way of cleaning after using the toilet being with wet wipes (40%), followed by showering (19%). However, taking a shower can be time consuming, particularly when compared to using a shower toilet. Despite people taking less time to clean themselves during the winter months, a staggering 10% of adults admit that they don't change their underwear every day, with 1% even owning up to doing so less than once a week! \"The research shows that despite the average Brit spending less time in the bathroom during the winter, their desire to feel fresh and clean is just as strong as in the summer and with so many people admitting to not changing their underwear regularly, a shower toilet ensures that personal hygiene levels are maintained no matter what the season is,\" adds Raffaela.

Traditionally we are the primary caregivers in our families. We prepare food, care for the kids, and ensure the house is clean. In some cases, we are the breadwinner of the family too, having to handle our family responsibilities while working a job or two. Under these circumstances, we might not be able to pay full attention to our hygiene in a bid to keep up with our busy lifestyles. However, Our Cleanliness Is Vital To Our Health\nIt's unforgivable that we brush aside something as crucial as our feminine hygiene for these reasons. We are all aware of the importance of keeping ourselves, all parts of our bodies, particularly our intimate areas clean. Our cleanliness is vital because of the various cycles we go through, including menstruation. Irregular cleaning and poor hygiene during periods can lead to the growth and spread of bacteria in our genitals, with unfortunate repercussions. In this article, we focus on why personal hygiene in women is paramount and ways to attain it. Watch The Video\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel for a wealth of fashion, lifestyle, and beauty publications. How To Develop A Personal Hygiene Routine\nPersonal hygiene means staying healthy and preventing diseases through practices of cleanliness. It involves grooming yourself and making hygienic decisions daily. The best way to keep excellent personal hygiene is to have a daily routine that you strictly maintain. Here are some excellent examples to adapt, and an explanation of why they are essential:\nWash Your Hands Regularly\nWashing hands is a fundamental but essential aspect of hygiene because you regularly use your hands throughout the day. Your hands are one part of your body that easily comes into contact with germs and microorganisms. Colds, flu, coughing, and Hepatitis A are just some of the many diseases you can contract and even spread by having poor hand hygiene. Keep Your Hair Clean\nHair washing is not only necessary for hygienic purposes, but it could be a defining factor in your overall beauty as a woman. Bad hair hygiene can easily cause lice infestation, which is very unpleasant. To avoid this, condition and shampoo your hair at least 2-3 times a week. Don't compromise on this rule. Body odor is not attractive in any way, and not bathing will cause body odor. Also, there are so many harmful microorganisms that you kill by taking a bath, so why avoid one? And there are therapeutic benefits too. Studies show that the body releases serotonin, a hormone that gives a feeling of euphoria, after cold showers. Bathing is especially crucial during our menstrual periods, where poor hygiene (mostly infrequent bathing) could lead to excessive odor. Ok, you don't have to shower every day, but we think you should. Take Care Of Your Lady Parts\nThough the vagina is a self-cleaning organ, you must make an effort to regularly clean your intimate region with water, while only using mild and appropriate cleansers. However, it is essential to note that the vagina has susceptible skin, and using cleansers with strong chemicals can irritate it. To facilitate proper vagina health, always wear comfortable clothing, and be wary of public toilets. Also, during the period of menstruation, maintain proper hygiene by using high-quality tampons and pads like Cora tampons. Steps To Better Vagina Health\nDo Not Engage in Douching\nDouching was predominant in the Victorian Era, and even the Queen of England used it as a means to engage in feminine hygiene. Particularly during periods of menstruation. It is a practice still used today by up to 40% of American women. However, studies show that douching is not so great for your health. Vaginal douching increases the risk of women developing bacterial vaginosis by a whopping five times. But that’s not all, because douching also increases the risk of women getting cervical cancer. A better alternative to approach cleanliness during periods is to allow clear water to run over your lady parts. Also, regularly changing your tampons and wearing breathable tampons is a safer option when it comes to keeping things fresh down there. Shave. But Shave Carefully\nShaving off the hair down there is the in-thing today, and some consider it fashionable, in line with removing other hair on your body.\n\n* Any views expressed in this opinion piece are those of the author and not of Thomson Reuters Foundation. It is time to stop talking and start accelerating efforts to ensure universal access to safe water, sanitation. Health, education, safety, dignity, and basic survival are on the line\nAccess to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene is the key element of the life. Anyone who travels to countries without running water or goes on a backcountry camping trip becomes painfully aware of water’s importance. It is the reason plumbers are so valued in wealthy countries. After all, who wants to live without a functioning toilet? Yet for 2.5 billion people, a toilet of any kind is but a dream. And for 768 million people, safe drinking water is out of reach. Most of these people are women and girls. Life without these services is a life of poor health, nutrition, education and employment. It is a life of walking long distances to collect water, which takes an estimated 26% of women’s time in rural Africa, 40 billion hours total each year; a life of missing school, work, and playtime because, in many cultures, bringing water home is the only priority for women and girls. It is a life without a dignified toilet, a life that leads women and girls to spend 97 billion hours each year finding a place to go. It is a life in which fear of attack, and physical and sexual violence comingle with walking for water and seeking a private place to urinate or defecate. According to research conducted in Bhopal, India, 94% of women interviewed said they had faced violence or harassment when going out to defecate and more than one-third had been physically assaulted. This is the life of women and girls in large part because they are more likely than men and boys to be poor and voiceless. Yet, women also have different needs when it comes to basic services. The reasons for this are both biological and cultural. Women’s ability to reproduce makes the need for safe water, sanitation and hygiene especially important. When a woman is pregnant, access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene can be a matter of life and death. After all, the moments and days surrounding the birth of a child are fragile for both mom and baby; a lack of water for washing is a risk no one should face. 15% of all maternal deaths are caused by infections in the six weeks after childbirth, mainly due to unhygienic conditions and poor infection control during labor and delivery. Likewise, neonatal causes account for 44% of all deaths of children under five; these include infections like sepsis, preventable with good hygiene. Imagine the lives that could be saved. Even if a woman never gets pregnant, they will menstruate. In many places, menstruation is grounds for stigma, discrimination, prohibitions from using shared resources like water taps, and missed school days. Safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene services and education (WASH) can help women and girls remain active in their daily lives. For example, constructing secure, sex-segregated latrines at schools can give girls a place to manage their menstrual hygiene needs, keeping them clean, providing them dignity, and creating a measure of protection against discriminatory cultural norms, such as purity norms that posit that menstruating women will contaminate food or water pumps. Then, perhaps, they can just be students. Community-based education about the importance of equal access to WASH can also help reduce discrimination and lack of access to basic services. For example, I recently had the opportunity to join local WaterAid staff in a village in Papua New Guinea, to speak families about WASH. It took some very gentle prodding, but the women in one extended family finally opened up about menstruation, acknowledging that they had never before spoken about it in front of their husbands—while their husbands looked on silently, even curiously, but did not intervene. These women told me that they leave home when they have their periods, avoiding their community, and aren’t allowed to cook food for men, because of contamination from their impure state. Yet, they also acknowledged that they do not have tools to privately and cleanly manage their periods. While we weren’t there to solve these problems in a single day, I realized that even this most basic of NGO outreach—asking a family to help us understand their lives—broke new ground on hygiene and menstruation. Imagine the changes if everyone had a clean toilet and everything they need to manage menstruation easily and privately.\n\nPerfect grooming exercise:\nBefore being rushed towards the feel of the topic, let me first introduce you to what the given title speaks. Grooming exercises, actually refer a criteria of being continually linked with updating. No matter how you’re there’s always a requirement of upgrading conditions. This upgrading could be in a form of general bath, washing face, clipping nails and etc. Obviously! No matter whichever the gender you’re belonging to, there’s always a necessity for bringing yourself up to date. Correspondingly as how every other component of life contains a criteria of enhancing, humanity requires the given constant criteria. Hence, a perfect grooming exercises has certain things that you should perform. A perfect grooming exercise includes:\nIn addition to what I’ve mentioned above, let’s focus to what we’re going to be discussing further. Men might seem tough to you externally but internally, they seem to be a lot sensitive. So yes, they also do need some sort of grooming exercises for a better health and future. - Good Personal Hygiene:\nWhen it’s about men’s health, personal hygiene becomes as a necessity for sure. Gabriela Cora, MD who’s basically a psychiatrist and holding a huge reputation as a consultant in Miami states that too many guys don’t focus up to the basic hygiene rules. She further speaks a good hygiene seems to be critical, not only to overall men’s health but also to being successful in life. - Wash Your Face Twice a Day:\nIt’s not just termed as a persona’s hygiene rule but also a critical aspect of men’s health. So literate yourselves by being conscious about not utilizing soaps or body gels. Using soap or water could strip your skin off essential moisture and upset its natural pH balance. Instead, a facial cleanser is designed to normalize your pH and restore the moisture-balance. - Changing Underwear:\nOften after a busy routine-work, you might feel as if why you’re even wearing the undergarments. Neglecting their essence could create damages to your persona. Thus, be in them when necessary and keep changing them whenever it’s needed. Though, it’d be quite an outstanding criteria if you’d keep changing them with the intervals of a day. Take shower once in a day-time and before going to bed, if necessary. It’d be a necessity for you to take the shower at least twice a day, if you’ve worked more than 12 hours in that day. Showering is a requirement right after each exercise you do or raise your heartbeat and perspire. - Clipping Nails:\nHey! Don’t you forget to trim your cuticles, those flaps of skin at the sides of your nails! When it’s about grooming, neat and well-groomed nails are on the top of the list. If they’re long enough to collect the dirt then they’re officially prepared to be clipped off. The given exercises, after all my rationale research are the most prominent grooming-exercises which could lead your conditions towards the whole new level of awesomeness. Henceforth, exercise them in your normal life to radiate the enhancement on every passing day.\n\nMaintaining personal hygiene does not simply means getting up in the morning; brushing your teeth; taking a bath; blow drying your hair; using the washroom all throughout the day and then going to bed at night. If this is your routine for maintaining personal hygiene, then it is high time you put more preparation and planning for your health and grooming. Neglecting your health and hygiene might result in various social and health problems that you might even not be aware of. Therefore, it is essential for you to put some good effort and time to feel and to look the best every day. Some tips for maintaining your health and hygiene include:\nHealth And Appearance\nAvoid having alcohol in large quantities. Make it a point not to consume more than three to four units of alcohol every day. This is because having excessive alcohol might hurt your overall health and appearance. Always try to keep your hands clean. Here, hands are being given great importance because it is only in your hands that you have your food. If your hands are not clean, you might end up eating contaminated food which might result in different diseases related to the stomach. Habit Of Smoking\nQuit your habit of smoking. Try avoiding situations that trigger you into smoking. Avoid your cravings by chewing something like lozenges, chewing gum, raw vegetables or nuts. Get sufficient sleep. Sleep in very important for your body, and therefore you must always make it a point to have enough sleep. The Importance Of Good Health\nThere are a lot of people in this world who continuously misuse their bodies in trying to fulfill their dreams of becoming popular. There are others who do not take good care of their health and their bodies by eating unhealthy foods. There are even people who do not drink a lot of water and also refrain from engaging in regular exercises simply ruining their health and their body. People who are continuously stressed and the ones who do not find any relaxation time are also the ones who suffer from poor or bad health. Such people should understand that there is no use outspending your body simply for fulfilling your dreams. You might succeed but only at the cost of your health which will prove to be a bad deal in the future. Good Health Is Important For Every Human Being\nGood health is a state of mental, physical and social well being and not just the absence of different diseases. It is the secret to a happy and fulfilling life that is devoid of all kinds of worries and tension. Good health is the state of being free from mental and bodily diseases while being vigorous at the same time. As a human being, it is vital for you to understand that your health is your greatest possession and you must out in the best efforts in preserving your health for a very long time. Ask the people who have lost their health, and they will tell you about the importance of good health.\n\nIn 2007, the National Public Radio reported that not all Americans value cleanliness. Based on reports, just 66 percent of males remember to wash their hands when necessary; women did better at 88 percent. However, in 2013, The New York Times reported the contrary. It states that Americans might be too obsessed with hygiene; this obsession is brought about by advertising. But obsessed or not, there is no debate that hygiene is important. Neglecting hygiene results in hygiene-related diseases, and this is proven by research. What is hygiene? Hygiene is a general term used to describe the things we do to keep ourselves healthy through cleanliness. There are different types of hygiene: personal and environmental. Personal hygiene is aimed at an individual’s cleanliness. It includes taking care of the body through washing and bathing and keeping all parts of it clean. The hair, teeth, feet, and nails are part of a person’s body that must be kept clean at all times. Personal hygiene also covers grooming. This is why taking care of your clothing and personal appearance is also part of it. Personal hygiene is also associated with etiquette, and this is why people should cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing. In the US, a sign of bad personal hygiene is perceived through body odor. As most Americans are sensitive to scent, they tend to get away from people who have a bad body odor. This is why Americans regularly practice taking a shower, brushing their teeth, changing their clothes, and using deodorants or antiperspirants: to prevent getting that stinky smell. One can say that having personal hygiene is also a sign of respect. As we live in a world where interactions are part of life, having proper personal hygiene is respecting other people while sharing space. It is also protecting them from hygiene-related diseases that one might carry because of lack of hygiene. Environmental hygiene has two categories: domestic and community hygiene. Domestic or home hygiene involves taking care of the home’s cleanliness by using cleaning agents and storing food and waste disposal. Domestic hygiene also includes making sure that households pest like rats and roaches do not invade the home. On the other hand, community hygiene covers proper sanitation and disposal of human wastes, as well as prevention of having vectors in the community that can transmit diseases. Community hygiene also involves controlling one’s contribution to water and air pollution. How important is hygiene? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that hygiene is crucial in preventing the spread of diseases. Some hygiene-related diseases are diarrhea, tooth decay, head lice, and scabies. Harvard adds that hygiene is the simplest way to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The simple act of washing hands can help kill the virus; however, the university reminds people that this act must be done regularly and thoroughly. Aside from preventing diseases and medical conditions, proper personal hygiene improves self-esteem and social relationships. Hence, we can conclude that hygiene is not only important for physical wellness but also social and mental wellness. Best hygiene practices\nMost of the hygiene practices must already be a daily routine. However, for some who have forgotten, here are quick reminders on improving personal hygiene and overall wellness. As consistently mentioned above, washing hands is crucial to avoid spreading disease to yourself and other people. Whenever you do a “dirty job” like taking out the trash and picking out clothes, you should wash your hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds. A good thing is to sing “Happy Birthday” while washing hands. Just like washing your hands is important, washing your intimate parts is important, too. Having a bidet toilet seat can help in that extra fresh feeling when using the toilet. It can prevent UTI, too. Using bidets ensures that bacteria is removed from the body; this bacteria is responsible for urinary tract infections. Taking regular showers can cleanse the whole body. It helps remove dirt and dead skin cells in one’s body that ultimately leads to disease spread prevention. After taking a shower, wear clean clothes; dirty clothes are good breeding grounds for bacteria. Oral hygiene is also important. You might already know from experience that if you have a toothache from decaying teeth, it’s hard to function and perform daily activities, too. Aside from this, having poor oral hygiene turns people off.","passages":[{"passage":"Camping requires you to leave the comforts of a bathroom behind. Here is a guide on how to stay hygienic while camping. You can use these items to clean yourself up, especially if your camping trip extends for days or even weeks. You will never have to worry about staying clean and hygienic. It is very important to keep yourself clean to prevent the onset of illnesses caused by the accumulated bacteria or microorganisms. This is a foldable basin that can serve as your sink. It is made of a cloth material that is waterproof so you can just fold this up into a smaller piece when not in use. You can use this as a makeshift sink for when you are washing your hands or face. This can also be used as a place to wash your dishes. This has handles at the sides so you can actually transform this into a bucket. This is a great invention because it allows you to enjoy hot showers even when you are in the wilderness. This is a shower bag with a solar panel which charges the water heater. You basically fill this bag with water and then hang it up on a tree or something elevated. The solar panel gathers solar energy and converts it into electricity that can heat up your water up to forty-five degrees Celsius. This has power settings so you can adjust the heat level according to your preference. You can now enjoy warm and comfortable showers even in the wild! If you want a simple shower bag, then go for this. This is like the aforementioned product minus the water heater feature. The bag is made of PVC material with great heat retention so it can warm up your water at least. You can fold this bag for transport and then simply unfold it whenever you want to use it. It can carry up to ten gallons of water inside. You can now enjoy a refreshing and relaxing bath anywhere. Here is an easy solution to attain some privacy outdoors. This is a tent that forms a bathroom stall. It has very sturdy poles that can hold it upright and it can withstand windy conditions. You can use this while you are taking a shower or doing other bathroom affairs. Purified water is a must for all of your cleaning needs. It would be impossible to lug around gallons of clean water throughout your trip. The best you can do is to bring a water purifier with you so that you can transform any water source into something you can use. This purifier has three filtration stages for effective cleaning and this can also eliminate various bacteria.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:8f34dd46-be6e-4c0c-ae0e-be1f4c578355>"]},{"passage":"Any number of short to long-term disasters could leave you without power and\/or running water. The result is a serious but difficult topic in prepping: hygiene. Without running water, using your toilet becomes problematic. And showering or bathing is no longer a daily routine that is taken for granted. Without power, you won’t have hot water from the water heater for washing pots, pans, dishes, glasses, or for washing hands. The ideal solution is to have a home with its own well, its own septic system, and a solar and\/or wind source of off-grid power. Then you will be all set. The next best solution is to move in with someone who has that type of home and resources. If these two solutions don’t work for you, read on. Suppose that you no longer have a source of running water or power. What are your options? Fortunately, the typical toilet plumbing does not require electricity. It works by the force of water and gravity. What you do need, to flush the toilet without running water, is plenty of water (a few gallons at least) for each flush. The water need not be drinkable (i.e. potable), but you need about 5 gallons per person per day for flushing (about 1 flush per person per day). Some more efficient toilets might flush with less water, but you are always better off with more water. What this means is that, in addition to your stored drinking water and some water purification equipment, you also need a source of non-drinkable (non-potable) water. You might collect some rainwater, using the rain spouts on your house. Be advised that collecting rain water is actually illegal in some localities. There are some commercial products that capture water from rain gutters and store it in a large barrel (about 50 gallons). One of these on each side of the house is 100 gallons, but only about 20 flushes. You could use water from a swimming pool. Or you might want to have a couple of very large water storage container, very large, kept outdoors for just such an eventuality. But the amount of water needed, say for a month or two without running water, gives you an idea of the scope of the problem. If this type of situation continues long term, you are going to need another approach, but I’m not sure what will work. You could set up an outhouse, or any type of outdoor latrine. There are few other options. Running water is difficult to replace as a part of modern comfortable living. If you are without food, you can grow your own food. If you are without drinking water, you can purify the gallon or so of water you need each day. But without running water, long-term, your options are all not very good. Bathing is another problem when you lack running water. The amount of water needed to shower or fill a bathtub to a shallow extent is at least 5 to 10 gallons. Washing with less water than that is undesirable. You also need water for washing your hands. You can use alcohol-based hand cleanser to a limited extent, to kill bacteria. Eventually, you need to actually wash off dirt and grime. So again the situation requires a substantial amount of water on a monthly basis, if some disaster deprives you of running water. An AquaPod Kit holds about 65 gallons of water in your bathtub (in a plastic bag, essentially). But then you tub is unavailable for use in bathing\/showering. Camping supply stores often have outdoor showering devices that use a limited amount of water, and which could conceivably be used indoors, when you lack running water. I’ll mention a couple of these devices, but I have not tested or evaluated any of them. Zodi Battery-Powered Shower — battery power means that you are not relying only on gravity to deliver a stream of water. Stearns Outdoor SunShower 6.0 — this type of shower is ‘heated’ by the sun striking the black bag of water, meaning that the water is at best warm, but not really hot. It takes 3 hours in the sun, at least, to warm the water. I’m omitting the more expensive devices, such as propane-powered showers with point-of-use water heating built-in. I’m skeptical that this type of device is worth the expense. Another issue raised by a lack of running water is cleaning dishes and cooking utensils. This type of hygiene problem can endanger your health.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:d43eeca1-ef7a-4d3c-8d0d-6d55360ff4e9>"]},{"passage":"Because the tent is one of the most essential aspects of your camping trip, be sure usually the one you will get is suitable.

Washing your hands with soap removes germs that can make you ill. Maintaining good personal hygiene will also help prevent you from spreading diseases to other people. What is personal hygiene? Personal hygiene includes:\n- cleaning your body every day\n- washing your hands with soap after going to the toilet\n- brushing your teeth twice a day\n- covering your mouth and nose with a tissue (or your sleeve) when sneezing or coughing\n- washing your hands after handling pets and other animals\nWhy is personal hygiene important? Good hygiene is vital because it helps prevent you and your children from getting or spreading germs and infectious diseases. The germs that cause many diseases can be passed on through touching other people, getting faeces (poo) on your hands, handling contaminated food and coming into contact with dirty surfaces or objects. Conditions that you can develop if you have poor personal hygiene include:\nWashing your body\nTry to bath or shower each day. Wash well, especially under your armpits and around your genitals and anus. Keeping clean will prevent skin irritations and remove bacteria that cause body odour. Wash yourself with soap, shower gel or a hypoallergenic body wash. Soap removes more germs, but you may need to wash sensitive body parts with plain water or salt water. If there is no tap water or it is scarce, clean yourself with a clean wet cloth or sponge. Washing your hands\nTo avoid getting sick, wash your hands properly. - Wet your hands, then wash with soap or with an alcohol-based hand sanitiser for at least 20 seconds. Lather between the fingers and the back of your hands. - Clean grubby nails with a scrubbing brush, if one is available. - Rinse both sides of your hands, preferably under clean running water. - Dry off your hands with a clean towel or let them dry in the air. When to wash your hands\nIt is especially important to wash your hands after going to the toilet because faeces, which you might come into contact with, contains billions of germs. Also, wash your hands:\n- before and after eating or preparing food\n- after changing babies’ nappies\n- before and after touching a sick person or cleaning up vomit or body fluids\n- after blowing your nose\n- before and after treating cuts or wounds\n- after touching rubbish, dirty surfaces or objects\n- after handling pets or farm animals\nFind out more here about hand washing. Washing your genitals\nMen who are uncircumcised can clean their penis by gently pulling back the foreskin and washing underneath it with warm water or soap. See more here about penis care. Women can gently wash the delicate skin around the vulva with a soap-free wash, salt water or plain water. Avoid perfumed soap and bath products since these may irritate the sensitive skin of the vulva. Do not douche, because it upsets the healthy good bacteria in your vagina. During menstruation (your periods), wash your vulva as usual. Tampons can be changed every 3 to 4 hours. To avoid toxic shock syndrome, do not leave a tampon in for more than 8 hours. Change sanitary pads several times a day. Wash your hands before and after changing tampons or pads. Preventing body odour\nAfter washing, apply deodorant to your armpits. Put on clean, dry clothing. Wash sweaty or dirty garments well and, if possible, hang them outdoors to dry. If you have a problem with excessive sweating, make an appointment to see your doctor. Handling food safely\nWash your hands before and after preparing food. This will stop you contaminating food and will also protect you from getting ill or passing on bacteria from foodstuffs, such as raw meat. Find out more here about food safety. Preventing bad breath\nBad breath can be caused by poor oral hygiene. Brush and floss your teeth twice a day since this reduces gum disease and the chances of future tooth decay.

It's not just less time that is spent on personal hygiene in winter, but less money too. The average monthly spend on personal hygiene products in the UK is £29.57, but 18% of Brits reduce their spending during the winter. Part of the reason for this seasonal difference is that we get less hot and sweaty during the winter months (57% cited this), but many Brits admit that it's simply too cold to shower so frequently in winter. In fact , 34% of us admit to bathing or showering less frequently in the winter, with a quarter of adults preferring to spend more time in bed as the cold dark mornings leave us feeling more tired. Meanwhile 2\/3 of women shave less their legs less frequently in the winter and 56% stated that their feet are neglected in the colder months. Raffaela De Vittorio, Marketing Director for Geberit AquaClean, which conducted the study, said: \"During the winter months many of us would rather grab some extra time under a warm duvet than in the bathroom, which is where the latest shower toilet technology really comes into its own. Gently cleaning you with warm water after each use, the Geberit AquaClean ensures healthy personal hygiene levels are maintained whatever the weather.\" While 15% of Brits would consider installing a shower toilet, currently just 6% of the survey's respondents use one, with the most popular way of cleaning after using the toilet being with wet wipes (40%), followed by showering (19%). However, taking a shower can be time consuming, particularly when compared to using a shower toilet. Despite people taking less time to clean themselves during the winter months, a staggering 10% of adults admit that they don't change their underwear every day, with 1% even owning up to doing so less than once a week! \"The research shows that despite the average Brit spending less time in the bathroom during the winter, their desire to feel fresh and clean is just as strong as in the summer and with so many people admitting to not changing their underwear regularly, a shower toilet ensures that personal hygiene levels are maintained no matter what the season is,\" adds Raffaela.

Traditionally we are the primary caregivers in our families. We prepare food, care for the kids, and ensure the house is clean. In some cases, we are the breadwinner of the family too, having to handle our family responsibilities while working a job or two. Under these circumstances, we might not be able to pay full attention to our hygiene in a bid to keep up with our busy lifestyles. However, Our Cleanliness Is Vital To Our Health\nIt's unforgivable that we brush aside something as crucial as our feminine hygiene for these reasons. We are all aware of the importance of keeping ourselves, all parts of our bodies, particularly our intimate areas clean. Our cleanliness is vital because of the various cycles we go through, including menstruation. Irregular cleaning and poor hygiene during periods can lead to the growth and spread of bacteria in our genitals, with unfortunate repercussions. In this article, we focus on why personal hygiene in women is paramount and ways to attain it. Watch The Video\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel for a wealth of fashion, lifestyle, and beauty publications. How To Develop A Personal Hygiene Routine\nPersonal hygiene means staying healthy and preventing diseases through practices of cleanliness. It involves grooming yourself and making hygienic decisions daily. The best way to keep excellent personal hygiene is to have a daily routine that you strictly maintain. Here are some excellent examples to adapt, and an explanation of why they are essential:\nWash Your Hands Regularly\nWashing hands is a fundamental but essential aspect of hygiene because you regularly use your hands throughout the day. Your hands are one part of your body that easily comes into contact with germs and microorganisms. Colds, flu, coughing, and Hepatitis A are just some of the many diseases you can contract and even spread by having poor hand hygiene. Keep Your Hair Clean\nHair washing is not only necessary for hygienic purposes, but it could be a defining factor in your overall beauty as a woman. Bad hair hygiene can easily cause lice infestation, which is very unpleasant. To avoid this, condition and shampoo your hair at least 2-3 times a week. Don't compromise on this rule. Body odor is not attractive in any way, and not bathing will cause body odor. Also, there are so many harmful microorganisms that you kill by taking a bath, so why avoid one? And there are therapeutic benefits too. Studies show that the body releases serotonin, a hormone that gives a feeling of euphoria, after cold showers. Bathing is especially crucial during our menstrual periods, where poor hygiene (mostly infrequent bathing) could lead to excessive odor. Ok, you don't have to shower every day, but we think you should. Take Care Of Your Lady Parts\nThough the vagina is a self-cleaning organ, you must make an effort to regularly clean your intimate region with water, while only using mild and appropriate cleansers. However, it is essential to note that the vagina has susceptible skin, and using cleansers with strong chemicals can irritate it. To facilitate proper vagina health, always wear comfortable clothing, and be wary of public toilets. Also, during the period of menstruation, maintain proper hygiene by using high-quality tampons and pads like Cora tampons. Steps To Better Vagina Health\nDo Not Engage in Douching\nDouching was predominant in the Victorian Era, and even the Queen of England used it as a means to engage in feminine hygiene. Particularly during periods of menstruation. It is a practice still used today by up to 40% of American women. However, studies show that douching is not so great for your health. Vaginal douching increases the risk of women developing bacterial vaginosis by a whopping five times. But that’s not all, because douching also increases the risk of women getting cervical cancer. A better alternative to approach cleanliness during periods is to allow clear water to run over your lady parts. Also, regularly changing your tampons and wearing breathable tampons is a safer option when it comes to keeping things fresh down there. Shave. But Shave Carefully\nShaving off the hair down there is the in-thing today, and some consider it fashionable, in line with removing other hair on your body.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:44cb67a2-acfc-445e-b0a0-a844062c16b3>"]},{"passage":"* Any views expressed in this opinion piece are those of the author and not of Thomson Reuters Foundation. It is time to stop talking and start accelerating efforts to ensure universal access to safe water, sanitation. Health, education, safety, dignity, and basic survival are on the line\nAccess to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene is the key element of the life. Anyone who travels to countries without running water or goes on a backcountry camping trip becomes painfully aware of water’s importance. It is the reason plumbers are so valued in wealthy countries. After all, who wants to live without a functioning toilet? Yet for 2.5 billion people, a toilet of any kind is but a dream. And for 768 million people, safe drinking water is out of reach. Most of these people are women and girls. Life without these services is a life of poor health, nutrition, education and employment. It is a life of walking long distances to collect water, which takes an estimated 26% of women’s time in rural Africa, 40 billion hours total each year; a life of missing school, work, and playtime because, in many cultures, bringing water home is the only priority for women and girls. It is a life without a dignified toilet, a life that leads women and girls to spend 97 billion hours each year finding a place to go. It is a life in which fear of attack, and physical and sexual violence comingle with walking for water and seeking a private place to urinate or defecate. According to research conducted in Bhopal, India, 94% of women interviewed said they had faced violence or harassment when going out to defecate and more than one-third had been physically assaulted. This is the life of women and girls in large part because they are more likely than men and boys to be poor and voiceless. Yet, women also have different needs when it comes to basic services. The reasons for this are both biological and cultural. Women’s ability to reproduce makes the need for safe water, sanitation and hygiene especially important. When a woman is pregnant, access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene can be a matter of life and death. After all, the moments and days surrounding the birth of a child are fragile for both mom and baby; a lack of water for washing is a risk no one should face. 15% of all maternal deaths are caused by infections in the six weeks after childbirth, mainly due to unhygienic conditions and poor infection control during labor and delivery. Likewise, neonatal causes account for 44% of all deaths of children under five; these include infections like sepsis, preventable with good hygiene. Imagine the lives that could be saved. Even if a woman never gets pregnant, they will menstruate. In many places, menstruation is grounds for stigma, discrimination, prohibitions from using shared resources like water taps, and missed school days. Safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene services and education (WASH) can help women and girls remain active in their daily lives. For example, constructing secure, sex-segregated latrines at schools can give girls a place to manage their menstrual hygiene needs, keeping them clean, providing them dignity, and creating a measure of protection against discriminatory cultural norms, such as purity norms that posit that menstruating women will contaminate food or water pumps. Then, perhaps, they can just be students. Community-based education about the importance of equal access to WASH can also help reduce discrimination and lack of access to basic services. For example, I recently had the opportunity to join local WaterAid staff in a village in Papua New Guinea, to speak families about WASH. It took some very gentle prodding, but the women in one extended family finally opened up about menstruation, acknowledging that they had never before spoken about it in front of their husbands—while their husbands looked on silently, even curiously, but did not intervene. These women told me that they leave home when they have their periods, avoiding their community, and aren’t allowed to cook food for men, because of contamination from their impure state. Yet, they also acknowledged that they do not have tools to privately and cleanly manage their periods. While we weren’t there to solve these problems in a single day, I realized that even this most basic of NGO outreach—asking a family to help us understand their lives—broke new ground on hygiene and menstruation. Imagine the changes if everyone had a clean toilet and everything they need to manage menstruation easily and privately.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:6cb12e0e-b90b-4fc6-a729-cafa991ba3cc>"]},{"passage":"Perfect grooming exercise:\nBefore being rushed towards the feel of the topic, let me first introduce you to what the given title speaks.

So literate yourselves by being conscious about not utilizing soaps or body gels. Using soap or water could strip your skin off essential moisture and upset its natural pH balance. Instead, a facial cleanser is designed to normalize your pH and restore the moisture-balance. - Changing Underwear:\nOften after a busy routine-work, you might feel as if why you’re even wearing the undergarments. Neglecting their essence could create damages to your persona. Thus, be in them when necessary and keep changing them whenever it’s needed. Though, it’d be quite an outstanding criteria if you’d keep changing them with the intervals of a day. Take shower once in a day-time and before going to bed, if necessary. It’d be a necessity for you to take the shower at least twice a day, if you’ve worked more than 12 hours in that day. Showering is a requirement right after each exercise you do or raise your heartbeat and perspire. - Clipping Nails:\nHey! Don’t you forget to trim your cuticles, those flaps of skin at the sides of your nails! When it’s about grooming, neat and well-groomed nails are on the top of the list. If they’re long enough to collect the dirt then they’re officially prepared to be clipped off. The given exercises, after all my rationale research are the most prominent grooming-exercises which could lead your conditions towards the whole new level of awesomeness. Henceforth, exercise them in your normal life to radiate the enhancement on every passing day.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:339dbfc5-671f-4a0d-a72c-0aa23bc48158>"]},{"passage":"Maintaining personal hygiene does not simply means getting up in the morning; brushing your teeth; taking a bath; blow drying your hair; using the washroom all throughout the day and then going to bed at night. If this is your routine for maintaining personal hygiene, then it is high time you put more preparation and planning for your health and grooming. Neglecting your health and hygiene might result in various social and health problems that you might even not be aware of. Therefore, it is essential for you to put some good effort and time to feel and to look the best every day. Some tips for maintaining your health and hygiene include:\nHealth And Appearance\nAvoid having alcohol in large quantities. Make it a point not to consume more than three to four units of alcohol every day. This is because having excessive alcohol might hurt your overall health and appearance. Always try to keep your hands clean. Here, hands are being given great importance because it is only in your hands that you have your food. If your hands are not clean, you might end up eating contaminated food which might result in different diseases related to the stomach. Habit Of Smoking\nQuit your habit of smoking. Try avoiding situations that trigger you into smoking. Avoid your cravings by chewing something like lozenges, chewing gum, raw vegetables or nuts. Get sufficient sleep. Sleep in very important for your body, and therefore you must always make it a point to have enough sleep. The Importance Of Good Health\nThere are a lot of people in this world who continuously misuse their bodies in trying to fulfill their dreams of becoming popular. There are others who do not take good care of their health and their bodies by eating unhealthy foods. There are even people who do not drink a lot of water and also refrain from engaging in regular exercises simply ruining their health and their body. People who are continuously stressed and the ones who do not find any relaxation time are also the ones who suffer from poor or bad health. Such people should understand that there is no use outspending your body simply for fulfilling your dreams. You might succeed but only at the cost of your health which will prove to be a bad deal in the future. Good Health Is Important For Every Human Being\nGood health is a state of mental, physical and social well being and not just the absence of different diseases. It is the secret to a happy and fulfilling life that is devoid of all kinds of worries and tension. Good health is the state of being free from mental and bodily diseases while being vigorous at the same time. As a human being, it is vital for you to understand that your health is your greatest possession and you must out in the best efforts in preserving your health for a very long time. Ask the people who have lost their health, and they will tell you about the importance of good health.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:16c86544-5edb-48e7-8620-7e529d158f9d>"]},{"passage":"In 2007, the National Public Radio reported that not all Americans value cleanliness. Based on reports, just 66 percent of males remember to wash their hands when necessary; women did better at 88 percent. However, in 2013, The New York Times reported the contrary. It states that Americans might be too obsessed with hygiene; this obsession is brought about by advertising. But obsessed or not, there is no debate that hygiene is important. Neglecting hygiene results in hygiene-related diseases, and this is proven by research. What is hygiene? Hygiene is a general term used to describe the things we do to keep ourselves healthy through cleanliness. There are different types of hygiene: personal and environmental. Personal hygiene is aimed at an individual’s cleanliness. It includes taking care of the body through washing and bathing and keeping all parts of it clean. The hair, teeth, feet, and nails are part of a person’s body that must be kept clean at all times. Personal hygiene also covers grooming. This is why taking care of your clothing and personal appearance is also part of it. Personal hygiene is also associated with etiquette, and this is why people should cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing. In the US, a sign of bad personal hygiene is perceived through body odor. As most Americans are sensitive to scent, they tend to get away from people who have a bad body odor. This is why Americans regularly practice taking a shower, brushing their teeth, changing their clothes, and using deodorants or antiperspirants: to prevent getting that stinky smell. One can say that having personal hygiene is also a sign of respect. As we live in a world where interactions are part of life, having proper personal hygiene is respecting other people while sharing space. It is also protecting them from hygiene-related diseases that one might carry because of lack of hygiene. Environmental hygiene has two categories: domestic and community hygiene. Domestic or home hygiene involves taking care of the home’s cleanliness by using cleaning agents and storing food and waste disposal. Domestic hygiene also includes making sure that households pest like rats and roaches do not invade the home. On the other hand, community hygiene covers proper sanitation and disposal of human wastes, as well as prevention of having vectors in the community that can transmit diseases. Community hygiene also involves controlling one’s contribution to water and air pollution. How important is hygiene? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that hygiene is crucial in preventing the spread of diseases. Some hygiene-related diseases are diarrhea, tooth decay, head lice, and scabies. Harvard adds that hygiene is the simplest way to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The simple act of washing hands can help kill the virus; however, the university reminds people that this act must be done regularly and thoroughly. Aside from preventing diseases and medical conditions, proper personal hygiene improves self-esteem and social relationships. Hence, we can conclude that hygiene is not only important for physical wellness but also social and mental wellness. Best hygiene practices\nMost of the hygiene practices must already be a daily routine. However, for some who have forgotten, here are quick reminders on improving personal hygiene and overall wellness. As consistently mentioned above, washing hands is crucial to avoid spreading disease to yourself and other people. Whenever you do a “dirty job” like taking out the trash and picking out clothes, you should wash your hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds. A good thing is to sing “Happy Birthday” while washing hands. Just like washing your hands is important, washing your intimate parts is important, too. Having a bidet toilet seat can help in that extra fresh feeling when using the toilet. It can prevent UTI, too. Using bidets ensures that bacteria is removed from the body; this bacteria is responsible for urinary tract infections. Taking regular showers can cleanse the whole body. It helps remove dirt and dead skin cells in one’s body that ultimately leads to disease spread prevention. After taking a shower, wear clean clothes; dirty clothes are good breeding grounds for bacteria. Oral hygiene is also important. You might already know from experience that if you have a toothache from decaying teeth, it’s hard to function and perform daily activities, too. Aside from this, having poor oral hygiene turns people off.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:8966706c-efe6-4dc8-90d8-a1012608d4a6>"]}]}

Many of the groups coming together are activist groups focused on political, civil rights, or social justice agendas. Other groups bring members together around special interests, or are more supportive in nature. Whatever the purpose of your group effort, I thought it might be timely to talk about the process of forming a group.\nWhile you may have thought that setting up a new group is a simple process, it might prove a bit more complicated than you thought. Group development generally involves more than just getting a group of people into the same room. All groups go through fairly predictable stages, though, so understanding those stages is a good place to start and will help you understand the process as it unfolds.\nThe popular model of group development stages created by Bruce Tuckman (1965) outlines four stages in the life of a group: 1) forming, 2) storming, 3) norming, and 4) performing. Some later permutations of this model also include a fifth stage, called alternatively “adjourning” or “mourning.” I’ll talk about each stage and the challenges that can arise, but first I think it’s important to consider what exactly you hope to accomplish with your group, and to do a little bit of preparation.\nThe first question you’ll need to answer is what it is you hope to accomplish with your group. What is your purpose? Do you have a specific project or task that needs to be completed, or a particular goal in mind? Is it intended to be a loosely organized but supportive group for members sharing a problem or concern, or does it need to be laser focused on getting a job done by deadline?\nSecondly, think about who you want to have as members. If you have a specific task to accomplish, what skills will be required, and who has the needed skills? If you are hoping to address a social problem, who else might be interested in working with you? If the group will be more supportive in nature, what is the population you want to bring into the fold?\nAlso, consider what might be the optimal size for your group. For most task-oriented groups, 6 – 12 is a workable number. Smaller groups can be effective as well, however if you have only 3 – 4 members, absences can render your group temporarily ineffective. Larger groups can also work, however they tend to require more formal organization and leadership, and it may be more difficult to harness individual creativity and foster group cohesion in a larger group. Larger groups are also more prone to forming unintended subgroups, which can promote conflict, so consider whether you really need or want a large group for your project. Bigger is not necessarily better.\nOnce you have an appropriately sized group of the right people devoted to a common cause or purpose, you are ready to begin. Set up your meeting time and place, and get to work!\nThe forming stage is the first stage of group development. This stage encompasses the first and possibly several early meetings, as group members get to know each other, exchange information and ideas, and make early decisions about how they will proceed. Usually everyone is on their best behavior at the beginning. Members are checking each other out, forming opinions about the nature of the group and what their place in it may be, and trying to make a good first impression. Early group meetings tend to be cordial and to run fairly smoothly. The important work at this stage consists of forming early relationships, delineating why you are there, and deciding how you will move forward as a group. While this stage may be pleasant, you don’t want to stay here indefinitely. If a group stalls here, it may be a signal that members don’t feel comfortable, or that there is conflict brewing that is not coming out into the open. It may also indicate that members are not strongly attached to the group’s purpose.\nThe second stage of group development–storming–involves conflict. It is at this stage that disagreements and personality conflicts start to appear, and competition for control of certain group functions arises. If you have done a good job of selecting your group members, their common purpose will help them get past this stage and move on to productive work. If not, the conflict may be more protracted. During this stage the group needs to learn how to manage their differences and cooperate towards common goals. Problems can develop if there is serious disagreement around the group’s purpose, if power struggles go unresolved, or if a single bully or a powerful subgroup sets out to impose their will on others. It is generally preferable to work through conflicts rather than ignoring or submerging them, as unresolved issues may continue to undermine the group efforts going forward.\nSome group members may believe that conflict at this stage indicates something is wrong, but it is a normal stage in group development. The important thing is that conflicts are resolved constructively.\nThe the third stage of group development is called norming. This is when the group begins to develop their way of doing things. They settle issues around what is expected of group members, who will do what, how decisions will be made, and how differences will be managed. The group may develop formal rules, but they certainly will develop informal rules, or procedures that everybody knows are there even though they may not be openly acknowledged. Groups emerging from this stage are ready to settle down to work, and their members have a pretty good idea what is expected of them. They have also learned a few things about how to work with each other successfully. Sometimes unresolved conflicts from the storming stage re-emerge, and the group is temporarily thrust back into storming until they are resolved.\nThe performing stage, the fourth stage of group development, is when most of the productive work gets done. This can be brief in a temporary group formed around specific tasks, or it can go on for a lengthy period of time. A highly productive group in which there remains agreement around purpose, and in which members are committed to working together towards their mutual goals can perform well for years. There will be challenges as old members are lost, new ones are brought into the group, and occasional conflicts are resolved. There may also be new challenges when norms require updating, however a committed group may resolve them and continue to thrive. It may seem that the group must occasionally revisit an earlier stage, but it then returns to productivity. The performing stage is the reason we form groups to begin with. It is important to note, however, that it is only one stage. It is unrealistic to expect your group to perform optimally without ever going through the other stages.\nAdjourning or Mourning\nAt some point every group comes to an end. It may be that their goals have been met and their mission accomplished. It may be that things have changed and the group no longer perceives a need to continue, or that continued performance would depend on making changes that the group members are unwilling to make. Sometimes the group makes a conscious choice to dissolve. Other times a group may just fade and become inactive over time. In some cases, the group may be dissolved involuntarily due to adverse circumstances. Regardless of how a group reaches its ending point, there may be a certain sense of loss or a period of mourning for group members. Eventually they will go their separate ways and move on to other projects. Ideally, efforts will be made to end in a positive manner, and to help group members feel good about what they have accomplished together.\nImportant Note: This blog is intended for informational and discussion purposes only, and does not substitute for professional care.

It took time to ensure that group members hadn’t previously worked together (though this was almost impossible by the last couple of projects). This mixed solution had the added benefit of helping me sometimes find “better” fits for some group members whom I thought would benefit more by working with other students in particular. Overall, I thought working with new people mimicked how real world jobs work. We typically don’t get to choose who our team members are and so learning how to navigate such group politics and issues while working towards a common goal is invaluable. Also, it continually helped teach the valuing of assessing people’s skills and knowledge at the outset and applying that information to the project at hand. And perhaps more importantly in terms of college, it helped connect people who otherwise may have never had the opportunity of meeting one another. One of the most rewarding things about such a class is receiving an email from a former student who happens to mention still being in contact with former group-mates. So what makes a good group size? I’ve tried from 2 to 6 members early on. 2 member groups are too small–if one person was sick or decided to drop the course or just plain wasn’t working, that meant that the other person had to bear the responsibility for the entire project alone. 5 and 6 member groups are too large–mainly from a logistic perspective; that is, although I made some class time available for the groups to work on their projects, the majority of the work was done outside the classroom; accomodating that many different class and work schedules can be very difficult. I found that 3-4 people sized groups is the sweet spot (though depending on the project, even 4 can be a little too much to divide the responsibilities). This allowed groups to recover from for the absence of a member, added the brainstorming power of divergent perspectives, and perhaps more importantly, an provided the opportunity for an equitable division of labor. As I mentioned, most group work was done outside of the classroom. To get groups to thinking about potential challenges, we discussed the pros and cons of face-to-face meetings as well as synchronous and asynchronous technological tools (email, texting, video conferencing, phone calls, etc). Some groups always met face-to-face (like at the library), and some groups tried using only email. The most seemingly productive groups tended to use a combination of face-to-face meetings and distance communication tools. These groups typically began with a face-t0-face meeting, brainstorming on a project goal and developing a temporary plan and schedule. They would use this plan to set up dates\/times and methods of communication. I also I created Moodle forums for each group that were only visible to their members. However, almost no groups ever used them (and even then, only initially), though this did vary from semester to semester. For assignments, I required that in addition to one hard-copy being turned in, each group member uploaded digital files to Moodle. They had to turn in the same copy; I had each member turn in a separate copy for accounting reasons. Although Moodle lets you filter the class by groups on its grading page, I want to be sure I was working with the correct people–and, it also was another way to encourage member participation by making their accountability very visible (if they were not doing the work, it would be highly unlikely that the other members would share their files). About those “Digital files”: since Microsoft Office was freely available on campus computers in the library and various labs, and since I also have my own copy of that produce, I stipulated that the file formats had to be in one of the Office file formats (such as .docx) or .rtf (rich text format). But I did not want to limit students to a particular software package, so I also allowed for any program that could save or print to a .pdf file. And in the case where some projects were more of a physical nature (the Packaging project, for example), they could take digital pictures and upload those to Moodle. Typically, most projects were created digitally, but I also felt it was helpful to see hard copy manifestations of it (again, such as the Packaging Project). This also meant that I did not teach any particular program, although I would demonstrate useful tips and tricks within Word or other tools.\n\nAdmittedly, the second half sentence “why we should communicate less” is provocative in the modern world of work, but true. But more about that later …\nBy the very hear-worth Podcast “Führungs auf den Punkt gebracht” by leadership coach Bernd Geropp a topic came to me, over which I wanted to blog for a long time: The ideal team size and the dangerously rising communication effort with too large teams. The magic number 7\nIn the Episode 165 of the podcast Bernd Geropp describes the ideal leadership span, i.e. the number of people that can be meaningfully led by a manager. The findings can be applied thereby not only to high-level personnel, but also and particularly with self-leading agile teams. He mentions an article of Professor Dr. Wolfgang Grunwald, work and industrial psychologist. It is shown that groups in the cultural history always consist of approx. 7 humans and larger groups inevitably fall into smaller groups. (For further background information I recommend the podcast or a Google search for the article “Psychologische Gesetzmäßigkeiten der Gruppenarbeit” [Psychological laws of group work].) I found the article and podcast so interesting because it’s more than 20 years old, but picks up on things I first learned in agile teams and UX:\nHick’s law and the magic 7\nIn UX we often speak of Hick’s Law. It describes the relationship between response time and number of choices. In short: With the number of options our reaction time increases. With about 7 options the reaction time is more than one second. This time can only be reduced by training. With UX and web designers the rule of thumb has established itself, never to offer more than 7 options e.g. in the main menu or to display at the same time. Brooks’s Law and the communication paths\nBrook’s Law by the American computer pioneer Fred Brooks states that adding more people to a delayed software project will increase the implementation time, not decrease it. [pullquote align=”right” cite=”Fred Brooks” tweet=”true”]adding human resources to a late software project makes it later[\/pullquote]\nIn addition to the difficult induction and the complex special tasks involved in software development, this is also due to the higher communication effort within the team. The non-linear growth of communication paths according to team size\nIn addition to the formula behind Hick’s Law, another formula is interesting. It describes the possible lines of communication of people, if everyone would have to coordinate with everyone:\nn × (n-1) \/ 2\nCommunication does not increase linearly with the number of people:\n- For 2 persons it is 1 connection\n- For 3 persons there are 3 connections\n- For 4 persons there are 6 connections\n- For 10 persons there are already 45 connections! (Very impressive in this context also this graphic from Stackoverflow.) If we now take our rule of thumb discovered in Hick’s Law, we have a manageable amount of communication lines somewhere with 5-7 people, depending on how many active\/extroverted participants there are. Small anecdote: I recently participated in a workshop with about 35 participants. What do you think: how many possible communication channels would that have been? I’ll tell you: 595. Agile teams and methods of communication avoidance\nCommunication avoidance sounds absurd at first. We are an agile team, we do dailies, we have product owners who manage stakeholders, we have extensive retrospectives. We should avoid communication? Yes! We’re already doing it! In the Wikipedia article on Brook’s Law there are a few limitations: His law dates back to 1975. Today, there are many things that actively avoid communication because they are convention:\n- Scrum Meetings with fixed Timebox\n- Design Patterns and Coding Guidelines, which define certain formalities at work\n- Modern practices such as Continuous Integration or Iterative development make a large part of the coordination between developers superfluous or reduce it strongly. 5 Rules for effective avoidance Communication\nOn this basis you can summarize 5 simple rules, as well as you can reduce your communication outside of agile teams and achieve more:\n- Creates standards and rules\nStandard meetings like in Scrum, email rules like: “Don’t answer when you’re in CC” or “Only answer in case of emergency”. - Shared Meetings\nPick up participants individually or in small groups. Resists the temptation to coordinate everything in a big, clarifying conversation.\n\nDifference between revisions of \"TeamUp\"\n(→Perfect repartition is not always possible)\n(→Perfect repartition is not always possible)\n|Line 148:||Line 148:|\n== Perfect repartition is not always possible ==\n== Perfect repartition is not always possible ==\nNote that, depending on student responses, it may happen that no group composition is perfectly optimal.

Manual adaptations can sometimes help to balance groups, but in some cases it is impossible to make all to be validated. Then save a partially optimal composition or possibly test another composition with less restrictive criteria. Revision as of 23:36, 7 June 2019\nDo you dream of composing groups on the basis of criteria, such as gathering students on the basis of their preference for work topics or mixing students according to their orientation ? The TeamUp activity allows the teacher to define a questionnaire and to compose groups, taking into account student responses. The TeamUp activity first enables you to compose a questionnaire with multiple choice questions with possibility of restrictions on the answers .For example, it is possible to require the student to tick exactly 2 options from the list of available options. The questionnaire is available to students on the opening date and they can respond to it. As soon as the closing date has passed, the teacher can start the group composition using four approaches :\n- group similar individuals;\n- disperse similar individuals;\n- avoid minorities ;\n- balance the skill level (based on a question with numerical options). Several criteria can be combined to compose the groups and the tool provides a diagnosis on the number of optimal groups. - 1 Create a TeamUp activity\n- 2 Create a questionnaire with distribution criteria\n- 3 Publish the questionnaire and collect student responses\n- 4 Generate groups\n- 5 Perfect repartition is not always possible\nCreate a TeamUp activity\n- a name and an introduction to the activity to present this activity;\n- an opening date from which students will be able to answer the questionnaire (as a result, the questions then can not be modified when this date is passed);\n- a closing date from which student responses will no longer be allowed;\n- the parameter \"Allow updating of answers\" specifies whether you allow students to modify their answers during the opening period of the questionnaire;\nCreate a questionnaire with distribution criteria\nGo to the Questionnaire tab to build the multiple-choice questions that will allow students to provide useful information for group composition. Type your question and define the associated restrictions on the possible answers :\n- none : the student can select any number of options, or none at all;\n- at least one check mark : the student must select at least one option;\n- exactly 1 check mark : the student must select one and only one option;\n- exactly 2 check marks : the student must select exactly 2 options;\n- exactly 3 check marks : the student must select exactly 3 options. When your questionnaire is finalized, you can preview it via the Preview Questions tab . For example, your questions may include the time range for student availability for group meetings (to group them), their curriculum (to mix), their gender (to avoid minorities), their preference thematic (to group them), on their average score over the past year exam (to balance the level of the groups), ... If you want your students to select several options from a list, for example to choose a discussions theme, we advise you to avoid questions that require you to make hierarchical choices (first choice, second choice, ... ). This type of question has two disadvantages :\n- we can not prevent a student from making the same choice 3 times and the algorithm can only attribute this choice to him;\n- the criteria based on hierarchical choices are very restrictive for the distribution algorithm, so that optimal groups are difficult to obtain and, therefore, an unfair distribution for the students. Publish the questionnaire and collect student responses\nWhen your questionnaire is ready, you can change its opening date to make it accessible to students. Do not hesitate to invite your students to answer the questionnaire by using the Moodle Annoucements. You will be able to observe the answers evolution via the Compose groups tab : the students who answered are shown in blue while the students who have not yet responded are displayed in red . If some students do not answer the questionnaire, it do not block the groups composition. They are then randomly placed to complete the groups and you can also move them manually.\n\nSecurity, Group Size, and the Human Brain\nIf the size of your company grows past 150 people, it’s time to get name badges. It’s not that larger groups are somehow less secure, it’s just that 150 is the cognitive limit to the number of people a human brain can maintain a coherent social relationship with. Primatologist Robin Dunbar derived this number by comparing neocortex — the “thinking” part of the mammalian brain — volume with the size of primate social groups. By analyzing data from 38 primate genera and extrapolating to the human neocortex size, he predicted a human “mean group size” of roughly 150. This number appears regularly in human society; it’s the estimated size of a Neolithic farming village, the size at which Hittite settlements split, and the basic unit in professional armies from Roman times to the present day. Larger group sizes aren’t as stable because their members don’t know each other well enough. Instead of thinking of the members as people, we think of them as groups of people. For such groups to function well, they need externally imposed structure, such as name badges. Of course, badges aren’t the only way to determine in-group\/out-group status. Other markers include insignia, uniforms, and secret handshakes. They have different security properties and some make more sense than others at different levels of technology, but once a group reaches 150 people, it has to do something. More generally, there are several layers of natural human group size that increase with a ratio of approximately three: 5, 15, 50, 150, 500, and 1500 — although, really, the numbers aren’t as precise as all that, and groups that are less focused on survival tend to be smaller. The layers relate to both the intensity and intimacy of relationship and the frequency of contact. The smallest, three to five, is a “clique”: the number of people from whom you would seek help in times of severe emotional distress. The twelve to 20 group is the “sympathy group”: people with which you have special ties. After that, 30 to 50 is the typical size of hunter-gatherer overnight camps, generally drawn from the same pool of 150 people. No matter what size company you work for, there are only about 150 people you consider to be “co-workers.” (In small companies, Alice and Bob handle accounting. In larger companies, it’s the accounting department — and maybe you know someone there personally.) The 500-person group is the “megaband,” and the 1,500-person group is the “tribe.” Fifteen hundred is roughly the number of faces we can put names to, and the typical size of a hunter-gatherer society. These numbers are reflected in military organization throughout history: squads of 10 to 15 organized into platoons of three to four squads, organized into companies of three to four platoons, organized into battalions of three to four companies, organized into regiments of three to four battalions, organized into divisions of two to three regiments, and organized into corps of two to three divisions. Coherence can become a real problem once organizations get above about 150 in size. So as group sizes grow across these boundaries, they have more externally imposed infrastructure — and more formalized security systems. In intimate groups, pretty much all security is ad hoc. Companies smaller than 150 don’t bother with name badges; companies greater than 500 hire a guard to sit in the lobby and check badges. The military have had centuries of experience with this under rather trying circumstances, but even there the real commitment and bonding invariably occurs at the company level. Above that you need to have rank imposed by discipline. The whole brain-size comparison might be bunk, and a lot of evolutionary psychologists disagree with it. But certainly security systems become more formalized as groups grow larger and their members less known to each other. When do more formal dispute resolution systems arise: town elders, magistrates, judges? At what size boundary are formal authentication schemes required? Small companies can get by without the internal forms, memos, and procedures that large companies require; when does what tend to appear? How does punishment formalize as group size increase? And how do all these things affect group coherence? People act differently on social networking sites like Facebook when their list of “friends” grows larger and less intimate.\n\nI’ve mentioned in several blog entries that I am a member of a Mastermind Group, and people often ask me a variety of questions about how my meeting is structured and run. Since I think Mastermind Groups are a wonderful tool for personal growth and connection, I’d like to share some of the details about how my group works which will help you form and run your own group. In essence, a Mastermind Group is a group that helps you become a vibrational match for your goals or your intentions. The belief is that your group members know you so well, they can tell when you are not really a vibrational match for your desire, so they will help you locate blocks or help you craft an intention that is in alignment with who you are and what you want. How many people are in the group? My group has 6 members. Sometimes someone takes a break for a few months if their schedule gets too full, if they’re traveling, or if they just need a break. Sometimes a member will bring a guest to a meeting to see if they are a good fit for the group. We generally have the guest come to a few meetings so we can get a feel for her and for her to decide if joining our group is something she’s really interested in. But generally speaking, we keep the number at 6 or 7. The number of people in the Mastermind is really up to each group, but I think 5-7 people is ideal. If the group is too big you can sometimes lose the intimate connection as people split into cliques or sub groups. Or your meetings can take 2 hours. If the group is too small you don’t get the wisdom of a larger collective, and if people are absent you could be at your meeting with just one other person. How often do you meet? My group meets every other week. Even if someone can’t make the meeting, we don’t try to find a day when everyone can make it. We stick to our schedule and whoever can come, comes. Most of the time, every member is present. It works best that way if the members are committed to attending every meeting. I think meeting once a month is not quite enough because a lot can happen in a month and if you miss even one meeting then you’re really going long without your supportive group. Meeting weekly is also a good option if everyone is comfortable meeting that often. How long are your meetings? We meet for one hour, however we have learned to reserve some time after our meeting for chatting about other things going on in our lives. During the meeting, we are all business, otherwise it’s easy to get sidetracked. Sometimes a member is going through a personal crisis, but we honor our meeting structure and then spend time after the meeting helping her with practical solutions to her problem. Is your group for women only? We tested out having men in our group but decided it changed the energy and dynamic too much, so now we’re a woman-only group. You can specify a gender or invite anyone. It all depends on what kind of energy you want to create and how compatible everyone is with each other. Compatible energy is more important than gender. Where do you meet? Our group meets at the home of one of our members. You can meet in a conference room, a park, a restaurant, or really anywhere that you can ensure privacy, because you need to be able to be emotionally intimate with your members. You can rotate the home in which you have your meetings to make it fair for everyone. How do you find members? Adding new members to my group usually happens when one of us brings a friend who we think would be interested in joining and also be a good fit for our other members. I think it’s vital that you don’t add new members if someone who is already in the group opposes the addition of a new member for whatever reason. There is a great deal of trust involved in having a Mastermind Group and if someone would feel uncomfortable with the addition of another member then it’s not worth adding the new person. If you’re just starting out, I recommend picking people who share a similar vibration to you. Perhaps a close friend. But just because someone is your friend doesn’t mean they will be a good member of a Mastermind Group. To function well, members should be emotionally mature, respect confidential personal information you may discuss at meetings, be reasonably intelligent, and kind. Pick other attributes as best suits your group’s intention (i.e. business minded, other parents, women only, etc.). What happens at the meetings themselves? We start our meetings by reading our Declarations For Mastermind which is simply a list of our group’s goals and guidelines.\n\nGroups are extremely buzzword compliant. You get active engagement, collaboration, and become a facilitator all in one move. Well, provided you are secretly pulling the strings behind the scenes and have enough tasks to fill the time. I hypothosized about it previously, and now I think I have a good plan. It could all explode in my face and I'll have to retool, but here's how it's going to work. Week 1 and 2 are Boot Camp. This year I have Pre-Cal and Algebra II, so they're both getting it. Algebra II will be a little modified and approached differently. Several of the topics covered fit in nicely with the first few sections, others should probably wait until later, and the degree of difficulty will need to be adjusted. After Boot Camp, the class will be split into groups. Class sizes indicate that 6 groups of 5 is the way to go for me. Desk arrangement is the fun part of that one. Desks are labeled 1-5, each group is a color. I will change the groups every so often, probably at grading period end. Big picture class format:\n- Instead of homework, a task will be given to each student when we start new topics\n- The task will cover all items ahead of us with a large problem set, sourced from a textbook to save time\n- Each group member must complete the task prior to a test, the task serves double duty as the review\n- The task will cover problems that require more than one mind to figure out\n- Those harder task problems will be intended for class discussion\n- How and when the students complete the task is up to them, there will be some time in class for this purpose\n- Tasks are pasted into a notebook, no task is accepted outside of a notebook\n- Each student will keep a notebook where all tasks, warm ups, examples, \"now you try\", WCYDWT questions live\n- Students will be assessed on the topics of the week frequently\nThis format will reign most of the time unless I have something special in mind. Calculators and voting devices will be kept in the vicinity of the group rather than in a central location to minimize foot traffic and readiness time. Grading expectations are as follows:\nHow I determine that 10% Group portion is still being worked out. Part of it should include assessment from the group members to add a little fear that your teammates will flunk you if you're a punk. Notebooks are collected\/inspected prior to reporting periods and must have whatever tasks I feel should have been completed by then. Algebra II will be tested in a Standards Based format, so it is expected that they'll have all their test scores recorded as well. In the future, possibly second semester, I hope to find a way to award groups points as we go along, similar to what they do on Around the Horn (an ESPN show, sportswriters are voted up\/down by the host based on what they say and eventually one writer \"wins\"). College gave me the idea for a single, large, weekly assignment and group member evaluation, and the whole concept from my 6th grade math teacher. Lastly, randomizing and rotating is a big part of active engagement, and what does any mega nerd with an engineering degree do to address this? Popsicle sticks, right? No!

This process can be used for three purposes:\n- Create a list of duties for a job. - Create a list of tasks needed to perform each duty. - Identifying the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed for each task. Here’s how the process works:\n- Gather a group of “experts” for a particular job. - Have each expert make their own list of that they believe the duties to be. - Starting with one person, have him\/her read out loud one of the identified duties. - Others in the group will likely have that duty, as well. - As a group, decide if it is a duty or a task that fits into a larger duty. - If others have that duty on their list, come to consensus on the best wording for the duty. - Write the duty in large letters on an 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper, and tape it to the wall. - Everyone crosses that duty off their list. - Move on to the next person, have him\/her read off another duty. Repeat step 4. - Continue around the room until everyone has provided a duty, then start over with the first person again and keep going around the room until everyone’s list is exhausted. - There should be between five and fourteen duties on the wall. If more than fourteen exist, look at how some of the duties could be combined so that no more than fourteen exist. - If there are less than five, it may be that some duties have been defined too broadly. Consider which ones may be too comprehensive and break them down, if needed. - Prioritize the duties by starting with three groups:\n- Which are the highest priority duties? Move those to one side of the wall. - Which are the lowest priority duties? Move those to the other side of the wall. - Now that three groups exist, prioritize the duties in each group. This gives you an overall priority list. - Take each duty and repeat the Nominal Group Technique to determine each set of tasks. Instead of prioritizing each completed list, order them for optimal efficiency to perform the duty. Repeat the process, but take each task and brainstorm the necessary knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed to accomplish each task. Instead of prioritizing the KSA’s place them in the most appropriate order for people to learn how to perform each task.\n\nAnother issue of an occasional series—Dear Adrian—in which I answer questions about event design, elementary particle physics, solar hot water systems, facilitation, and anything else I might conceivably know something about. If you have a question you’d like me to answer, please contact me (don’t worry, I won’t publish anything without your permission). Here’s a great question from Australian facilitator, trainer, and coach Steve Rohan-Jones about … The Three Questions! (Check out the link if you aren’t already familiar with The Three Questions, otherwise what you are about to read won’t make much sense.) Good morning from Canberra, Adrian,\nI have just read through The Power of Participation over one year after I received a signed copy from you! In short, I have a question about The Three Questions. I understand the process both in singular and multiple form (combined with round tables). From my reading, The Three Questions appears to take some time (based on the amount of participants) with only one person speaking. This appears at odds with the aim to get people engaged in conversation. I would also think – not a question just an observation – that group of 6 would be better. This would speed up the set piece of one person speaking and others listening, reduce the need for breaks and keep the energy going early in the day. Can you clarify my understanding of The Three Questions? I look forward to hearing from you. O2C Pty Ltd\nSteve, I like your question because it highlights a key tension inherent in group process design: the tension between intimacy (going deep with a few) and discovery (uncovering the possibilities of the many). Let’s explore this in more detail. When people are meeting for a shared purpose, some of the potentially valuable outcomes include:\n- Learning about each other. - Being and feeling heard. - Sharing with each other. - Learning from each other. The Three Questions focuses on #1, #2, and #3. I love to use it at the start of an event or workshop, because we can’t really learn effectively from our peers (#4) until we:\n- have learnt what they might have to offer (#1);\n- feel safe sharing with them (#2); and\n- have each had an opportunity to share our own expertise and experience (#3). Because each person gets the same amount of time to share their answers to The Three Questions to a group, the time needed to run the process is proportional to the group’s size. [I’m neglecting here the few minutes needed to a) explain the process and b) provide one or two short breaks for large groups.] In practice, I’ve found this restricts the maximum effective size of a single group using The Three Questions to 60 people. If more than 60 people are present, you divide them into smaller groups and run multiple simultaneous The Three Questions sessions. Even if we have 60 people or less, we may still decide to divide our group into several smaller groups and run multiple simultaneous sessions. Typically we’ll do this when time is a constraint. For example, next month I’m leading a two-hour, ~200 person, participation techniques workshop. In order to cover multiple core techniques in two hours with this many participants, I will give them just a taste of The Three Questions by running 30+ concurrent 6-person groups. Everyone will know five former strangers much better after the ~20 minute session is over, but they won’t have learned more about the others in the room. So when designing a session or conference that includes The Three Questions, there is a trade-off between the time we have or want to allocate and group size, because we need to give each person sufficient time for meaningful sharing with their group (typically 1 – 2 minutes per person). There’s no single answer for this design decision that’s optimum for all circumstances. At a multi-day conference, for example, it makes sense to run multiple simultaneous 50-60 person Three Questions groups for a couple of hours at the start of the event. Everyone in each group will learn important information about the interests and resources of their 50-60 peers. For a monthly board meeting, once a year I might run a single session with the ten board members to remind the group of each member’s “why?”. And at a one-day peer conference with ninety participants, perhaps three simultaneous 30-person sessions would be the way to go. In some ways this design consideration is a parallel application of Jerry Weinberg’s Law of Raspberry Jam:\nThe wider you spread it, the thinner it gets.","passages":[{"passage":"We seem to be seeing a surge in new group development lately. Many of the groups coming together are activist groups focused on political, civil rights, or social justice agendas. Other groups bring members together around special interests, or are more supportive in nature. Whatever the purpose of your group effort, I thought it might be timely to talk about the process of forming a group. While you may have thought that setting up a new group is a simple process, it might prove a bit more complicated than you thought. Group development generally involves more than just getting a group of people into the same room. All groups go through fairly predictable stages, though, so understanding those stages is a good place to start and will help you understand the process as it unfolds. The popular model of group development stages created by Bruce Tuckman (1965) outlines four stages in the life of a group: 1) forming, 2) storming, 3) norming, and 4) performing. Some later permutations of this model also include a fifth stage, called alternatively “adjourning” or “mourning.” I’ll talk about each stage and the challenges that can arise, but first I think it’s important to consider what exactly you hope to accomplish with your group, and to do a little bit of preparation. The first question you’ll need to answer is what it is you hope to accomplish with your group. What is your purpose? Do you have a specific project or task that needs to be completed, or a particular goal in mind? Is it intended to be a loosely organized but supportive group for members sharing a problem or concern, or does it need to be laser focused on getting a job done by deadline? Secondly, think about who you want to have as members. If you have a specific task to accomplish, what skills will be required, and who has the needed skills? If you are hoping to address a social problem, who else might be interested in working with you? If the group will be more supportive in nature, what is the population you want to bring into the fold? Also, consider what might be the optimal size for your group. For most task-oriented groups, 6 – 12 is a workable number. Smaller groups can be effective as well, however if you have only 3 – 4 members, absences can render your group temporarily ineffective. Larger groups can also work, however they tend to require more formal organization and leadership, and it may be more difficult to harness individual creativity and foster group cohesion in a larger group. Larger groups are also more prone to forming unintended subgroups, which can promote conflict, so consider whether you really need or want a large group for your project. Bigger is not necessarily better. Once you have an appropriately sized group of the right people devoted to a common cause or purpose, you are ready to begin. Set up your meeting time and place, and get to work! The forming stage is the first stage of group development. This stage encompasses the first and possibly several early meetings, as group members get to know each other, exchange information and ideas, and make early decisions about how they will proceed. Usually everyone is on their best behavior at the beginning. Members are checking each other out, forming opinions about the nature of the group and what their place in it may be, and trying to make a good first impression. Early group meetings tend to be cordial and to run fairly smoothly. The important work at this stage consists of forming early relationships, delineating why you are there, and deciding how you will move forward as a group. While this stage may be pleasant, you don’t want to stay here indefinitely. If a group stalls here, it may be a signal that members don’t feel comfortable, or that there is conflict brewing that is not coming out into the open. It may also indicate that members are not strongly attached to the group’s purpose. The second stage of group development–storming–involves conflict. It is at this stage that disagreements and personality conflicts start to appear, and competition for control of certain group functions arises. If you have done a good job of selecting your group members, their common purpose will help them get past this stage and move on to productive work. If not, the conflict may be more protracted. During this stage the group needs to learn how to manage their differences and cooperate towards common goals. Problems can develop if there is serious disagreement around the group’s purpose, if power struggles go unresolved, or if a single bully or a powerful subgroup sets out to impose their will on others.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:342a6bd4-f513-4985-ac71-95113bf5a3e7>"]},{"passage":"I then went back to Moodle to manually create the groups using such group naming conventions as animal names or comic book titles (Alpacas, The Defenders, etc. ), making the assignments based on my spreadsheet. It took time to ensure that group members hadn’t previously worked together (though this was almost impossible by the last couple of projects). This mixed solution had the added benefit of helping me sometimes find “better” fits for some group members whom I thought would benefit more by working with other students in particular. Overall, I thought working with new people mimicked how real world jobs work. We typically don’t get to choose who our team members are and so learning how to navigate such group politics and issues while working towards a common goal is invaluable. Also, it continually helped teach the valuing of assessing people’s skills and knowledge at the outset and applying that information to the project at hand. And perhaps more importantly in terms of college, it helped connect people who otherwise may have never had the opportunity of meeting one another. One of the most rewarding things about such a class is receiving an email from a former student who happens to mention still being in contact with former group-mates. So what makes a good group size? I’ve tried from 2 to 6 members early on. 2 member groups are too small–if one person was sick or decided to drop the course or just plain wasn’t working, that meant that the other person had to bear the responsibility for the entire project alone. 5 and 6 member groups are too large–mainly from a logistic perspective; that is, although I made some class time available for the groups to work on their projects, the majority of the work was done outside the classroom; accomodating that many different class and work schedules can be very difficult. I found that 3-4 people sized groups is the sweet spot (though depending on the project, even 4 can be a little too much to divide the responsibilities). This allowed groups to recover from for the absence of a member, added the brainstorming power of divergent perspectives, and perhaps more importantly, an provided the opportunity for an equitable division of labor. As I mentioned, most group work was done outside of the classroom. To get groups to thinking about potential challenges, we discussed the pros and cons of face-to-face meetings as well as synchronous and asynchronous technological tools (email, texting, video conferencing, phone calls, etc). Some groups always met face-to-face (like at the library), and some groups tried using only email. The most seemingly productive groups tended to use a combination of face-to-face meetings and distance communication tools. These groups typically began with a face-t0-face meeting, brainstorming on a project goal and developing a temporary plan and schedule. They would use this plan to set up dates\/times and methods of communication. I also I created Moodle forums for each group that were only visible to their members. However, almost no groups ever used them (and even then, only initially), though this did vary from semester to semester. For assignments, I required that in addition to one hard-copy being turned in, each group member uploaded digital files to Moodle. They had to turn in the same copy; I had each member turn in a separate copy for accounting reasons. Although Moodle lets you filter the class by groups on its grading page, I want to be sure I was working with the correct people–and, it also was another way to encourage member participation by making their accountability very visible (if they were not doing the work, it would be highly unlikely that the other members would share their files). About those “Digital files”: since Microsoft Office was freely available on campus computers in the library and various labs, and since I also have my own copy of that produce, I stipulated that the file formats had to be in one of the Office file formats (such as .docx) or .rtf (rich text format). But I did not want to limit students to a particular software package, so I also allowed for any program that could save or print to a .pdf file. And in the case where some projects were more of a physical nature (the Packaging project, for example), they could take digital pictures and upload those to Moodle. Typically, most projects were created digitally, but I also felt it was helpful to see hard copy manifestations of it (again, such as the Packaging Project). This also meant that I did not teach any particular program, although I would demonstrate useful tips and tricks within Word or other tools.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:13974a23-5853-426c-983d-f8bd026b4fe5>"]},{"passage":"Admittedly, the second half sentence “why we should communicate less” is provocative in the modern world of work, but true. But more about that later …\nBy the very hear-worth Podcast “Führungs auf den Punkt gebracht” by leadership coach Bernd Geropp a topic came to me, over which I wanted to blog for a long time: The ideal team size and the dangerously rising communication effort with too large teams. The magic number 7\nIn the Episode 165 of the podcast Bernd Geropp describes the ideal leadership span, i.e. the number of people that can be meaningfully led by a manager. The findings can be applied thereby not only to high-level personnel, but also and particularly with self-leading agile teams. He mentions an article of Professor Dr. Wolfgang Grunwald, work and industrial psychologist. It is shown that groups in the cultural history always consist of approx. 7 humans and larger groups inevitably fall into smaller groups. (For further background information I recommend the podcast or a Google search for the article “Psychologische Gesetzmäßigkeiten der Gruppenarbeit” [Psychological laws of group work].) I found the article and podcast so interesting because it’s more than 20 years old, but picks up on things I first learned in agile teams and UX:\nHick’s law and the magic 7\nIn UX we often speak of Hick’s Law. It describes the relationship between response time and number of choices. In short: With the number of options our reaction time increases. With about 7 options the reaction time is more than one second. This time can only be reduced by training. With UX and web designers the rule of thumb has established itself, never to offer more than 7 options e.g. in the main menu or to display at the same time. Brooks’s Law and the communication paths\nBrook’s Law by the American computer pioneer Fred Brooks states that adding more people to a delayed software project will increase the implementation time, not decrease it. [pullquote align=”right” cite=”Fred Brooks” tweet=”true”]adding human resources to a late software project makes it later[\/pullquote]\nIn addition to the difficult induction and the complex special tasks involved in software development, this is also due to the higher communication effort within the team. The non-linear growth of communication paths according to team size\nIn addition to the formula behind Hick’s Law, another formula is interesting. It describes the possible lines of communication of people, if everyone would have to coordinate with everyone:\nn × (n-1) \/ 2\nCommunication does not increase linearly with the number of people:\n- For 2 persons it is 1 connection\n- For 3 persons there are 3 connections\n- For 4 persons there are 6 connections\n- For 10 persons there are already 45 connections! (Very impressive in this context also this graphic from Stackoverflow.) If we now take our rule of thumb discovered in Hick’s Law, we have a manageable amount of communication lines somewhere with 5-7 people, depending on how many active\/extroverted participants there are. Small anecdote: I recently participated in a workshop with about 35 participants. What do you think: how many possible communication channels would that have been? I’ll tell you: 595. Agile teams and methods of communication avoidance\nCommunication avoidance sounds absurd at first. We are an agile team, we do dailies, we have product owners who manage stakeholders, we have extensive retrospectives. We should avoid communication? Yes! We’re already doing it!

Manual adaptations can sometimes help to balance groups, but in some cases it is impossible to make all to be validated. Then save a partially optimal composition or possibly test another composition with less restrictive criteria. Revision as of 23:36, 7 June 2019\nDo you dream of composing groups on the basis of criteria, such as gathering students on the basis of their preference for work topics or mixing students according to their orientation ? The TeamUp activity allows the teacher to define a questionnaire and to compose groups, taking into account student responses. The TeamUp activity first enables you to compose a questionnaire with multiple choice questions with possibility of restrictions on the answers .For example, it is possible to require the student to tick exactly 2 options from the list of available options. The questionnaire is available to students on the opening date and they can respond to it. As soon as the closing date has passed, the teacher can start the group composition using four approaches :\n- group similar individuals;\n- disperse similar individuals;\n- avoid minorities ;\n- balance the skill level (based on a question with numerical options). Several criteria can be combined to compose the groups and the tool provides a diagnosis on the number of optimal groups. - 1 Create a TeamUp activity\n- 2 Create a questionnaire with distribution criteria\n- 3 Publish the questionnaire and collect student responses\n- 4 Generate groups\n- 5 Perfect repartition is not always possible\nCreate a TeamUp activity\n- a name and an introduction to the activity to present this activity;\n- an opening date from which students will be able to answer the questionnaire (as a result, the questions then can not be modified when this date is passed);\n- a closing date from which student responses will no longer be allowed;\n- the parameter \"Allow updating of answers\" specifies whether you allow students to modify their answers during the opening period of the questionnaire;\nCreate a questionnaire with distribution criteria\nGo to the Questionnaire tab to build the multiple-choice questions that will allow students to provide useful information for group composition. Type your question and define the associated restrictions on the possible answers :\n- none : the student can select any number of options, or none at all;\n- at least one check mark : the student must select at least one option;\n- exactly 1 check mark : the student must select one and only one option;\n- exactly 2 check marks : the student must select exactly 2 options;\n- exactly 3 check marks : the student must select exactly 3 options. When your questionnaire is finalized, you can preview it via the Preview Questions tab . For example, your questions may include the time range for student availability for group meetings (to group them), their curriculum (to mix), their gender (to avoid minorities), their preference thematic (to group them), on their average score over the past year exam (to balance the level of the groups), ... If you want your students to select several options from a list, for example to choose a discussions theme, we advise you to avoid questions that require you to make hierarchical choices (first choice, second choice, ... ). This type of question has two disadvantages :\n- we can not prevent a student from making the same choice 3 times and the algorithm can only attribute this choice to him;\n- the criteria based on hierarchical choices are very restrictive for the distribution algorithm, so that optimal groups are difficult to obtain and, therefore, an unfair distribution for the students. Publish the questionnaire and collect student responses\nWhen your questionnaire is ready, you can change its opening date to make it accessible to students. Do not hesitate to invite your students to answer the questionnaire by using the Moodle Annoucements. You will be able to observe the answers evolution via the Compose groups tab : the students who answered are shown in blue while the students who have not yet responded are displayed in red . If some students do not answer the questionnaire, it do not block the groups composition. They are then randomly placed to complete the groups and you can also move them manually.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:b7547913-b9d3-45cd-a542-4dd476d41409>"]},{"passage":"Security, Group Size, and the Human Brain\nIf the size of your company grows past 150 people, it’s time to get name badges. It’s not that larger groups are somehow less secure, it’s just that 150 is the cognitive limit to the number of people a human brain can maintain a coherent social relationship with. Primatologist Robin Dunbar derived this number by comparing neocortex — the “thinking” part of the mammalian brain — volume with the size of primate social groups. By analyzing data from 38 primate genera and extrapolating to the human neocortex size, he predicted a human “mean group size” of roughly 150. This number appears regularly in human society; it’s the estimated size of a Neolithic farming village, the size at which Hittite settlements split, and the basic unit in professional armies from Roman times to the present day. Larger group sizes aren’t as stable because their members don’t know each other well enough. Instead of thinking of the members as people, we think of them as groups of people. For such groups to function well, they need externally imposed structure, such as name badges. Of course, badges aren’t the only way to determine in-group\/out-group status. Other markers include insignia, uniforms, and secret handshakes. They have different security properties and some make more sense than others at different levels of technology, but once a group reaches 150 people, it has to do something. More generally, there are several layers of natural human group size that increase with a ratio of approximately three: 5, 15, 50, 150, 500, and 1500 — although, really, the numbers aren’t as precise as all that, and groups that are less focused on survival tend to be smaller. The layers relate to both the intensity and intimacy of relationship and the frequency of contact. The smallest, three to five, is a “clique”: the number of people from whom you would seek help in times of severe emotional distress. The twelve to 20 group is the “sympathy group”: people with which you have special ties. After that, 30 to 50 is the typical size of hunter-gatherer overnight camps, generally drawn from the same pool of 150 people. No matter what size company you work for, there are only about 150 people you consider to be “co-workers.” (In small companies, Alice and Bob handle accounting. In larger companies, it’s the accounting department — and maybe you know someone there personally.) The 500-person group is the “megaband,” and the 1,500-person group is the “tribe.” Fifteen hundred is roughly the number of faces we can put names to, and the typical size of a hunter-gatherer society. These numbers are reflected in military organization throughout history: squads of 10 to 15 organized into platoons of three to four squads, organized into companies of three to four platoons, organized into battalions of three to four companies, organized into regiments of three to four battalions, organized into divisions of two to three regiments, and organized into corps of two to three divisions. Coherence can become a real problem once organizations get above about 150 in size. So as group sizes grow across these boundaries, they have more externally imposed infrastructure — and more formalized security systems. In intimate groups, pretty much all security is ad hoc. Companies smaller than 150 don’t bother with name badges; companies greater than 500 hire a guard to sit in the lobby and check badges. The military have had centuries of experience with this under rather trying circumstances, but even there the real commitment and bonding invariably occurs at the company level. Above that you need to have rank imposed by discipline. The whole brain-size comparison might be bunk, and a lot of evolutionary psychologists disagree with it. But certainly security systems become more formalized as groups grow larger and their members less known to each other. When do more formal dispute resolution systems arise: town elders, magistrates, judges? At what size boundary are formal authentication schemes required? Small companies can get by without the internal forms, memos, and procedures that large companies require; when does what tend to appear? How does punishment formalize as group size increase? And how do all these things affect group coherence? People act differently on social networking sites like Facebook when their list of “friends” grows larger and less intimate.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:665b930c-8f12-4762-9d6a-71bb33173374>"]},{"passage":"I’ve mentioned in several blog entries that I am a member of a Mastermind Group, and people often ask me a variety of questions about how my meeting is structured and run. Since I think Mastermind Groups are a wonderful tool for personal growth and connection, I’d like to share some of the details about how my group works which will help you form and run your own group. In essence, a Mastermind Group is a group that helps you become a vibrational match for your goals or your intentions. The belief is that your group members know you so well, they can tell when you are not really a vibrational match for your desire, so they will help you locate blocks or help you craft an intention that is in alignment with who you are and what you want. How many people are in the group? My group has 6 members. Sometimes someone takes a break for a few months if their schedule gets too full, if they’re traveling, or if they just need a break. Sometimes a member will bring a guest to a meeting to see if they are a good fit for the group. We generally have the guest come to a few meetings so we can get a feel for her and for her to decide if joining our group is something she’s really interested in. But generally speaking, we keep the number at 6 or 7. The number of people in the Mastermind is really up to each group, but I think 5-7 people is ideal. If the group is too big you can sometimes lose the intimate connection as people split into cliques or sub groups. Or your meetings can take 2 hours. If the group is too small you don’t get the wisdom of a larger collective, and if people are absent you could be at your meeting with just one other person. How often do you meet? My group meets every other week. Even if someone can’t make the meeting, we don’t try to find a day when everyone can make it. We stick to our schedule and whoever can come, comes. Most of the time, every member is present. It works best that way if the members are committed to attending every meeting. I think meeting once a month is not quite enough because a lot can happen in a month and if you miss even one meeting then you’re really going long without your supportive group. Meeting weekly is also a good option if everyone is comfortable meeting that often. How long are your meetings? We meet for one hour, however we have learned to reserve some time after our meeting for chatting about other things going on in our lives. During the meeting, we are all business, otherwise it’s easy to get sidetracked. Sometimes a member is going through a personal crisis, but we honor our meeting structure and then spend time after the meeting helping her with practical solutions to her problem. Is your group for women only? We tested out having men in our group but decided it changed the energy and dynamic too much, so now we’re a woman-only group. You can specify a gender or invite anyone. It all depends on what kind of energy you want to create and how compatible everyone is with each other. Compatible energy is more important than gender. Where do you meet? Our group meets at the home of one of our members. You can meet in a conference room, a park, a restaurant, or really anywhere that you can ensure privacy, because you need to be able to be emotionally intimate with your members. You can rotate the home in which you have your meetings to make it fair for everyone. How do you find members? Adding new members to my group usually happens when one of us brings a friend who we think would be interested in joining and also be a good fit for our other members. I think it’s vital that you don’t add new members if someone who is already in the group opposes the addition of a new member for whatever reason. There is a great deal of trust involved in having a Mastermind Group and if someone would feel uncomfortable with the addition of another member then it’s not worth adding the new person. If you’re just starting out, I recommend picking people who share a similar vibration to you. Perhaps a close friend. But just because someone is your friend doesn’t mean they will be a good member of a Mastermind Group. To function well, members should be emotionally mature, respect confidential personal information you may discuss at meetings, be reasonably intelligent, and kind. Pick other attributes as best suits your group’s intention (i.e. business minded, other parents, women only, etc.). What happens at the meetings themselves? We start our meetings by reading our Declarations For Mastermind which is simply a list of our group’s goals and guidelines.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:1d39addb-a557-46b4-8dfd-8c87ec1567f6>"]},{"passage":"Groups are extremely buzzword compliant.

This process can be used for three purposes:\n- Create a list of duties for a job. - Create a list of tasks needed to perform each duty. - Identifying the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed for each task. Here’s how the process works:\n- Gather a group of “experts” for a particular job. - Have each expert make their own list of that they believe the duties to be. - Starting with one person, have him\/her read out loud one of the identified duties. - Others in the group will likely have that duty, as well. - As a group, decide if it is a duty or a task that fits into a larger duty. - If others have that duty on their list, come to consensus on the best wording for the duty. - Write the duty in large letters on an 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper, and tape it to the wall. - Everyone crosses that duty off their list. - Move on to the next person, have him\/her read off another duty. Repeat step 4. - Continue around the room until everyone has provided a duty, then start over with the first person again and keep going around the room until everyone’s list is exhausted. - There should be between five and fourteen duties on the wall. If more than fourteen exist, look at how some of the duties could be combined so that no more than fourteen exist. - If there are less than five, it may be that some duties have been defined too broadly. Consider which ones may be too comprehensive and break them down, if needed. - Prioritize the duties by starting with three groups:\n- Which are the highest priority duties? Move those to one side of the wall. - Which are the lowest priority duties? Move those to the other side of the wall. - Now that three groups exist, prioritize the duties in each group. This gives you an overall priority list. - Take each duty and repeat the Nominal Group Technique to determine each set of tasks. Instead of prioritizing each completed list, order them for optimal efficiency to perform the duty. Repeat the process, but take each task and brainstorm the necessary knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed to accomplish each task. Instead of prioritizing the KSA’s place them in the most appropriate order for people to learn how to perform each task.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e9ccfd01-7f73-4830-8dd4-5e46b61a4300>"]},{"passage":"Another issue of an occasional series—Dear Adrian—in which I answer questions about event design, elementary particle physics, solar hot water systems, facilitation, and anything else I might conceivably know something about. If you have a question you’d like me to answer, please contact me (don’t worry, I won’t publish anything without your permission). Here’s a great question from Australian facilitator, trainer, and coach Steve Rohan-Jones about … The Three Questions! (Check out the link if you aren’t already familiar with The Three Questions, otherwise what you are about to read won’t make much sense.) Good morning from Canberra, Adrian,\nI have just read through The Power of Participation over one year after I received a signed copy from you! In short, I have a question about The Three Questions. I understand the process both in singular and multiple form (combined with round tables). From my reading, The Three Questions appears to take some time (based on the amount of participants) with only one person speaking. This appears at odds with the aim to get people engaged in conversation. I would also think – not a question just an observation – that group of 6 would be better. This would speed up the set piece of one person speaking and others listening, reduce the need for breaks and keep the energy going early in the day. Can you clarify my understanding of The Three Questions? I look forward to hearing from you. O2C Pty Ltd\nSteve, I like your question because it highlights a key tension inherent in group process design: the tension between intimacy (going deep with a few) and discovery (uncovering the possibilities of the many). Let’s explore this in more detail. When people are meeting for a shared purpose, some of the potentially valuable outcomes include:\n- Learning about each other. - Being and feeling heard. - Sharing with each other. - Learning from each other. The Three Questions focuses on #1, #2, and #3. I love to use it at the start of an event or workshop, because we can’t really learn effectively from our peers (#4) until we:\n- have learnt what they might have to offer (#1);\n- feel safe sharing with them (#2); and\n- have each had an opportunity to share our own expertise and experience (#3). Because each person gets the same amount of time to share their answers to The Three Questions to a group, the time needed to run the process is proportional to the group’s size. [I’m neglecting here the few minutes needed to a) explain the process and b) provide one or two short breaks for large groups.] In practice, I’ve found this restricts the maximum effective size of a single group using The Three Questions to 60 people. If more than 60 people are present, you divide them into smaller groups and run multiple simultaneous The Three Questions sessions. Even if we have 60 people or less, we may still decide to divide our group into several smaller groups and run multiple simultaneous sessions. Typically we’ll do this when time is a constraint. For example, next month I’m leading a two-hour, ~200 person, participation techniques workshop. In order to cover multiple core techniques in two hours with this many participants, I will give them just a taste of The Three Questions by running 30+ concurrent 6-person groups. Everyone will know five former strangers much better after the ~20 minute session is over, but they won’t have learned more about the others in the room. So when designing a session or conference that includes The Three Questions, there is a trade-off between the time we have or want to allocate and group size, because we need to give each person sufficient time for meaningful sharing with their group (typically 1 – 2 minutes per person). There’s no single answer for this design decision that’s optimum for all circumstances. At a multi-day conference, for example, it makes sense to run multiple simultaneous 50-60 person Three Questions groups for a couple of hours at the start of the event. Everyone in each group will learn important information about the interests and resources of their 50-60 peers. For a monthly board meeting, once a year I might run a single session with the ten board members to remind the group of each member’s “why?”. And at a one-day peer conference with ninety participants, perhaps three simultaneous 30-person sessions would be the way to go. In some ways this design consideration is a parallel application of Jerry Weinberg’s Law of Raspberry Jam:\nThe wider you spread it, the thinner it gets.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:3a372d4c-14cc-4c24-822c-59b5c99768e2>"]}]}

Scroll down to find out what time do refunds go into bank accounts and what are your legal rights as a consumer when it comes to getting money back from online merchants. The amount of time it takes for a refund to be processed in the UK depends on several factors, including the payment method, the merchant and your bank. You are refunded in the same way you paid for the item or service. In other words, if you paid in cash, you will receive a gift card or a voucher. If you paid by direct debit, credit or debit card, the money will be refunded into your bank account in three to five working days. However, refunds on purchases made by debit card take seven to 10 business days, whereas for credit cards, the timeframe is three to seven days. Did you know: Internet retail sales grew by 72.7% during the pandemic? Occasionally, it can take longer. That said, if your refund is not showing up in your bank account within 14 working days, you should contact your bank or credit provider. Processing refunds to debit cards take longer because the vendor must first approve the refund. If your request is approved, the merchant will issue a refund to the card used for the transaction, but only after they receive the money in their account. This can take a couple of days. After your bank or building society gets the money from the vendor, they’ll credit the refund, which may also take several business days. Looking for the best debit card for your child?

Amazon, the biggest online retailer, immediately processes requests for credit, debit card and bank refunds in the UK, with the funds being available in your account within 14 days. The refund will be shown in your account or credit card statement no later than seven days after the refund was approved. If available, you could also opt for an Instant Refund and have the funds transferred within hours, either on your credit card or in the form of free Amazon Gift Cards (depending on the type you choose). The average debit card refund time in the UK for eBay customers is two business days after the item has been returned to the seller. Your refund will be sent to your original payment method and available between three and five working days (depending on the bank)\nWorth noting: if the seller has not responded to your refund request in three days, eBay might be required to step in to help. In this case, funds will be transferred about three weeks from the time your refund request was sent. It takes three to five business days for a refund to appear on your credit card statement (if you purchased by credit card on Etsy), although in some cases, it could take up to 30 working days. If you used PayPal for a purchase, your refunds would be sent back through the original payment method. The refund on your Paypal account balance will show up the same day and on your bank account for up to five days. Refunds to debit cards or credit cards, on the other hand, may take up to 30 days, depending on your card issuer. Worth noting: If you are using another BNPL service, you should take a look at their refund and return policy before signing up, as not all of them are regulated and adhere to Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act.

You could purchase something that turns out to be defective or simply change your mind about the item. Regardless of the circumstances, you should be able to seek out a credit card refund from the merchant. It’s a relatively easy process that credits your account the purchase amount of the item. What is a credit card refund? When you make a purchase on a credit card then request a refund for that purchase, you won’t be able to receive cash. Instead, you’ll receive a credit on your account that is equal to the amount of the original purchase. The process usually begins after the merchant agrees to refund you for the item. If the merchant refuses to or is unable to, however, then you may be able to rely on return protection instead. Consult with your credit card issuer for information on whether your situation meets the requirements to enact the protection policy. How does a credit card refund work? To fully understand how refunds are granted to your credit card account, it’s important to know how the transactions are actually processed. When you make a purchase with a credit card, your credit card company is who pays the merchant. The available credit on your account goes down after your card issuer approves the transaction. Then, you pay them back for the purchase when you make payments to your account. Credit card networks are the companies that process the transactions between your credit card issuer and the merchants where you make purchases. So, the merchant has to send your refund back to your credit card issuer before they can credit your account for the purchase. That is why credit card refunds often take several days to process, and you can only receive a refund in the original payment method. If you are making a return in-store, the merchant can sometimes pull your card details from the receipt; otherwise, you will need to have the same card with you. As well, your card issuer may not refund any foreign transaction fees because it costs them money to process an international purchase, so consult with them to know for sure. How long does a credit card refund take? Since return transactions have to go through the credit card networks, it often takes several days to see the credit returned to your account. The exact time can vary depending on your return method, the card issuer and the merchant. If you have returned the item in person, some merchants can credit your account quickly, but generally, it will take five to 14 business days. Additionally, if the return isn’t processed by your card’s closing date, it won’t appear on that month’s statement. If you have mailed your return, you will also have to take shipping time into account. The best way to get an idea of how long a refund will take is to find more information on the merchant’s website. If you would prefer the refund to happen immediately, you can ask for store credit instead, but the purchase balance would then stay on your account. What’s the difference between a credit card refund and a chargeback? A credit card refund occurs after you make a purchase and then have the purchase amount credited back to your account. A chargeback, on the other hand, reverses the original charge and can only occur after you have filed a billing dispute with your credit card company. You may file a billing dispute within 60 days for something you didn’t purchase or something you purchased and never received. A current example may be getting a chargeback for an event that was canceled due to COVID-19. The refund process, unless you are enacting your card issuer’s return protection, is initiated by the merchant, while a chargeback is initiated by your credit card company. A chargeback can also take much longer because your card company has 90 days to resolve the issue and up to 150 days to complete the charge reverse process. Credit card refunds: FAQ\nDo credit card refunds affect your credit? A credit card refund may boost your credit score if it reduces your account’s credit utilization ratio. Using 30 percent or less of your card’s total credit limit will help avoid any negative impact on your credit score. The purchase amount of a returned item that hasn’t yet been processed and pushes your credit utilization above 30 percent may harm your score until the refund is complete.

Consult with your credit card issuer for information on whether your situation meets the requirements to enact the protection policy. How does a credit card refund work? To fully understand how refunds are granted to your credit card account, it’s important to know how the transactions are actually processed. When you make a purchase with a credit card, your credit card company is who pays the merchant. The available credit on your account goes down after your card issuer approves the transaction. Then, you pay them back for the purchase when you make payments to your account. Credit card networks are the companies that process the transactions between your credit card issuer and the merchants where you make purchases. So, the merchant has to send your refund back to your credit card issuer before they can credit your account for the purchase. That is why credit card refunds often take several days to process, and you can only receive a refund in the original payment method. If you are making a return in-store, the merchant can sometimes pull your card details from the receipt; otherwise, you will need to have the same card with you. As well, your card issuer may not refund any foreign transaction fees because it costs them money to process an international purchase, so consult with them to know for sure. How long does a credit card refund take? Since return transactions have to go through the credit card networks, it often takes several days to see the credit returned to your account. The exact time can vary depending on your return method, the card issuer and the merchant. If you have returned the item in person, some merchants can credit your account quickly, but generally, it will take five to 14 business days. Additionally, if the return isn’t processed by your card’s closing date, it won’t appear on that month’s statement. If you have mailed your return, you will also have to take shipping time into account. The best way to get an idea of how long a refund will take is to find more information on the merchant’s website. If you would prefer the refund to happen immediately, you can ask for store credit instead, but the purchase balance would then stay on your account. What’s the difference between a credit card refund and a chargeback? A credit card refund occurs after you make a purchase and then have the purchase amount credited back to your account. A chargeback, on the other hand, reverses the original charge and can only occur after you have filed a billing dispute with your credit card company. You may file a billing dispute within 60 days for something you didn’t purchase or something you purchased and never received. A current example may be getting a chargeback for an event that was canceled due to COVID-19. The refund process, unless you are enacting your card issuer’s return protection, is initiated by the merchant, while a chargeback is initiated by your credit card company. A chargeback can also take much longer because your card company has 90 days to resolve the issue and up to 150 days to complete the charge reverse process. Credit card refunds: FAQ\nDo credit card refunds affect your credit? A credit card refund may boost your credit score if it reduces your account’s credit utilization ratio. Using 30 percent or less of your card’s total credit limit will help avoid any negative impact on your credit score. The purchase amount of a returned item that hasn’t yet been processed and pushes your credit utilization above 30 percent may harm your score until the refund is complete.

In order to enhance the classification to the more serious version for a second OWI, the prior conviction or related charge must have occurred within the last 12 years from the date of the new offense. Any OWI conviction or deferred judgment during that time period counts. Even convictions that occurred outside of the State of Iowa count. The penalties for a second OWI also vary slightly depending on whether the case involves a chemical test of the breath, blood or urine, or a refusal to submit to the test. Other consequences of a second or subsequent OWI arrest in Des Moines, Iowa, includes the fact that an officer can immediately impound the driver’s vehicle. A second conviction for OWI can result in at the seizure and forfeiture of the vehicle.

Second OWI Information Center\n- Penalties for a Second OWI in Iowa\n- What Counts as a Second OWI Conviction in Iowa\n- Finding an Iowa Attorney for a Second OWI\nThe laws in Iowa provide for the following penalties and punishments for a second OWI:\n- Incarceration Time: The law provides for a minimum jail sentence of 7 days in county jail that must be served on consecutive days. The 7 day sentence is a minimum mandatory penalties meaning that the judge can not suspended this requirement. The maximum jail sentence is up to 24 months in the county jail. Under limited circumstances the court may order the person to serve the minimum sentence in 48 hour segments if the jail sentences creates an undo hardship or if there is not sufficient space in the jail. - Fines: The minimum fines are $1,875 and the maximum fines are $6,250. The court is able to order community service hours to be performed instead of the fine amount. - Suspension: For a second OWI, the court must impose a driver's license revocation for 2-years. During that time, the driver is not eligible for a temporary restricted license during the first year. Prior to reinstatement, the driver must obtain SR22 showing proof of financial responsibility, the ignition interlock must be installed, and the driver must by a $200 civil penalty. - Substance Abuse Treatment: After a conviction, the driver is required to complete a substance abuse evaluation and recommended follow up treatment. - Driver’s license revocation:\n- Chemical Test: If the individual took the chemical test and had a BAC over .08 then the revocation is for one year with a one year hard suspension. - Work Permit: The hard suspension refers to the time during which no work permit is allowed. Additionally, if the person is convicted of a second OWI, then the individual must install the ignition interlock device (IID) before the driver’s license is reinstated. - Refusal: If the individual refused the test then the revocation is for two years with a one year hard suspension. - Work Permit: The hard suspension refers to the time during which no work permit is allowed. Additionally, the ignition interlock device must be installed before the individual is eligible for the work permit. - Treatment; In addition to the minimum mandatory penalties, for a second OWI conviction the court can require the person to undergo inpatient treatment for alcoholism or drug addiction. The time that the person spends in the inpatient treatment shall be credited against the defendant's sentence. The degree or severity of a particular OWI offense is determined by the number of OWI convictions that occurred within the previous 12 years. Iowa Code § 321.12(4). The \"look-back\" provision for determining if this offense is a second OWI is by looking at the period from the date of the oldest conviction to the date of the most current arrest. State v. Raim, 381 N.W.2d 635, 637-638 (Iowa 1986).\n\n1. a. The commissioner of public safety, the director of transportation, and the director of natural resources, acting jointly, shall adopt a uniform, combined citation and complaint which shall be used for charging all traffic violations in Iowa under state law or local regulation or ordinance, and which shall be used for charging all other violations which are designated by section 805.8 to be scheduled violations. The filing fees and court costs in cases of parking meter and overtime parking violations which are denied are as stated in section 602.8106, subsection 1. The court costs in scheduled violation cases where a court appearance is not required are as stated in section 602.8106, subsection 1. The court costs in scheduled violation cases where a court appearance is required are as stated in section 602.8106, subsection 1. This subsection does not prevent the charging of any of those violations by information, by private complaint filed under chapter 804, or by a simple notice of fine where permitted by section 321.236, subsection 1. Each uniform citation and complaint shall be serially numbered and shall be in quintuplicate, and the officer shall deliver the original and a copy to the court where the defendant is to appear, two copies to the defendant, and a copy to the law enforcement agency of the officer. The court shall forward an abstract of the uniform citation and complaint in accordance with section 321.491 when applicable. The uniform citation and complaint shall contain spaces for the parties' names; the address of the alleged offender; the registration number of the offender's vehicle; the information required by section 805.2, a warning which states, \"I hereby swear and affirm that the information provided by me on this citation is true under penalty of providing false information\"; and a statement that providing false information is a violation of section 719.3; a list of the scheduled fines prescribed by section 805.8, either separately or by group, and a statement of the court costs payable in scheduled violation cases, whether or not a court appearance is required or is demanded; a brief explanation of sections 805.9 and 805.10; and a space where the defendant may sign an admission of the violation when permitted by section 805.9; and the uniform citation and complaint shall require that the defendant appear before a court at a specified time and place. The uniform citation and complaint also may contain a space for the imprint of a credit card, and may contain any other information which the commissioner of public safety and the director of natural resources may determine. Notwithstanding other contrary requirements of this section, a uniform citation and complaint may be originated from a computerized device. The officer issuing the citation through a computerized device shall obtain electronically the signature of the person cited as provided in section 805.3 and shall give two copies of the citation to the person cited and shall provide a record of the citation to the court where the person cited is to appear and to the law enforcement agency of the officer by an electronic process which accurately reproduces or forms a durable medium for accurately and legibly reproducing an unaltered image or copy of the citation. b. The uniform citation and complaint shall contain the following:\n(1) A promise to appear as provided in section 805.3. (2) The following statement: Q $KIP$ 1\nI hereby give my unsecured appearance bond in the amount of $DTL4@ dollars and enter my written appearance. I agree that if I fail to appear in person or by counsel to defend against the offense charged in this citation the court is authorized to enter a conviction and render judgment against me for the amount of my appearance bond in satisfaction of the penalty plus court costs. Q $KIP$ 1\n(3) A space immediately below the items in subparagraphs (1) and (2) for the signature of the person being charged which shall serve for each of the items in subparagraphs (1) and (2). c.

Operating While Intoxicated is often referred to as an OWI, DUI or DWI. Under Iowa law, set out in Iowa Code section 321J.2, a conviction for an Operating While Intoxicated offense results when the prosecution is able to prove each of the necessary elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Those elements are listed below. The defendant operated a motor vehicle; AND\nAt the time of operation, the defendant was:\n- Under the influence of alcohol and\/or drug; or\n- Had an alcohol concentration in excess of .08; or\n- Had “any” amount of controlled substance present in their system. Under the Influence\nA person is legally “under the influence” of alcohol or a drug when any one of the following is true as a result of consumption of alcohol or use of a drug:\n- The person’s emotions are visibly excited;\n- The person’s judgment is impaired;\n- The person has lost control of their bodily actions or movements to any extent; or\n- The person’s mental ability has been affected. “Any amount” of controlled substance means just that; “any amount.” Thus, if a controlled substance is detected in a person’s system at or near the time they were operating a motor vehicle, they can be charged and potentially convicted of operating while intoxicated even if they were not even necessarily “impaired” by that substance. Determining Which Offense Current Charge is: First, Second or Third Offense\nOnly prior criminal convictions are counted to determine if a criminal charge is a First OWI, Second OWI or Third OWI offense. Prior license suspensions may be considered by sentencing judges but cannot form the basis for an enhancement of the pending criminal charge. How far back are drunk driving convictions considered? Iowa has a twelve (12) year “look back period” which is used to determine whether the current charge is a 1st OWI, 2nd OWI or 3rd OWI offense. The clock runs from the date of sentencing on the prior conviction to the date of the alleged current charge. Example: Person is arrested for operating while intoxicated on January 1, 2010. He has a prior arrest for operating while intoxicated on November 1, 1997 however he was not sentenced for the first offense until January 15, 1998. While the offense occurred more than 12 years before the pending offense, the person was sentenced for the first offense within 12 years of the new charge thus making the new charge a 2nd offense, an OWI – Second Offense. Third OWI Offenses\nWhen determining whether an offense is a Third OWI offense, the level of prior offense is irrelevant. All that matters is whether the individual has been convicted of any level of operating while intoxicated within the “look back period.” In other words you don’t have to be convicted of a 2nd offense in order for the next charge to be a 3rd offense. Sometimes prosecutors will amend a 2nd offense down to a 1st offense as part of a plea bargain but if that person picks up another charge and has two prior convictions for any level of operating while intoxicated, the new charge will be a 3rd offense. Iowa Minor Drinking & Driving Laws\nThere are two different types of legal problems that can arise for underage individuals that are stopped and investigated for operating while intoxicated. First, they can be charged with any and all operating while intoxicated offenses just as a person over the age of 21 may be charged. In these situations they face the same penalties and same consequences as someone over the age of 21, assuming the person is 18 years of age or older. Second, even if they provide a breath sample below .08 their driving privileges may be disqualified for what is commonly referred to as a “zero tolerance” violation. The “legal limit” for all criminal prosecutions in the State of Iowa for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated is .08. If a person under the age of 21 provides a breath sample in excess of .08 or is otherwise “under the influence” of alcohol, drug or a combination thereof, they will be charged with the normal operating while intoxicated offenses. However, individuals under the age of 21, there is a lower “legal limit” that applies only to license revocation proceedings.\n\n(2) If the violation charged involved or resulted in an accident or injury to property and the total damages are less than five hundred dollars, the amount of fifty dollars plus court costs. (3) If the violation is for any offense for which a court appearance is mandatory, the amount of one hundred dollars plus court costs. d. The written appearance defined in paragraph \"b\" shall not be used for any offense other than a simple misdemeanor. 2. In addition to those violations which are required by subsection 1 to be charged upon a uniform citation and complaint, a violation of chapter 321 which is punishable as a simple, serious, or aggravated misdemeanor may be charged upon a uniform citation and complaint, whether or not the alleged offender is arrested by the officer making the charge. 3. Supplies of the uniform citation and complaint for municipal corporations and county agencies shall be paid for out of the budget of the municipal corporation or county receiving the fine resulting from use of the citation and complaint. Supplies of the uniform citation and complaint form used by other agencies shall be paid for out of the budget of the agency concerned and not out of the budget of the judicial department. 4. The uniform citation and complaint shall contain a place for the verification of the officer issuing the complaint. The complaint may be verified in accordance with section 622.1. 5. The commissioner of public safety and the director of the department of natural resources, acting jointly, shall design and publish a compendium of scheduled violations and scheduled fines, containing other information which they deem appropriate, and shall distribute copies to all courts and law enforcement officers and agencies of the state upon request. The cost of the publication shall be paid out of the budget of the department of public safety and out of the budget of the department of natural resources, each budget being liable for half of those costs. Copies shall be made available to individuals upon request, and a charge may be collected which does not exceed the cost of printing. 6. Supplies of uniform citation and complaint forms existing or on order on July 1, 1995, may be used until exhausted.

Driving under the influence of any substance, legal, or illegal, is unsafe, quite dangerous to you and others, and just plain old bad decision making. Having an OWI on one's driving record is a restricting experience and can cost a driver his privileges, and many times, his job. For most of us, our transportation is essential to our livelihood and our daily family schedules and activities; and with a OWI, we often have to rearrange, not just our lives, but the lives of those around us. Every state may vary slightly in its rules of giving out an OWI, and how they enforce this driving restriction, but if you are a resident of Michigan, you may wonder what having a OWI on your record entails. Here is your answer:\nIn the state of Michigan, “drunk driving” is the label given to anyone driving with a blood alcohol level of 0.08% or higher. If a driver is caught with illegal drugs in their system, such as marijuana, cocaine, or GHB, the prosecution will not legally bear the burden of proving that you were impaired, just simply that you had any of these drugs in your system. Refusing to take a breathalyzer, blood, or urine test, will not help you if you are pulled over in Michigan for driving under the influence. The state has what is called an, “implied consent law,” which means that if you refuse the tests, your driver's license will be automatically suspended for a year, and in addition to any monetary and criminal penalties you receive, six points will be added to your license. For those who are not of the legal drinking age of 21, the law is even stricter for those caught driving under the influence. If a minor is caught with even an unopened container of alcohol while driving or parked in a lot, he or she will be charged with a criminal misdemeanor. If the underage driver has alcohol in their system, of 0.02% or greater, they will be arrested. Drivers can be charged with a list of violations depending upon the situation:\nOperating while visibly impaired (OWVI)\nOperating while intoxicated (OWI)\nOperating a vehicle with any presence of a schedule 1 drug or cocaine (in other words, even if you do not appear impaired, if there is even a trace of any of these drugs in your system, you can be prosecuted). There are various fees that a driver could face after their court hearing; including monetary fines, license suspensions and restrictions, vehicle immobilization, community service, and incarceration. So remember, it is wise, safe, and lawful, to avoid driving if you are under the influence of any substance, legal or illegal. If you have any more questions about your OWI, please contact The Law Office of Joseph F. Awad today!\n\nIf you are driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol while in the state of Wisconsin, it is possible to end up with an OWI charge if a police officer catches you. Frequently called DUIs in other states, an OWI is an official traffic violation for “operating while intoxicated.”\nFacing an OWI can present several challenges. However, understanding the possible OWI consequences can give you a clearer picture of your legal situation and the road ahead. If you have never received an OWI before, the consequences that you face will be less severe. For example, first-time offenders may encounter up to a $300 fine while fines can be anywhere from $25,000 to $50,000 for seventh, eighth or tenth offenses. Driver’s license suspension\nAlthough first-time offenses face lighter punishments, you can still lose your license with even one OWI. For first and second offenses, license suspension can be six to nine months, and additional OWIs can be for two to three years. In some cases, an OWI can cause a lifetime driver’s license revocation. Most first-time OWI cases do not involve jail time unless there is a minor in the situation. However, subsequent offenses can lead to anywhere from five days to 15 years behind bars. Sentencing also varies depending on how many OWIs you have had. With your fourth offense, the charge becomes a felony which can extend the amount of time that the incident remains on your record. OWI charges are serious. You should not delay speaking with a legal representative who can help you better understand your options.\n\n(g) For a Class G felony, a fine not to exceed $25,000 or imprisonment not to exceed 10 years, or both. (h) For a Class H felony, a fine not to exceed $10,000 or imprisonment not to exceed 6 years, or both. (i) For a Class I felony, a fine not to exceed $10,000 or imprisonment not to exceed 3 years and 6 months, or both. Some common Wisconsin Felony Charges include:\n(1) Possession of Controlled Substance\n(2) OWI 4th offense or greater within 5 years of prior offense\n(5) Aggravated Battery to Police Officer\n(7) Identity Theft\n(8) Possession of Stolen Motor Vehicle\nMisdemeanor Charges in Wisconsin\n1) Misdemeanors in chs. 939 - 951 are classified as follows:\n(a) Class A misdemeanor\n(b) Class B misdemeanor\n(c) Class C misdemeanor\n(2) A misdemeanor is a Class A, B or C misdemeanor when it is so specified in chs.939 to 951. (3) Penalties for misdemeanors are as follows:\n(a) For a Class A misdemeanor, a fine not to exceed $10,000 or imprisonment not to exceed 9 months, or both. (b) For a Class B misdemeanor, a fine not to exceed $1,000 or imprisonment not to exceed 90 days, or both. (c) For a Class C misdemeanor, a fine not to exceed $500 or imprisonment not to exceed 30 days, or both.

These offenses are punishable by fine only, but often have serious ancillary consequences such as with Underage Possession or Consumption of Alcohol or OWI 1st. Wisconsin is the only State in the United States in which OWI or DUI is considered a civil forfeiture and not a criminal offense for a first offense. (1) Except as provided in ss. 946.86 and 946.87, forfeitures in chs. 939 to 951 are classified as follows:\n(a) Class A forfeiture\n(b) Class B forfeiture\n(c) Class C forfeiture\n(d) Class D forfeiture\n(e) Class E forfeiture\n(2) A forfeiture is a Class A, B, C, D or E forfeiture when it is so specified in chs. 939 to 951. (3) Penalties for forfeitures are as follows:\n(a) For a Class A forfeiture, a forfeiture not to exceed $10,000. (b) For a Class B forfeiture, a forfeiture not to exceed $1,000. (c) For a Class C forfeiture, a forfeiture not to exceed $500. (d) For a Class D forfeiture, a forfeiture not to exceed $200. (e) For a Class E forfeiture, a forfeiture not to exceed $25.\n\nDUI smackdown: Drunk driving consequences reach far and wide\nOn Sept. 3, 2013, San Francisco opened a seismically safe eastern span of the Bay Bridge. Not two hours later, California Highway Patrol made their first DUI arrest on the bridge. Whether it's called driving under the influence (DUI), operating while intoxicated (OWI) or driving while intoxicated (DWI), drunk driving is a nationwide problem of seismic magnitude. A majority of states use .08 percent as the legal level of intoxication for adults. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), an estimated 10,228 people died in drunk driving crashes in 2011, accounting for 31 percent of all traffic deaths that year. Since NHTSA began recording alcohol-related statistics in 1982, drunk driving fatalities have decreased 52 percent, from 21,113 in 1982, in large part because of public awareness campaigns and tough nationwide laws. Nonetheless, in 2011, Florida's department of motor vehicles alone still recorded 33,625 DUI convictions. \"Drunk driving is incredibly serious,\" says Benjamin Luftman, a DUI attorney at Luftman, Heck & Associates in Columbus, Ohio. \"In Ohio, you can't expunge or seal a conviction of DUI. It's on your record for life.\" And a DUI can haunt every aspect of someone's life, from employment to insurance rates. \"I strongly believe that a DUI conviction can be a bar to employment. I usually explain that if an employer has 10 qualified applicants for a position, does a background check and one of them has a DUI conviction, that person will likely be amongst the first cut. That is especially true in as competitive a job market as we have today,\" says Luftman. Ohio's OVI (operating a vehicle under the influence) penalties are particularly harsh. A first offense gets you a possible three-day jail stint, a 72-hour intervention program (usually held in an area hotel), a three- to six-month license suspension and fines of $375 to $1,075. Blow over .17 on a breathalyzer test and your jail time is mandatory -- and you've bought yourself a specialized bright yellow DUI license plate for your suspension period that lets everyone know you got a DUI. Upon a second offense in Ohio, you get a mandatory ignition interlock, which costs up to $200 for installation and $80 per month maintenance. It uses a breathalyzer system that's connected to the vehicle's engine that's required to start the car and keep it running. If alcohol is detected the car won't start or will disable in motion. Currently 36 states have ignition interlock system laws. Refusing to blow\nSo why not refuse the breathalyzer? Here's why: The majority of states have some type of \"implied consent\" law. \"This means that when you sign up for your driver's license, you also consent to taking a breathalyzer test upon demand from a police officer,\" says Eric Misterovich, a DUI attorney at Newburg Law in St. Joseph, Mich. Many times people refuse a breathalyzer because they don't want to provide evidence of their blood alcohol to police out of fear of being arrested. However, the penalty for refusing the breath test can be harsher than the OWI charge, says Misterovich. \"A first-time OWI charge in Michigan is a misdemeanor punishable by 93 days in jail, $2,500 in various fines, six points on your record and a 30-day license suspension with an additional 150 days of a restricted license,\" he says. The majority of first-time offenders are not sentenced to jail; rather, they are given probation, fines and license restrictions. However, if you refuse to take a breathalyzer or refuse to take a chemical rights test in Michigan (but in some states called chemical test rights), you are subject to an automatic license suspension of one year and given six points on your record, among other penalties. \"Worse, even if you refuse the chemical rights test, the police will be able to obtain a warrant to draw your blood,\" says Misterovich. The one-year license suspension will likely have a greater impact on your life than an OWI charge. Plus, given the police's ability to draw your blood anyway, you could still be charged with OWI.\n\nSR-22 Insurance in Iowa\nIowa SR-22 rates for auto insurance applies to drivers who have at some point demonstrated reckless driving. An SR22 form is a voucher that an insurance company must submit to the Iowa Department of Transportation (IDOT). The form proves the driver has auto insurance as well as how much and when the policy was enacted. Not all drivers need SR22, and the IDOT outlines the guidelines under which it may be required. In most cases, an SR22 form is required to reinstate driving privileges due to license suspension. Described below is essential information on SR22 insurance and how it impacts your driving privileges. What is Iowa SR22 insurance? Insurance companies charge Iowa SR-22 rates to drivers who are required by law to obtain it as a part of their auto policy. As a policy add-on rather than a policy itself, an SR22 form demonstrates to the Iowa Department of Transportation that a driver has sufficient liability coverage as required by state law. The form contains information about the amount of liability coverage, the policy start date and whether or not the policy is active. A driver may not drop SR22 insurance without prior notice to the IDOT, as doing so could result in additional penalties and fines. Who needs SR22 insurance in Iowa? Most drivers do not need Iowa SR22 insurance, as the IDOT bases the requirement on traffic-related offenses. The IDOT determines who needs SR22 insurance forms and provides that driver with all the information about the requirement. According to the Iowa drivers manual, the IDOT requires the insurance for a variety of reasons, with the most common being:\n- Operating While Intoxicated (OWI) citation for a blood alcohol level .08 or higher. - Committing a vehicle offense that is punishable by a felony conviction such as vehicular manslaughter\n- Suspension due to out-of-state convictions\nDrivers questioning who needs SR22 insurance should consult the driver’s manual or speak with a member of IDOT staff for more information. In general, the state notifies drivers if they will need to purchase the insurance. The state also provides information on any necessary fees and the steps required to restore their driving privileges after a driver’s license suspension. Reinstating Driving Privileges With SR22 in Iowa\nIowa SR-22 rates for auto insurance cease once the driver has completed all requirements to restore their driving privileges. Once a driver is eligible to remove SR22 from their coverage, he or she must present what the state refers to as proof of future financial responsibility. In essence, motorists must prove to the IDOT that they have appropriate coverage in place to meet financial obligations for future driving incidents. Further, drivers must pay all applicable fees to reinstate their privileges. License and registration privileges apply to the vehicles for which motorists have provided proof of insurance. Thus, drivers must show proof of insurance for any vehicle registered in their name to cover all relevant cars. Drivers who are required to purchase SR22 insurance may qualify for a Temporary Restricted License (TRL). With a TRL, motorists may receive limited driving privileges to operate their vehicle for approved circumstances. Acceptable reasons for a TRL include driving to work, school or medical appointments. How to Get SR22 Insurance in Iowa\nIn Iowa, SR-22 rates are not set by the Department of Transportation. Insurance companies offer SR22 insurance quotes and provide the necessary coverage. Given that drivers who require this particular coverage are known for severe or repeated traffic-related incidents, many insurers do not offer the coverage. Those that do may charge a premium for the added feature to offset the potential financial risk for these drivers. As such, motorists should contact multiple companies for quotes. Some insurance companies offer SR-22 coverage as a rider to an existing policy. In some cases, they may require drivers to purchase an SR22 policy that contains the necessary coverage. Drivers who have questions on the specific amount of coverage needed should contact the IDOT for more information. How to File SR22 Insurance in Iowa\nAn Iowa SR22 form may only be submitted by an insurance company. The Department of Transportation does not accept SR22 forms from drivers, and motorists should request their insurer to file it on their behalf. Once submitted, the insurance company is required to update the Department of Transportation of any status changes on the policy. Should a driver cancel the SR22 policy, the insurer must notify the IDOT immediately.\n\n2.

Operating While Intoxicated is often referred to as an OWI, DUI or DWI. Under Iowa law, set out in Iowa Code section 321J.2, a conviction for an Operating While Intoxicated offense results when the prosecution is able to prove each of the necessary elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Those elements are listed below. The defendant operated a motor vehicle; AND\nAt the time of operation, the defendant was:\n- Under the influence of alcohol and\/or drug; or\n- Had an alcohol concentration in excess of .08; or\n- Had “any” amount of controlled substance present in their system. Under the Influence\nA person is legally “under the influence” of alcohol or a drug when any one of the following is true as a result of consumption of alcohol or use of a drug:\n- The person’s emotions are visibly excited;\n- The person’s judgment is impaired;\n- The person has lost control of their bodily actions or movements to any extent; or\n- The person’s mental ability has been affected. “Any amount” of controlled substance means just that; “any amount.” Thus, if a controlled substance is detected in a person’s system at or near the time they were operating a motor vehicle, they can be charged and potentially convicted of operating while intoxicated even if they were not even necessarily “impaired” by that substance. Determining Which Offense Current Charge is: First, Second or Third Offense\nOnly prior criminal convictions are counted to determine if a criminal charge is a First OWI, Second OWI or Third OWI offense. Prior license suspensions may be considered by sentencing judges but cannot form the basis for an enhancement of the pending criminal charge. How far back are drunk driving convictions considered? Iowa has a twelve (12) year “look back period” which is used to determine whether the current charge is a 1st OWI, 2nd OWI or 3rd OWI offense. The clock runs from the date of sentencing on the prior conviction to the date of the alleged current charge. Example: Person is arrested for operating while intoxicated on January 1, 2010. He has a prior arrest for operating while intoxicated on November 1, 1997 however he was not sentenced for the first offense until January 15, 1998. While the offense occurred more than 12 years before the pending offense, the person was sentenced for the first offense within 12 years of the new charge thus making the new charge a 2nd offense, an OWI – Second Offense. Third OWI Offenses\nWhen determining whether an offense is a Third OWI offense, the level of prior offense is irrelevant. All that matters is whether the individual has been convicted of any level of operating while intoxicated within the “look back period.” In other words you don’t have to be convicted of a 2nd offense in order for the next charge to be a 3rd offense. Sometimes prosecutors will amend a 2nd offense down to a 1st offense as part of a plea bargain but if that person picks up another charge and has two prior convictions for any level of operating while intoxicated, the new charge will be a 3rd offense. Iowa Minor Drinking & Driving Laws\nThere are two different types of legal problems that can arise for underage individuals that are stopped and investigated for operating while intoxicated. First, they can be charged with any and all operating while intoxicated offenses just as a person over the age of 21 may be charged. In these situations they face the same penalties and same consequences as someone over the age of 21, assuming the person is 18 years of age or older. Second, even if they provide a breath sample below .08 their driving privileges may be disqualified for what is commonly referred to as a “zero tolerance” violation. The “legal limit” for all criminal prosecutions in the State of Iowa for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated is .08. If a person under the age of 21 provides a breath sample in excess of .08 or is otherwise “under the influence” of alcohol, drug or a combination thereof, they will be charged with the normal operating while intoxicated offenses. However, individuals under the age of 21, there is a lower “legal limit” that applies only to license revocation proceedings.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:add05c50-7166-4a5e-a4f4-e11f973f4069>"]},{"passage":"(2) If the violation charged involved or resulted in an accident or injury to property and the total damages are less than five hundred dollars, the amount of fifty dollars plus court costs. (3) If the violation is for any offense for which a court appearance is mandatory, the amount of one hundred dollars plus court costs. d. The written appearance defined in paragraph \"b\" shall not be used for any offense other than a simple misdemeanor. 2. In addition to those violations which are required by subsection 1 to be charged upon a uniform citation and complaint, a violation of chapter 321 which is punishable as a simple, serious, or aggravated misdemeanor may be charged upon a uniform citation and complaint, whether or not the alleged offender is arrested by the officer making the charge. 3. Supplies of the uniform citation and complaint for municipal corporations and county agencies shall be paid for out of the budget of the municipal corporation or county receiving the fine resulting from use of the citation and complaint. Supplies of the uniform citation and complaint form used by other agencies shall be paid for out of the budget of the agency concerned and not out of the budget of the judicial department. 4.

For most of us, our transportation is essential to our livelihood and our daily family schedules and activities; and with a OWI, we often have to rearrange, not just our lives, but the lives of those around us. Every state may vary slightly in its rules of giving out an OWI, and how they enforce this driving restriction, but if you are a resident of Michigan, you may wonder what having a OWI on your record entails. Here is your answer:\nIn the state of Michigan, “drunk driving” is the label given to anyone driving with a blood alcohol level of 0.08% or higher. If a driver is caught with illegal drugs in their system, such as marijuana, cocaine, or GHB, the prosecution will not legally bear the burden of proving that you were impaired, just simply that you had any of these drugs in your system. Refusing to take a breathalyzer, blood, or urine test, will not help you if you are pulled over in Michigan for driving under the influence. The state has what is called an, “implied consent law,” which means that if you refuse the tests, your driver's license will be automatically suspended for a year, and in addition to any monetary and criminal penalties you receive, six points will be added to your license. For those who are not of the legal drinking age of 21, the law is even stricter for those caught driving under the influence. If a minor is caught with even an unopened container of alcohol while driving or parked in a lot, he or she will be charged with a criminal misdemeanor. If the underage driver has alcohol in their system, of 0.02% or greater, they will be arrested. Drivers can be charged with a list of violations depending upon the situation:\nOperating while visibly impaired (OWVI)\nOperating while intoxicated (OWI)\nOperating a vehicle with any presence of a schedule 1 drug or cocaine (in other words, even if you do not appear impaired, if there is even a trace of any of these drugs in your system, you can be prosecuted). There are various fees that a driver could face after their court hearing; including monetary fines, license suspensions and restrictions, vehicle immobilization, community service, and incarceration.

Frequently called DUIs in other states, an OWI is an official traffic violation for “operating while intoxicated.”\nFacing an OWI can present several challenges. However, understanding the possible OWI consequences can give you a clearer picture of your legal situation and the road ahead. If you have never received an OWI before, the consequences that you face will be less severe. For example, first-time offenders may encounter up to a $300 fine while fines can be anywhere from $25,000 to $50,000 for seventh, eighth or tenth offenses. Driver’s license suspension\nAlthough first-time offenses face lighter punishments, you can still lose your license with even one OWI. For first and second offenses, license suspension can be six to nine months, and additional OWIs can be for two to three years. In some cases, an OWI can cause a lifetime driver’s license revocation. Most first-time OWI cases do not involve jail time unless there is a minor in the situation. However, subsequent offenses can lead to anywhere from five days to 15 years behind bars. Sentencing also varies depending on how many OWIs you have had. With your fourth offense, the charge becomes a felony which can extend the amount of time that the incident remains on your record.

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), an estimated 10,228 people died in drunk driving crashes in 2011, accounting for 31 percent of all traffic deaths that year. Since NHTSA began recording alcohol-related statistics in 1982, drunk driving fatalities have decreased 52 percent, from 21,113 in 1982, in large part because of public awareness campaigns and tough nationwide laws. Nonetheless, in 2011, Florida's department of motor vehicles alone still recorded 33,625 DUI convictions. \"Drunk driving is incredibly serious,\" says Benjamin Luftman, a DUI attorney at Luftman, Heck & Associates in Columbus, Ohio. \"In Ohio, you can't expunge or seal a conviction of DUI. It's on your record for life.\" And a DUI can haunt every aspect of someone's life, from employment to insurance rates. \"I strongly believe that a DUI conviction can be a bar to employment. I usually explain that if an employer has 10 qualified applicants for a position, does a background check and one of them has a DUI conviction, that person will likely be amongst the first cut. That is especially true in as competitive a job market as we have today,\" says Luftman. Ohio's OVI (operating a vehicle under the influence) penalties are particularly harsh. A first offense gets you a possible three-day jail stint, a 72-hour intervention program (usually held in an area hotel), a three- to six-month license suspension and fines of $375 to $1,075. Blow over .17 on a breathalyzer test and your jail time is mandatory -- and you've bought yourself a specialized bright yellow DUI license plate for your suspension period that lets everyone know you got a DUI. Upon a second offense in Ohio, you get a mandatory ignition interlock, which costs up to $200 for installation and $80 per month maintenance. It uses a breathalyzer system that's connected to the vehicle's engine that's required to start the car and keep it running. If alcohol is detected the car won't start or will disable in motion. Currently 36 states have ignition interlock system laws. Refusing to blow\nSo why not refuse the breathalyzer? Here's why: The majority of states have some type of \"implied consent\" law. \"This means that when you sign up for your driver's license, you also consent to taking a breathalyzer test upon demand from a police officer,\" says Eric Misterovich, a DUI attorney at Newburg Law in St. Joseph, Mich. Many times people refuse a breathalyzer because they don't want to provide evidence of their blood alcohol to police out of fear of being arrested. However, the penalty for refusing the breath test can be harsher than the OWI charge, says Misterovich. \"A first-time OWI charge in Michigan is a misdemeanor punishable by 93 days in jail, $2,500 in various fines, six points on your record and a 30-day license suspension with an additional 150 days of a restricted license,\" he says. The majority of first-time offenders are not sentenced to jail; rather, they are given probation, fines and license restrictions. However, if you refuse to take a breathalyzer or refuse to take a chemical rights test in Michigan (but in some states called chemical test rights), you are subject to an automatic license suspension of one year and given six points on your record, among other penalties. \"Worse, even if you refuse the chemical rights test, the police will be able to obtain a warrant to draw your blood,\" says Misterovich. The one-year license suspension will likely have a greater impact on your life than an OWI charge. Plus, given the police's ability to draw your blood anyway, you could still be charged with OWI.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:2e65f8d3-8528-4067-a490-5d9cd8122b9c>"]},{"passage":"SR-22 Insurance in Iowa\nIowa SR-22 rates for auto insurance applies to drivers who have at some point demonstrated reckless driving. An SR22 form is a voucher that an insurance company must submit to the Iowa Department of Transportation (IDOT). The form proves the driver has auto insurance as well as how much and when the policy was enacted. Not all drivers need SR22, and the IDOT outlines the guidelines under which it may be required. In most cases, an SR22 form is required to reinstate driving privileges due to license suspension. Described below is essential information on SR22 insurance and how it impacts your driving privileges. What is Iowa SR22 insurance? Insurance companies charge Iowa SR-22 rates to drivers who are required by law to obtain it as a part of their auto policy. As a policy add-on rather than a policy itself, an SR22 form demonstrates to the Iowa Department of Transportation that a driver has sufficient liability coverage as required by state law. The form contains information about the amount of liability coverage, the policy start date and whether or not the policy is active. A driver may not drop SR22 insurance without prior notice to the IDOT, as doing so could result in additional penalties and fines. Who needs SR22 insurance in Iowa? Most drivers do not need Iowa SR22 insurance, as the IDOT bases the requirement on traffic-related offenses. The IDOT determines who needs SR22 insurance forms and provides that driver with all the information about the requirement. According to the Iowa drivers manual, the IDOT requires the insurance for a variety of reasons, with the most common being:\n- Operating While Intoxicated (OWI) citation for a blood alcohol level .08 or higher. - Committing a vehicle offense that is punishable by a felony conviction such as vehicular manslaughter\n- Suspension due to out-of-state convictions\nDrivers questioning who needs SR22 insurance should consult the driver’s manual or speak with a member of IDOT staff for more information. In general, the state notifies drivers if they will need to purchase the insurance. The state also provides information on any necessary fees and the steps required to restore their driving privileges after a driver’s license suspension. Reinstating Driving Privileges With SR22 in Iowa\nIowa SR-22 rates for auto insurance cease once the driver has completed all requirements to restore their driving privileges. Once a driver is eligible to remove SR22 from their coverage, he or she must present what the state refers to as proof of future financial responsibility. In essence, motorists must prove to the IDOT that they have appropriate coverage in place to meet financial obligations for future driving incidents. Further, drivers must pay all applicable fees to reinstate their privileges. License and registration privileges apply to the vehicles for which motorists have provided proof of insurance. Thus, drivers must show proof of insurance for any vehicle registered in their name to cover all relevant cars. Drivers who are required to purchase SR22 insurance may qualify for a Temporary Restricted License (TRL). With a TRL, motorists may receive limited driving privileges to operate their vehicle for approved circumstances. Acceptable reasons for a TRL include driving to work, school or medical appointments. How to Get SR22 Insurance in Iowa\nIn Iowa, SR-22 rates are not set by the Department of Transportation. Insurance companies offer SR22 insurance quotes and provide the necessary coverage. Given that drivers who require this particular coverage are known for severe or repeated traffic-related incidents, many insurers do not offer the coverage. Those that do may charge a premium for the added feature to offset the potential financial risk for these drivers. As such, motorists should contact multiple companies for quotes. Some insurance companies offer SR-22 coverage as a rider to an existing policy. In some cases, they may require drivers to purchase an SR22 policy that contains the necessary coverage. Drivers who have questions on the specific amount of coverage needed should contact the IDOT for more information. How to File SR22 Insurance in Iowa\nAn Iowa SR22 form may only be submitted by an insurance company. The Department of Transportation does not accept SR22 forms from drivers, and motorists should request their insurer to file it on their behalf. Once submitted, the insurance company is required to update the Department of Transportation of any status changes on the policy. Should a driver cancel the SR22 policy, the insurer must notify the IDOT immediately.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:05051511-aba2-45ca-be13-9049d32a1d32>"]},{"passage":"2.

While the Stafford Act may be the most familiar mechanism for Federal support, it is not the only one. Often, Federal assistance does not require coordination by the Department of Homeland Security and can be provided without a Presidential emergency or major disaster declaration. In these instances, Federal departments and agencies provide assistance to States, as well as directly to tribes and local jurisdictions, consistent with their own authorities. One of the tenets of professionalism in emergency management is the pursuit of continuous improvement. After the incident response winds down, resources are demobilized, and the EOC is deactivated, the emergency manager’s job is not finished. To complete the cycle of continuous improvement, it is important to conduct an after-action review to evaluate how well the policies and procedures outlined in the EOP worked, and how well prepared the jurisdiction was to conduct an effective response. This process should produce an after-action report and improvement plan with a timetable for carrying out any needed changes.

Recovering From Emergencies\nThe capabilities required to recover from emergencies focus on restoration, strengthening, and revitalization of infrastructure; housing; sustainable economy; and the health, social, cultural, historic, and environmental fabric of the community. Recovery operations may range from damage assessment and building inspection to restoration of services, facilities, and infrastructure. Recovery may include activities as diverse as care for survivors, community redevelopment, and support for business recovery. And recovery always requires documentation of disaster operations and costs. Recovery is a whole community endeavor, beginning with the individual and building to the larger community and local government. Community planning efforts are supported by voluntary, faith-based, and community organizations; local, State, tribal, and Federal governments; and the private sector. Each partner contributes resources and capabilities and represents different stakeholders within the community. All of these resources and efforts have to be managed and coordinated in order to accomplish an effective short- and long-term recovery. As an emergency manager, your role in the recovery process involves planning, managing, and coordinating the recovery effort. This lesson will introduce you to your recovery responsibilities and some of the resources available to you. The term recovery refers to those capabilities necessary to assist communities affected by an incident in recovering effectively. It is focused on a timely restoration, strengthening, and revitalization of:\n- Sustainable economy. - Health, social, cultural, historic, and environmental fabric of communities affected by a catastrophic incident.\n\n- Assist your partners in providing Individual Assistance by:\n- Pre-identifying where you might establish Disaster Recovery Centers (DRCs). - Once the disaster is declared, encouraging your citizens to register and visit a DRC. - Getting emergency management personnel actively involved to assist State and FEMA teams in the delivery of Individual Assistance programs. Recovery from disaster is unique to each community depending on the amount and kind of damage caused by the disaster and the resources that the community has ready or can get. Long-term recovery can take months or years because it is a complex process of revitalizing homes, businesses, public infrastructure, and the community’s economy and restoring quality of life. Long-term recovery considerations include:\n- Keeping people informed and preventing unrealistic expectations. - Conducting donations management. - Developing partnerships with business and industry for resources. - Considering competing interests of groups involved in the planning process. - Identifying environmental issues and public health measures. - Identifying the unmet needs of survivors. - Implementing mitigation measures while rebuilding infrastructure to ensure against future disaster damage. When we think about disaster recovery, we tend to think of rebuilding homes and businesses, repairing infrastructure, enforcing building codes, paying for new construction, and rebuilding the tax base. But communities are made up of people, and a community’s recovery process is not just material rebuilding and economic recovery. Recovery involves rebuilding emotional resilience and the individual and collective spirit of the community. Emergency managers can take steps before, during, and after a disaster that help facilitate the emotional healing process for survivors, response personnel, volunteers—for anyone in the community whose life or loved ones are touched by the event.

The guidance that seeks to prevent, protect, mitigate, respond, and recover is independent and requires the emergency department to employ the current preparedness networks, upgrade training programs, and ensure high capabilities of financial, administrative, and logistics systems. In addition, the above-presented goals provide the community and individuals with appropriate skills and knowledge that are aimed at enabling the entire community to benefit from the preparedness for natural disasters. Greater preparedness for contingencies reduces the probability of risks the nation might face and increases the level of sustainability. Consequently, as soon as the emergency department develops the core capabilities, it can be more prepared for various challenges. What is more important is that these capabilities will allow emergency managers to fill the existing gaps and define the targets for measuring and developing new approaches to coping with the natural contingencies. The existence of the core capabilities is important because they allow distributing the responsibilities among department managers. For instance, prevention mechanism deals with such spheres as intelligence and information exchange, forensics and attribution, detection, screening and search. Other capabilities refer to different areas for which emergency department holds responsibility. In my opinion, the emergency management makes everything possible to build, sustain, and develop the capabilities for strengthening community resources and advancing individuals’ capabilities. Personnel and equipment should be enhanced to ensure proper quality of plan implementation. Additionally, the national preparedness system focuses on the overall collaborative level of the community and individual perception of the critical responsibilities and tasks. It also ensures that the community is ready to react to natural disasters or man-made contingencies. However, there are still points that need to be discussed. This is of particular concern to the personnel department that should be constantly trained and developed to ensure the proper level of protection. \"This web helped me with writing my essay.

In reality, emergency management is not just about the core functions involved in response. It includes a broad array of program functions, and much of the work is of a nonemergency nature. Core functions are those that are critical to a successful emergency response. Emergency managers are responsible for the following core functions:\n- Direction, control, and coordination\n- External affairs\/Emergency public information\n- Population protection\n- Mass care, emergency assistance, housing, and human services\n- Public health and medical services\n- Logistics management and resource support\nIn addition to the emergency core functions, the emergency manager directs the day-to-day emergency management program that enables the jurisdiction to build and sustain needed capabilities and maintain a state of preparedness. Examples of nonemergency program activities include:\n- Ongoing monitoring of threat\/hazard information. - Developing and updating plans. - Recruiting and training staff. - Planning and coordinating exercises. - Budgeting, accounting, and grant writing. - Building relationships across the community. - Educating the public. - Organizing for hazard mitigation. - Soliciting public input on recovery planning. - Documenting, reporting, and managing information. A key role that runs through core functions and emergency functions alike is that of coordinating information—keeping the community, stakeholders, and officials informed. Information empowers community members to make informed choices that affect their health and well-being. And when incidents occur, information enables stakeholders to manage the situation effectively. Keeping the Public Informed\nRegardless of who delivers information to the public—the emergency manager, a public information officer, or other spokesperson—you are responsible for ensuring that a system is in place to keep the public informed and warned. The system must be able to reach all segments of the population, and the information they receive must be:\n- Simple and clear. - Focused on the immediate needs. - Helpful for building confidence in the response. Underlying all the other qualities, functions, and activities of an emergency manager is an expectation of ethical conduct. As an emergency management professional, you represent your organization and your profession. Your actions must instill trust and confidence in those with whom you work and in those who depend on you for assistance. In an emergency, the community and your partners must be able to count on you to carry out your responsibilities in a professional and fair manner. The SELF Test\nAsk yourself . . . Do my decisions withstand . . . Do my decisions . . . Do my decisions show . . . Are my decisions . . . Typical Emergency Manager Responsibilities\nNow that you have a general picture of the broad roles of the emergency manager, let’s take a closer look at what these roles mean in terms of specific responsibilities. Typical emergency manager tasks can be arranged by incident phase:\n- Determine overall capabilities. - Plan for emergencies that may arise and keep the emergency operations plan (EOP) up to date. - Provide support and advice to elected officials in establishing and carrying out policy. - Educate the public. - Plan, develop, conduct, and evaluate training and exercises. - Identify resource needs and sources of resources. Incident Response Responsibilities:\n- Establish and maintain a common understanding of the situation. - Coordinate with other agencies, jurisdictions, and levels of government on resource allocation, communications and information management, and public information. - Advise elected and appointed officials on policy. - Provide off-site support to the Incident Command (typically a small part of the emergency manager’s role). Post-Incident and Recovery Responsibilities:\n- Initiate damage assessments. - Coordinate with agencies providing food and shelter. - Coordinate with agencies to restore essential services (power, roads, etc.). - Conduct the after-action evaluation and develop an improvement plan. - Determine how emergency management and response can be better integrated. - Fully document incident activities and related costs. - Ensure that all bills are paid. - Replenish supplies. - Initiate long-term recovery plans. - Implement mitigation plans. - Oversee long-term recovery efforts.\n\n- Postdisaster planning is a discrete process for the disaster at hand that results in integrated recovery and reconstruction programs, actions, and recovery. Postdisaster plans are based on the strategy laid out in the predisaster plan and will guide funding for public-sector and nongovernmental investments. Disaster Recovery Operations\nDisaster recovery operations will vary with the type, scope, and duration of the disaster. However, disaster recovery typically consists of the following activities:\nRecovery management and coordination: Each partner contributes resources and capabilities and represents different stakeholders within the community. These resources and efforts have to be managed and coordinated in order to accomplish a speedy, efficient, and effective recovery. Damage assessment: Various types of damage assessments are conducted during response and recovery. They are used to gauge the impact of the disaster and to determine whether a request for a Presidential disaster declaration will be made and to help determine the funding levels of assistance programs and the eligibility for that funding. Care for survivors: Disaster survivors may require a variety of care options including medical assistance and supplies, evacuation from damaged facilities, and other functional needs. Community partners may be able to provide some of these services. You should be aware of the status of disaster survivors and how their needs are being addressed. Restoration of services, facilities, and infrastructure: Damaged or interrupted services, facilities, and infrastructure may need to be restored during recovery, including electrical power, natural gas, telecommunications, water\/sewer, solid waste collection and disposal, drainage and flood control systems, transportation systems, and community services. Building inspection: Building inspections are conducted during recovery to provide estimates of repairs based upon previous experience, actual estimates from contractors, or other sources. Potential issues related to such inspections include inspection practices, reentry and access, building permits, contractor licensing, code adequacy, and demolition. Community redevelopment: Repair and replacement of damaged structures provide tangible evidence that recovery is taking place. The planning and community development departments can compare development plans with hazard mapping to identify hazard reduction opportunities and requirements. They can also work closely with the business sector to facilitate economic recovery. These actions contribute to the resilience and sustainability of the community. Support for business recovery: The main opportunity for the business sector during recovery is its ability to form business alliances and professional organizations that can pool resources and solicit help for recovery both locally and nationally. In recent disasters, the business sector has become increasingly active in recovery operations by:\n- Providing resources to assist in recovery for other sectors of the community. - Forming business alliances and partnerships to assist those parts of the business community affected by the disaster. - Reaching out to regional and national business organizations to either request help or provide resources to others in need. Documentation of disaster operations and costs: The documentation of activities and costs is both a legal and financial concern for communities during disaster recovery. Disaster recovery activities should be documented to help protect the community from liability for damages or actions associated with disaster operations. Disaster recovery costs should be tracked in order to support requests for reimbursement in the event of State or Federal disaster declarations. The local emergency management office is an ideal coordination point for documentation and is often chosen for this task. Recovery Assistance Programs\nAlthough recovery is primarily a responsibility of local government, if the emergency or disaster receives a Presidential declaration, a number of assistance programs may be available under the Stafford Act. - Public Assistance is for repair of infrastructure, public facilities, and debris removal, and may include repair or replacement of non-Federal roads, public buildings, and bridges as well as implementation of mitigation measures. - Individual Assistance is for damage to residences and businesses or for personal property losses, and may include grants to individuals and families for temporary housing, repairs, replacement of possessions, and medical and funeral expenses; Small Business Administration (SBA) loans to individuals and businesses; crisis counseling for survivors and responders; legal services; and disaster unemployment benefits. Emergency Manager’s Role in Recovery Assistance\nAn emergency manager is not expected to become expert in the Federal recovery assistance programs and policies. However, there are things you can do to help the processes run smoothly:\n- Become aware of the Public Assistance program and how it may involve local\/tribal organizations.\n\n- Directing the establishment of alternative dispute resolution procedures (including binding arbitration), building on FEMA’s current appeals process, to resolve federal and state disagreements on costs and eligibility questions. - Directing the creation of a joint process for environmental and historical review for disaster recovery projects with the goal of increasing the speed of the process. Amendments to the Stafford Act also include:\n- Directing FEMA to study, and report to Congress, whether it is appropriate to increase the dollar size of “small projects” eligible for simplified procedures. - Including child care as an eligible expense under the “other needs assistance” provided in certain disasters. - Specifically authorizing the reimbursement of the base wages of government employees providing emergency work under certain circumstances. - Directing FEMA to update the factors considered when assessing the need for Individual Assistance in the declaration process. - Authorizing the chief executive of a tribal government to directly request disaster or emergency declarations from the President, much as a governor can for a state. - Directing FEMA to create a comprehensive national strategy for reducing the cost of future disasters.

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended (including the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 updates)\nAs the emergency management system evolves, the focus is increasingly on preparedness. Preparedness refers to actions taken to plan, organize, equip, train, and exercise to build and sustain the capabilities necessary to:\n- Protect against,\n- Mitigate the effects of,\n- Respond to, and\n- Recover from those threats that pose the greatest risk. Presidential Policy Directive 8\nPreparedness requires the commitment of our entire Nation. Presidential Policy Directive 8 (PPD-8) describes our Nation’s approach to national preparedness—one in which the whole community, including individuals, businesses, community- and faith-based organizations, schools, tribes, and all levels of government, works together in preparing for emergencies. National Preparedness Goal\nThe National Preparedness Goal presents an integrated, layered, and all-of-Nation approach to preparedness with an emphasis on building and sustaining core capabilities across five mission areas. Mission areas differ from phases of emergency management. Each area is comprised of the capabilities required for executing the mission or function at any time (before, during, or after an incident) and across all threats and hazards. It is important to shift your thinking to capabilities! Prevention: The capabilities necessary to avoid, prevent, or stop a threatened or actual act of terrorism. As defined by PPD-8, the term “prevention” refers to preventing imminent threats. Protection: The capabilities necessary to secure the homeland against acts of terrorism and manmade or natural disasters. Mitigation: The capabilities necessary to reduce loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters. Response: The capabilities necessary to save lives, protect property and the environment, and meet basic human needs after an incident has occurred. Recovery: The capabilities necessary to assist communities affected by an incident to recover effectively. What Are Core Capabilities? The core capabilities are distinct critical elements necessary to meet the National Preparedness Goal. Core capabilities are essential for the execution of each mission area. There are three core capabilities that cut across all five mission areas:\n- Public Information and Warning\n- Operational Coordination\nPrevention Mission Area Core Capabilities\nPlanning Conduct a systematic process engaging the whole community as appropriate in the development of executable strategic, operational, and\/or community-based approaches to meet defined objectives. Public Information and Warning Deliver coordinated, prompt, reliable, and actionable information to the whole community through the use of clear, consistent, accessible, and culturally and linguistically appropriate methods to effectively relay information regarding any threat or hazard, as well as the actions being taken and the assistance being made available, as appropriate. Operational Coordination Establish and maintain a unified and coordinated operational structure and process that appropriately integrates all critical stakeholders and supports the execution of core capabilities.\n\nHealth and Social Services Restore and improve health and social services networks to promote the resilience, independence, health (including behavioral health), and well-being of the whole community. Housing Implement housing solutions that effectively support the needs of the whole community and contribute to its sustainability and resilience. Infrastructure Systems Stabilize critical infrastructure functions, minimize health and safety threats, and efficiently restore and revitalize systems and services to support a viable, resilient community. Natural and Cultural Resources Protect natural and cultural resources and historic properties through appropriate planning, mitigation, response, and recovery actions to preserve, conserve, rehabilitate, and restore them consistent with post-disaster community priorities and best practices and in compliance with appropriate environmental and historical preservation laws and executive orders. National Preparedness System\nThe National Preparedness System is an integrated set of guidance, programs, and processes that enables the whole community to achieve the National Preparedness Goal. - Identifying and Assessing Risk\n- Estimating Capability Requirements\n- Building and Sustaining Capabilities\n- Planning to Deliver Capabilities\n- Validating Capabilities\n- Reviewing and Updating\nNational Incident Management System (NIMS)\nNIMS represents a core set of doctrines, concepts, principles, terminology, and organizational processes that enable effective, efficient, and collaborative incident management. NIMS integrates best practices into a comprehensive, standardized system that focuses on five key areas:\n- Communications and Information Management\n- Resource Management\n- Command and Management\n- Ongoing Management and Maintenance\nThis system is flexible enough to be used across the full spectrum of potential incidents, regardless of cause, size, location, or complexity. Using NIMS allows us to work together to prepare for, prevent, protect against, mitigate the effects of, respond to, and recover from incidents.

Lesson 2: Understanding Your Role\nThis lesson presents an overview of the emergency manager’s roles and responsibilities. After completing this lesson, you should be able to:\n- Identify the roles and responsibilities of an emergency manager. - Indicate ways in which the emergency manager’s role relates to the roles of emergency management partners, including:\n- State and Federal government. - Local government departments and agencies. - Private-sector and nongovernmental organizations. - Local response organizations. - Individuals, families, and households. What Does It Mean To Be an Emergency Manager? There is no single model for emergency management, either in organization or in size. Nationwide, there is great variety. For example, emergency management may function as a separate organization. In an ideal situation, the emergency manager answers directly to the jurisdiction’s chief executive, giving the executive direct access to unfiltered information from the emergency manager. In many communities emergency management is a function within the fire\/rescue, public safety, or law enforcement department. Often it is part of a volunteer department. Staff size may run the gamut from a single part-time or shared position, to a full-time employee, to a full-time director with a large staff, each with assigned areas of responsibility. Legal Duties of an Emergency Manager\nThe legal duties of emergency managers are based in:\n- Local emergency management ordinances. - State or tribal emergency management laws. - Standards such as NIMS and National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 1600. - Laws of general application (Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), civil rights, contract law, personnel law, government ethics law, etc.). Local, tribal, and State emergency management statutes and ordinances typically include a list of position responsibilities for various key players, including the emergency manager.\n\nRecovery is a sequence of interdependent and often concurrent activities that advance a community toward a successful recovery. Disaster recovery is based on the following core principles:\n|Individual and Family Empowerment||Individuals and households are encouraged to engage in their own recovery.|\n|Leadership and Local Primacy||It is important to remember that all disasters are local; therefore, local governments must be partners in all recovery actions taken on their behalf.|\n|Predisaster Recovery Planning||Individuals, households, and local governments can enhance their recovery from disaster by taking preparedness measures such as developing a predisaster recovery plan, using disaster-resistant building practices, and participating in or conducting training and exercise programs.|\n|Partnerships and Inclusiveness||Successful recovery involves the support and involvement of all stakeholders within the community and with outside entities that are assisting in recovery operations.|\n|Public Information||The public must be kept informed of the status of recovery operations if they are to support and participate in recovery activities.|\n|Unity of Effort||The combined efforts of all stakeholders will help achieve an effective recovery.|\n|Timeliness and Flexibility||There is no established timeframe for recovery to be accomplished. It depends on the makeup of the community, the nature and complexity of the incident, and the combined efforts of all stakeholders.|\n|Resilience and Sustainability||Successful recovery incorporates mitigation actions and best practices to help ensure the future viability of the community. It also involves the ability to adapt to changing conditions and withstand and rapidly recover from disruption due to emergencies.|\n|Psychological and Emotional Recovery||Disaster recovery isn’t just about restoring places and things. It also involves actions to help individuals and households cope with stress, illness, and uncertainty resulting from the disaster.|\nFactors in a Successful Recovery\nExperience shows that the following factors in a community can help ensure a successful recovery:\n- Effective decisionmaking and coordination\n- Integration of community recovery planning processes\n- Well-managed recovery\n- Proactive community engagement, public participation, and public awareness\n- Well-administered financial acquisition\n- Organizational flexibility\n- Resilient rebuilding\nRecovery—like other facets of emergency management—is a whole community endeavor, beginning with the individual and building to the larger community and local government. Community planning efforts are supported by voluntary, faith-based, and community organizations; local, State, tribal, and Federal governments; and the private sector. Each partner contributes resources and capabilities and represents different stakeholders within the community. These resources and efforts have to be managed and coordinated in order to accomplish a speedy, efficient, and effective recovery. Emergency Manager’s Recovery Role\nThe local government has the primary role of planning and managing all aspects of the community’s recovery. Individuals, families, and businesses look to local governments to articulate their recovery needs. Although community leaders are ultimately responsible for the recovery of their community, they rely on the emergency management team in general—and the emergency manager specifically—to manage and coordinate the disaster recovery effort. Recovery Task Force\nSome jurisdictions establish a local Recovery Task Force—often led by the emergency manager—to guide the community through recovery. If a Recovery Task Force has not been created by a community, the responsibility for managing and coordinating recovery resources and activities is still often accomplished by the emergency manager. In this capacity, you will not be directing or controlling the resources of other members of the emergency management team; rather, you will be coordinating those resources to help ensure their efficient use. Potential Members of a Recovery Task Force\n- Elected\/Appointed officials\n- Public information officer\n- Emergency management\n- Public safety department\n- Public works department\n- Building department\n- Finance department\n- Planning\/community development department\n- Community services\n- Health care (hospitals and public health)\n- Chamber of commerce\n- Business community\n- Voluntary agencies\n- School districts\n- Neighborhood\/Citizens groups\nBoth predisaster and postdisaster recovery planning are critical for communities to develop resilience and for successful and timely recovery. - Predisaster recovery planning identifies activities, priorities, and roles and responsibilities required for the community to recover from disaster. Predisaster recovery plans should include a continuity of government (COG) and continuity of operations (COOP) plan.\n\nIS-0001.a - Emergency Manager: An Orientation to the Position\nLesson 1: Emergency Management History and Principles\nThe goal of this course is to acquaint you with the position of emergency manager, including history and underlying principles of emergency management, key areas of emphasis, the emergency manager’s roles and responsibilities, and tips for getting started.

What Is Emergency Management? Throughout our Nation’s history, communities have always bonded together when disaster strikes. Emergency management simply creates a framework to help communities reduce vulnerabilities to threats and hazards and cope with disasters. Emergency management is an essential role of government. The Constitution tasks the States with responsibility for public health and safety―hence, they are responsible for public risks, while the Federal Government’s ultimate obligation is to help when State, local, or individual entities are overwhelmed. The overall goals of emergency management at all levels are:\n- First, to reduce the loss of life;\n- Then, to minimize property loss and damage to the environment;\n- And finally, to protect the jurisdiction from all threats and hazards. We tend to think of emergency management as a relatively new concept. However, the idea of assessing risks and organizing to deal with those risks has been around, in one fashion or another, since humans began forming civilizations. Our current vision of emergency management has not always been the same as it is today. Rather, it has evolved to reflect our national values and the threats we face. Today we seek to create a secure and resilient Nation. We have learned that doing so requires that we work together to build and sustain capabilities across the whole community to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from the threats and hazards that pose the greatest risk. What Is Emergency Management? There are numerous definitions of emergency management. The definition below is based on the one developed by the International Association of Emergency Managers (IAEM). Why Emergency Management? The reasons for the emergency management function are timeless and enduring, and include the following:\n- Threats and hazards exist—always have and always will. - Experience and empirical observation indicate that disaster events have a significant impact on humans and the environment. - Success in dealing with disasters depends primarily on how well prepared, organized, and coordinated we are. - Experience has shown that emergency management principles and practices actually work to achieve successful outcomes. Integrated Emergency Management\nEmergency management must be integrated into daily decisions, not just during times of disasters. Integrated emergency management:\n- Is a way of thinking about emergency management as a joint enterprise among the whole community among government, key community partners, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector. - Embodies an all-threats\/hazards approach to the direction, control, and coordination of disasters regardless of their location, size, or complexity. - Increases emergency management capability through:\n- Prior networks, linkages, and partnerships. - Communication across organizational and jurisdictional boundaries. - Creative thinking about resource shortfalls. - Coordinated testing, training, and exercising. - Improved ability to see the “big picture” for simultaneous responses.\n\n- Respond and assist with biological or radiological emergencies or events affecting our community safety, health, and well being\n- Assess and make recommendations and assist with environmental health sanitation issues, including potable (safe) drinking water supplies, sanitary sewage treatment, shelters and housing needs, diseases – information on causes and prevention, disease vector identification (insects, vermin, etc. ), control, and prevention; inspect \/ license food service operations and retail food establishments; assist with emergency response to potential and real emergencies and events; etc. - Assist with other roles and needs, such as providing resources, staff, equipment, supplies as available and to the level of training and credentials, ICS roles, public information officer roles, etc. - Other needs as capabilities and capacities could allow, etc. To better prepare yourself, your family, your neighborhood, and your community for the next emergency, disaster, incident, or event, consider the following:\nKnow your risks – understand the risks that you, your family and neighbors, and your community face from a variety of hazards, emergencies, and events. Most communities face many types of hazards. It is important to learn the risks to your specific area and the ways to assess your risks when you are away from home. Know how and when to take action before, during, and after different hazards, emergencies, and events that can occur and impact safety and health of those nearby. Make a plan – make a communications plan for you and your family and prepare for both evacuation and shelter in place scenarios. Prepare for your family and their unique needs with customized plans and supplies needed. Consider medications needed and any pet or livestock needs. Also, use your social network to help other family members, friends, and neighbors prepare. Participate in your neighborhood and community with a variety of disaster preparedness awareness activities. Also important is the need to gather emergency supplies such as a supply of water and food. Secure important family information and documents you will need to start the recovery process after the emergency or event is over. Take action – put your plan into action. Be ready and able to face disaster, no matter where you may be and when they may occur. Check your insurance needs and understand your coverage options. Make a list of personal property and the value and condition of things. Consider how to mitigate to minimize property damages for emergencies and events. Practice your family emergency plans. Utilize existing alert and warning systems in your area. Assist with your neighborhood and community preparedness and recovery efforts.","passages":[{"passage":"When needs exceed local, tribal, and State resources, the Governor may request Federal assistance under the Stafford Act. While the Stafford Act may be the most familiar mechanism for Federal support, it is not the only one. Often, Federal assistance does not require coordination by the Department of Homeland Security and can be provided without a Presidential emergency or major disaster declaration. In these instances, Federal departments and agencies provide assistance to States, as well as directly to tribes and local jurisdictions, consistent with their own authorities. One of the tenets of professionalism in emergency management is the pursuit of continuous improvement. After the incident response winds down, resources are demobilized, and the EOC is deactivated, the emergency manager’s job is not finished. To complete the cycle of continuous improvement, it is important to conduct an after-action review to evaluate how well the policies and procedures outlined in the EOP worked, and how well prepared the jurisdiction was to conduct an effective response. This process should produce an after-action report and improvement plan with a timetable for carrying out any needed changes.

Lesson 7: Recovering From Emergencies\nThis lesson discusses the emergency manager’s role in recovering from an emergency. After completing this lesson, you should be able to:\n- Identify key roles and responsibilities of the emergency manager in disaster recovery. - Identify core principles for recovery. - Describe the purpose of a predisaster recovery plan. - Identify typical disaster recovery operations. - Indicate the purpose of the Individual Assistance and Public Assistance programs. Recovering From Emergencies\nThe capabilities required to recover from emergencies focus on restoration, strengthening, and revitalization of infrastructure; housing; sustainable economy; and the health, social, cultural, historic, and environmental fabric of the community. Recovery operations may range from damage assessment and building inspection to restoration of services, facilities, and infrastructure. Recovery may include activities as diverse as care for survivors, community redevelopment, and support for business recovery. And recovery always requires documentation of disaster operations and costs. Recovery is a whole community endeavor, beginning with the individual and building to the larger community and local government. Community planning efforts are supported by voluntary, faith-based, and community organizations; local, State, tribal, and Federal governments; and the private sector. Each partner contributes resources and capabilities and represents different stakeholders within the community. All of these resources and efforts have to be managed and coordinated in order to accomplish an effective short- and long-term recovery. As an emergency manager, your role in the recovery process involves planning, managing, and coordinating the recovery effort. This lesson will introduce you to your recovery responsibilities and some of the resources available to you. The term recovery refers to those capabilities necessary to assist communities affected by an incident in recovering effectively. It is focused on a timely restoration, strengthening, and revitalization of:\n- Sustainable economy. - Health, social, cultural, historic, and environmental fabric of communities affected by a catastrophic incident.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:c9e76d0f-8e7f-4444-bb59-15589f9fe9ca>"]},{"passage":"- Assist your partners in providing Individual Assistance by:\n- Pre-identifying where you might establish Disaster Recovery Centers (DRCs). - Once the disaster is declared, encouraging your citizens to register and visit a DRC. - Getting emergency management personnel actively involved to assist State and FEMA teams in the delivery of Individual Assistance programs. Recovery from disaster is unique to each community depending on the amount and kind of damage caused by the disaster and the resources that the community has ready or can get. Long-term recovery can take months or years because it is a complex process of revitalizing homes, businesses, public infrastructure, and the community’s economy and restoring quality of life. Long-term recovery considerations include:\n- Keeping people informed and preventing unrealistic expectations. - Conducting donations management. - Developing partnerships with business and industry for resources. - Considering competing interests of groups involved in the planning process. - Identifying environmental issues and public health measures. - Identifying the unmet needs of survivors. - Implementing mitigation measures while rebuilding infrastructure to ensure against future disaster damage. When we think about disaster recovery, we tend to think of rebuilding homes and businesses, repairing infrastructure, enforcing building codes, paying for new construction, and rebuilding the tax base. But communities are made up of people, and a community’s recovery process is not just material rebuilding and economic recovery. Recovery involves rebuilding emotional resilience and the individual and collective spirit of the community. Emergency managers can take steps before, during, and after a disaster that help facilitate the emotional healing process for survivors, response personnel, volunteers—for anyone in the community whose life or loved ones are touched by the event.

The guidance that seeks to prevent, protect, mitigate, respond, and recover is independent and requires the emergency department to employ the current preparedness networks, upgrade training programs, and ensure high capabilities of financial, administrative, and logistics systems. In addition, the above-presented goals provide the community and individuals with appropriate skills and knowledge that are aimed at enabling the entire community to benefit from the preparedness for natural disasters. Greater preparedness for contingencies reduces the probability of risks the nation might face and increases the level of sustainability. Consequently, as soon as the emergency department develops the core capabilities, it can be more prepared for various challenges. What is more important is that these capabilities will allow emergency managers to fill the existing gaps and define the targets for measuring and developing new approaches to coping with the natural contingencies. The existence of the core capabilities is important because they allow distributing the responsibilities among department managers. For instance, prevention mechanism deals with such spheres as intelligence and information exchange, forensics and attribution, detection, screening and search. Other capabilities refer to different areas for which emergency department holds responsibility. In my opinion, the emergency management makes everything possible to build, sustain, and develop the capabilities for strengthening community resources and advancing individuals’ capabilities. Personnel and equipment should be enhanced to ensure proper quality of plan implementation. Additionally, the national preparedness system focuses on the overall collaborative level of the community and individual perception of the critical responsibilities and tasks. It also ensures that the community is ready to react to natural disasters or man-made contingencies. However, there are still points that need to be discussed. This is of particular concern to the personnel department that should be constantly trained and developed to ensure the proper level of protection. \"This web helped me with writing my essay.

In reality, emergency management is not just about the core functions involved in response. It includes a broad array of program functions, and much of the work is of a nonemergency nature. Core functions are those that are critical to a successful emergency response. Emergency managers are responsible for the following core functions:\n- Direction, control, and coordination\n- External affairs\/Emergency public information\n- Population protection\n- Mass care, emergency assistance, housing, and human services\n- Public health and medical services\n- Logistics management and resource support\nIn addition to the emergency core functions, the emergency manager directs the day-to-day emergency management program that enables the jurisdiction to build and sustain needed capabilities and maintain a state of preparedness. Examples of nonemergency program activities include:\n- Ongoing monitoring of threat\/hazard information. - Developing and updating plans. - Recruiting and training staff. - Planning and coordinating exercises. - Budgeting, accounting, and grant writing. - Building relationships across the community. - Educating the public. - Organizing for hazard mitigation. - Soliciting public input on recovery planning. - Documenting, reporting, and managing information. A key role that runs through core functions and emergency functions alike is that of coordinating information—keeping the community, stakeholders, and officials informed. Information empowers community members to make informed choices that affect their health and well-being. And when incidents occur, information enables stakeholders to manage the situation effectively. Keeping the Public Informed\nRegardless of who delivers information to the public—the emergency manager, a public information officer, or other spokesperson—you are responsible for ensuring that a system is in place to keep the public informed and warned. The system must be able to reach all segments of the population, and the information they receive must be:\n- Simple and clear. - Focused on the immediate needs. - Helpful for building confidence in the response. Underlying all the other qualities, functions, and activities of an emergency manager is an expectation of ethical conduct. As an emergency management professional, you represent your organization and your profession. Your actions must instill trust and confidence in those with whom you work and in those who depend on you for assistance. In an emergency, the community and your partners must be able to count on you to carry out your responsibilities in a professional and fair manner. The SELF Test\nAsk yourself . . . Do my decisions withstand . . . Do my decisions . . . Do my decisions show . . . Are my decisions . . . Typical Emergency Manager Responsibilities\nNow that you have a general picture of the broad roles of the emergency manager, let’s take a closer look at what these roles mean in terms of specific responsibilities. Typical emergency manager tasks can be arranged by incident phase:\n- Determine overall capabilities. - Plan for emergencies that may arise and keep the emergency operations plan (EOP) up to date. - Provide support and advice to elected officials in establishing and carrying out policy. - Educate the public. - Plan, develop, conduct, and evaluate training and exercises. - Identify resource needs and sources of resources. Incident Response Responsibilities:\n- Establish and maintain a common understanding of the situation. - Coordinate with other agencies, jurisdictions, and levels of government on resource allocation, communications and information management, and public information. - Advise elected and appointed officials on policy. - Provide off-site support to the Incident Command (typically a small part of the emergency manager’s role). Post-Incident and Recovery Responsibilities:\n- Initiate damage assessments. - Coordinate with agencies providing food and shelter. - Coordinate with agencies to restore essential services (power, roads, etc.). - Conduct the after-action evaluation and develop an improvement plan. - Determine how emergency management and response can be better integrated. - Fully document incident activities and related costs. - Ensure that all bills are paid. - Replenish supplies. - Initiate long-term recovery plans. - Implement mitigation plans. - Oversee long-term recovery efforts.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:c9e76d0f-8e7f-4444-bb59-15589f9fe9ca>"]},{"passage":"- Postdisaster planning is a discrete process for the disaster at hand that results in integrated recovery and reconstruction programs, actions, and recovery. Postdisaster plans are based on the strategy laid out in the predisaster plan and will guide funding for public-sector and nongovernmental investments. Disaster Recovery Operations\nDisaster recovery operations will vary with the type, scope, and duration of the disaster. However, disaster recovery typically consists of the following activities:\nRecovery management and coordination: Each partner contributes resources and capabilities and represents different stakeholders within the community. These resources and efforts have to be managed and coordinated in order to accomplish a speedy, efficient, and effective recovery. Damage assessment: Various types of damage assessments are conducted during response and recovery. They are used to gauge the impact of the disaster and to determine whether a request for a Presidential disaster declaration will be made and to help determine the funding levels of assistance programs and the eligibility for that funding. Care for survivors: Disaster survivors may require a variety of care options including medical assistance and supplies, evacuation from damaged facilities, and other functional needs. Community partners may be able to provide some of these services. You should be aware of the status of disaster survivors and how their needs are being addressed. Restoration of services, facilities, and infrastructure: Damaged or interrupted services, facilities, and infrastructure may need to be restored during recovery, including electrical power, natural gas, telecommunications, water\/sewer, solid waste collection and disposal, drainage and flood control systems, transportation systems, and community services. Building inspection: Building inspections are conducted during recovery to provide estimates of repairs based upon previous experience, actual estimates from contractors, or other sources. Potential issues related to such inspections include inspection practices, reentry and access, building permits, contractor licensing, code adequacy, and demolition. Community redevelopment: Repair and replacement of damaged structures provide tangible evidence that recovery is taking place. The planning and community development departments can compare development plans with hazard mapping to identify hazard reduction opportunities and requirements. They can also work closely with the business sector to facilitate economic recovery. These actions contribute to the resilience and sustainability of the community. Support for business recovery: The main opportunity for the business sector during recovery is its ability to form business alliances and professional organizations that can pool resources and solicit help for recovery both locally and nationally. In recent disasters, the business sector has become increasingly active in recovery operations by:\n- Providing resources to assist in recovery for other sectors of the community. - Forming business alliances and partnerships to assist those parts of the business community affected by the disaster. - Reaching out to regional and national business organizations to either request help or provide resources to others in need. Documentation of disaster operations and costs: The documentation of activities and costs is both a legal and financial concern for communities during disaster recovery. Disaster recovery activities should be documented to help protect the community from liability for damages or actions associated with disaster operations. Disaster recovery costs should be tracked in order to support requests for reimbursement in the event of State or Federal disaster declarations. The local emergency management office is an ideal coordination point for documentation and is often chosen for this task. Recovery Assistance Programs\nAlthough recovery is primarily a responsibility of local government, if the emergency or disaster receives a Presidential declaration, a number of assistance programs may be available under the Stafford Act. - Public Assistance is for repair of infrastructure, public facilities, and debris removal, and may include repair or replacement of non-Federal roads, public buildings, and bridges as well as implementation of mitigation measures. - Individual Assistance is for damage to residences and businesses or for personal property losses, and may include grants to individuals and families for temporary housing, repairs, replacement of possessions, and medical and funeral expenses; Small Business Administration (SBA) loans to individuals and businesses; crisis counseling for survivors and responders; legal services; and disaster unemployment benefits. Emergency Manager’s Role in Recovery Assistance\nAn emergency manager is not expected to become expert in the Federal recovery assistance programs and policies. However, there are things you can do to help the processes run smoothly:\n- Become aware of the Public Assistance program and how it may involve local\/tribal organizations.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:c9e76d0f-8e7f-4444-bb59-15589f9fe9ca>"]},{"passage":"- Directing the establishment of alternative dispute resolution procedures (including binding arbitration), building on FEMA’s current appeals process, to resolve federal and state disagreements on costs and eligibility questions. - Directing the creation of a joint process for environmental and historical review for disaster recovery projects with the goal of increasing the speed of the process. Amendments to the Stafford Act also include:\n- Directing FEMA to study, and report to Congress, whether it is appropriate to increase the dollar size of “small projects” eligible for simplified procedures. - Including child care as an eligible expense under the “other needs assistance” provided in certain disasters. - Specifically authorizing the reimbursement of the base wages of government employees providing emergency work under certain circumstances. - Directing FEMA to update the factors considered when assessing the need for Individual Assistance in the declaration process. - Authorizing the chief executive of a tribal government to directly request disaster or emergency declarations from the President, much as a governor can for a state. - Directing FEMA to create a comprehensive national strategy for reducing the cost of future disasters.

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended (including the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 updates)\nAs the emergency management system evolves, the focus is increasingly on preparedness. Preparedness refers to actions taken to plan, organize, equip, train, and exercise to build and sustain the capabilities necessary to:\n- Protect against,\n- Mitigate the effects of,\n- Respond to, and\n- Recover from those threats that pose the greatest risk. Presidential Policy Directive 8\nPreparedness requires the commitment of our entire Nation. Presidential Policy Directive 8 (PPD-8) describes our Nation’s approach to national preparedness—one in which the whole community, including individuals, businesses, community- and faith-based organizations, schools, tribes, and all levels of government, works together in preparing for emergencies. National Preparedness Goal\nThe National Preparedness Goal presents an integrated, layered, and all-of-Nation approach to preparedness with an emphasis on building and sustaining core capabilities across five mission areas. Mission areas differ from phases of emergency management. Each area is comprised of the capabilities required for executing the mission or function at any time (before, during, or after an incident) and across all threats and hazards. It is important to shift your thinking to capabilities! Prevention: The capabilities necessary to avoid, prevent, or stop a threatened or actual act of terrorism. As defined by PPD-8, the term “prevention” refers to preventing imminent threats. Protection: The capabilities necessary to secure the homeland against acts of terrorism and manmade or natural disasters. Mitigation: The capabilities necessary to reduce loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters. Response: The capabilities necessary to save lives, protect property and the environment, and meet basic human needs after an incident has occurred. Recovery: The capabilities necessary to assist communities affected by an incident to recover effectively. What Are Core Capabilities? The core capabilities are distinct critical elements necessary to meet the National Preparedness Goal. Core capabilities are essential for the execution of each mission area. There are three core capabilities that cut across all five mission areas:\n- Public Information and Warning\n- Operational Coordination\nPrevention Mission Area Core Capabilities\nPlanning Conduct a systematic process engaging the whole community as appropriate in the development of executable strategic, operational, and\/or community-based approaches to meet defined objectives. Public Information and Warning Deliver coordinated, prompt, reliable, and actionable information to the whole community through the use of clear, consistent, accessible, and culturally and linguistically appropriate methods to effectively relay information regarding any threat or hazard, as well as the actions being taken and the assistance being made available, as appropriate. Operational Coordination Establish and maintain a unified and coordinated operational structure and process that appropriately integrates all critical stakeholders and supports the execution of core capabilities.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:c9e76d0f-8e7f-4444-bb59-15589f9fe9ca>"]},{"passage":"Health and Social Services Restore and improve health and social services networks to promote the resilience, independence, health (including behavioral health), and well-being of the whole community. Housing Implement housing solutions that effectively support the needs of the whole community and contribute to its sustainability and resilience. Infrastructure Systems Stabilize critical infrastructure functions, minimize health and safety threats, and efficiently restore and revitalize systems and services to support a viable, resilient community. Natural and Cultural Resources Protect natural and cultural resources and historic properties through appropriate planning, mitigation, response, and recovery actions to preserve, conserve, rehabilitate, and restore them consistent with post-disaster community priorities and best practices and in compliance with appropriate environmental and historical preservation laws and executive orders. National Preparedness System\nThe National Preparedness System is an integrated set of guidance, programs, and processes that enables the whole community to achieve the National Preparedness Goal. - Identifying and Assessing Risk\n- Estimating Capability Requirements\n- Building and Sustaining Capabilities\n- Planning to Deliver Capabilities\n- Validating Capabilities\n- Reviewing and Updating\nNational Incident Management System (NIMS)\nNIMS represents a core set of doctrines, concepts, principles, terminology, and organizational processes that enable effective, efficient, and collaborative incident management. NIMS integrates best practices into a comprehensive, standardized system that focuses on five key areas:\n- Communications and Information Management\n- Resource Management\n- Command and Management\n- Ongoing Management and Maintenance\nThis system is flexible enough to be used across the full spectrum of potential incidents, regardless of cause, size, location, or complexity. Using NIMS allows us to work together to prepare for, prevent, protect against, mitigate the effects of, respond to, and recover from incidents.

What Does It Mean To Be an Emergency Manager? There is no single model for emergency management, either in organization or in size. Nationwide, there is great variety. For example, emergency management may function as a separate organization. In an ideal situation, the emergency manager answers directly to the jurisdiction’s chief executive, giving the executive direct access to unfiltered information from the emergency manager. In many communities emergency management is a function within the fire\/rescue, public safety, or law enforcement department. Often it is part of a volunteer department. Staff size may run the gamut from a single part-time or shared position, to a full-time employee, to a full-time director with a large staff, each with assigned areas of responsibility. Legal Duties of an Emergency Manager\nThe legal duties of emergency managers are based in:\n- Local emergency management ordinances. - State or tribal emergency management laws. - Standards such as NIMS and National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 1600. - Laws of general application (Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), civil rights, contract law, personnel law, government ethics law, etc.). Local, tribal, and State emergency management statutes and ordinances typically include a list of position responsibilities for various key players, including the emergency manager.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:c9e76d0f-8e7f-4444-bb59-15589f9fe9ca>"]},{"passage":"Recovery is a sequence of interdependent and often concurrent activities that advance a community toward a successful recovery. Disaster recovery is based on the following core principles:\n|Individual and Family Empowerment||Individuals and households are encouraged to engage in their own recovery.|\n|Leadership and Local Primacy||It is important to remember that all disasters are local; therefore, local governments must be partners in all recovery actions taken on their behalf.|\n|Predisaster Recovery Planning||Individuals, households, and local governments can enhance their recovery from disaster by taking preparedness measures such as developing a predisaster recovery plan, using disaster-resistant building practices, and participating in or conducting training and exercise programs.|\n|Partnerships and Inclusiveness||Successful recovery involves the support and involvement of all stakeholders within the community and with outside entities that are assisting in recovery operations.|\n|Public Information||The public must be kept informed of the status of recovery operations if they are to support and participate in recovery activities.|\n|Unity of Effort||The combined efforts of all stakeholders will help achieve an effective recovery.|\n|Timeliness and Flexibility||There is no established timeframe for recovery to be accomplished. It depends on the makeup of the community, the nature and complexity of the incident, and the combined efforts of all stakeholders.|\n|Resilience and Sustainability||Successful recovery incorporates mitigation actions and best practices to help ensure the future viability of the community. It also involves the ability to adapt to changing conditions and withstand and rapidly recover from disruption due to emergencies.|\n|Psychological and Emotional Recovery||Disaster recovery isn’t just about restoring places and things. It also involves actions to help individuals and households cope with stress, illness, and uncertainty resulting from the disaster.|\nFactors in a Successful Recovery\nExperience shows that the following factors in a community can help ensure a successful recovery:\n- Effective decisionmaking and coordination\n- Integration of community recovery planning processes\n- Well-managed recovery\n- Proactive community engagement, public participation, and public awareness\n- Well-administered financial acquisition\n- Organizational flexibility\n- Resilient rebuilding\nRecovery—like other facets of emergency management—is a whole community endeavor, beginning with the individual and building to the larger community and local government. Community planning efforts are supported by voluntary, faith-based, and community organizations; local, State, tribal, and Federal governments; and the private sector. Each partner contributes resources and capabilities and represents different stakeholders within the community. These resources and efforts have to be managed and coordinated in order to accomplish a speedy, efficient, and effective recovery. Emergency Manager’s Recovery Role\nThe local government has the primary role of planning and managing all aspects of the community’s recovery. Individuals, families, and businesses look to local governments to articulate their recovery needs. Although community leaders are ultimately responsible for the recovery of their community, they rely on the emergency management team in general—and the emergency manager specifically—to manage and coordinate the disaster recovery effort. Recovery Task Force\nSome jurisdictions establish a local Recovery Task Force—often led by the emergency manager—to guide the community through recovery. If a Recovery Task Force has not been created by a community, the responsibility for managing and coordinating recovery resources and activities is still often accomplished by the emergency manager. In this capacity, you will not be directing or controlling the resources of other members of the emergency management team; rather, you will be coordinating those resources to help ensure their efficient use. Potential Members of a Recovery Task Force\n- Elected\/Appointed officials\n- Public information officer\n- Emergency management\n- Public safety department\n- Public works department\n- Building department\n- Finance department\n- Planning\/community development department\n- Community services\n- Health care (hospitals and public health)\n- Chamber of commerce\n- Business community\n- Voluntary agencies\n- School districts\n- Neighborhood\/Citizens groups\nBoth predisaster and postdisaster recovery planning are critical for communities to develop resilience and for successful and timely recovery. - Predisaster recovery planning identifies activities, priorities, and roles and responsibilities required for the community to recover from disaster. Predisaster recovery plans should include a continuity of government (COG) and continuity of operations (COOP) plan.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:c9e76d0f-8e7f-4444-bb59-15589f9fe9ca>"]},{"passage":"IS-0001.a - Emergency Manager: An Orientation to the Position\nLesson 1: Emergency Management History and Principles\nThe goal of this course is to acquaint you with the position of emergency manager, including history and underlying principles of emergency management, key areas of emphasis, the emergency manager’s roles and responsibilities, and tips for getting started.

What Is Emergency Management? Throughout our Nation’s history, communities have always bonded together when disaster strikes. Emergency management simply creates a framework to help communities reduce vulnerabilities to threats and hazards and cope with disasters. Emergency management is an essential role of government. The Constitution tasks the States with responsibility for public health and safety―hence, they are responsible for public risks, while the Federal Government’s ultimate obligation is to help when State, local, or individual entities are overwhelmed. The overall goals of emergency management at all levels are:\n- First, to reduce the loss of life;\n- Then, to minimize property loss and damage to the environment;\n- And finally, to protect the jurisdiction from all threats and hazards. We tend to think of emergency management as a relatively new concept. However, the idea of assessing risks and organizing to deal with those risks has been around, in one fashion or another, since humans began forming civilizations. Our current vision of emergency management has not always been the same as it is today. Rather, it has evolved to reflect our national values and the threats we face. Today we seek to create a secure and resilient Nation. We have learned that doing so requires that we work together to build and sustain capabilities across the whole community to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from the threats and hazards that pose the greatest risk. What Is Emergency Management? There are numerous definitions of emergency management. The definition below is based on the one developed by the International Association of Emergency Managers (IAEM). Why Emergency Management? The reasons for the emergency management function are timeless and enduring, and include the following:\n- Threats and hazards exist—always have and always will. - Experience and empirical observation indicate that disaster events have a significant impact on humans and the environment. - Success in dealing with disasters depends primarily on how well prepared, organized, and coordinated we are. - Experience has shown that emergency management principles and practices actually work to achieve successful outcomes. Integrated Emergency Management\nEmergency management must be integrated into daily decisions, not just during times of disasters. Integrated emergency management:\n- Is a way of thinking about emergency management as a joint enterprise among the whole community among government, key community partners, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector. - Embodies an all-threats\/hazards approach to the direction, control, and coordination of disasters regardless of their location, size, or complexity. - Increases emergency management capability through:\n- Prior networks, linkages, and partnerships. - Communication across organizational and jurisdictional boundaries. - Creative thinking about resource shortfalls. - Coordinated testing, training, and exercising. - Improved ability to see the “big picture” for simultaneous responses.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:c9e76d0f-8e7f-4444-bb59-15589f9fe9ca>"]},{"passage":"- Respond and assist with biological or radiological emergencies or events affecting our community safety, health, and well being\n- Assess and make recommendations and assist with environmental health sanitation issues, including potable (safe) drinking water supplies, sanitary sewage treatment, shelters and housing needs, diseases – information on causes and prevention, disease vector identification (insects, vermin, etc. ), control, and prevention; inspect \/ license food service operations and retail food establishments; assist with emergency response to potential and real emergencies and events; etc. - Assist with other roles and needs, such as providing resources, staff, equipment, supplies as available and to the level of training and credentials, ICS roles, public information officer roles, etc. - Other needs as capabilities and capacities could allow, etc. To better prepare yourself, your family, your neighborhood, and your community for the next emergency, disaster, incident, or event, consider the following:\nKnow your risks – understand the risks that you, your family and neighbors, and your community face from a variety of hazards, emergencies, and events. Most communities face many types of hazards. It is important to learn the risks to your specific area and the ways to assess your risks when you are away from home. Know how and when to take action before, during, and after different hazards, emergencies, and events that can occur and impact safety and health of those nearby. Make a plan – make a communications plan for you and your family and prepare for both evacuation and shelter in place scenarios. Prepare for your family and their unique needs with customized plans and supplies needed. Consider medications needed and any pet or livestock needs. Also, use your social network to help other family members, friends, and neighbors prepare. Participate in your neighborhood and community with a variety of disaster preparedness awareness activities. Also important is the need to gather emergency supplies such as a supply of water and food. Secure important family information and documents you will need to start the recovery process after the emergency or event is over. Take action – put your plan into action. Be ready and able to face disaster, no matter where you may be and when they may occur. Check your insurance needs and understand your coverage options. Make a list of personal property and the value and condition of things. Consider how to mitigate to minimize property damages for emergencies and events. Practice your family emergency plans. Utilize existing alert and warning systems in your area. Assist with your neighborhood and community preparedness and recovery efforts.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:2359ba1b-2972-4184-a07e-cd0d00a888d7>"]}]}

In all, 4.4 million people require medical attention each year as a result of a road accident. it goes without saying that the more safety features a vehicle has, the better chance you and your passengers have against injury in the event of a crash. With modern advances in technology, driving has become much safer. Keep reading to find out three new car safety features that should be essential for your next vehicle. 1. AEB: Automatic Emergency Braking\nAEB or Automatic Emergency Braking has become more sought after in recent years, as modern advances happen in the automotive industry. A vehicle that has AEB fitted will automatically sense a potential collision, and if the driver does not react in time, the car will do the braking on your behalf. A driver will find that in the event of a collision, the car will be able to commence braking before the driver has even had time to react, drastically reducing the severity of the collision itself. 2. The Rear-View Camera\nThere are two main benefits to having a rear-view camera on your car:\n- The driver gets a clear view of anything that is behind the vehicle while reversing\n- The rear-view camera can detect objects, people, or animals that are too short to be seen over the backend of the car\nThese rear-view cameras usually have a 180-degree backward view, so a driver will be able to see on the screen any obstructions behind them. 3. Futuristic Facial Recognition\nVery recently, some car manufacturers have revealed vehicles that have facial recognition software installed. What does this mean? Well, the facial recognition software has the ability to constantly measure the driver’s alertness, as well as give warnings when it feels that the driver isn’t paying enough attention. The warning comes in the form of a buzzer with the objective of bringing the driver’s attention back to the wheel. Bonus New Car Safety Features\nCar safety features come in the form of many vehicle advancements, particularly in recent years. Some of these we feel are worthy of a special mention:\n- Smart headlights have the ability to lower the level of the light beam when it senses oncoming traffic, so other drivers aren’t ‘blinded’\n- Night vision features are also available that will serve as a warning system for pedestrians and cyclists that aren’t easily seen at night\nIf you do find yourself in the difficult position of having recently had a road collision, make sure you’re up to scratch with the requirements and things that need to be done. Sweet Law is an organization that can assist with this. Shopping For New Car Safety Features\nWhen you’re in the market for a new vehicle, new car safety features should be top of the list of what you need to look at. You can also look for things like forward-collision warning systems, shatter-resistant glass, and airbags, all of which are dated technology, but coupled with new advancements can make your new vehicle as safe as possible.

When you get behind the wheel of your car, you’re effectively putting your life in the metaphorical hands of a machine. That’s why it’s so important that you choose a car that’s both safe and reliable. Although boring, practical features like airbags aren’t always top of mind when we draw up our wish list of features for a new car, they should be! Our cars have come a long way in terms of safety\nEarly car models didn’t come equipped with safety features like airbags and passive safety technology. Take a look at these crash test dummies taking a beating in safety tests during the 1950’s. Feeling nervous? Don’t panic, car safety has come a long way since our grandparents’ days. In the past, cars were built to survive a collision. Reinforced metal panels were designed to be as stiff as possible in an effort to avoid your car wrapping around a light pole like tin foil around last night’s leftovers. Little did they know…\nTurns out, you actually need your car to crumple up like that. This rigidity might make the panel beater's job a little easier - but it led to drivers and passengers being flung around like confetti, due to the kinetic force generated by the impact. Nowadays, the opposite is true. Thanks to modern technology, like crumple zones, we’re able to sacrifice your vehicle - allowing you to survive the collision instead. What on earth are crumple zones? In a nutshell, a crumple zone is a deliberately designed weak point on your vehicle, which is intended to buckle in a specific area upon impact. How does this protect the driver and their passengers? Well, crumple zones are cleverly engineered to absorb a large portion of the kinetic energy that results from a collision. Depending on the shape, size and manufacturer of your vehicle, these crumple zones can vary from simple segmented crumple zones, to using a variety of metals and intricate honeycomb designs (which are stiffer under normal conditions, but collapse easily in a crash). What other safety features do modern cars have to protect their drivers? Modern cars have various passive and active safety systems to keep you and your loved ones safe. Some cars are even smart enough to predict accidents, and alert the driver before a collision occurs. Did you know the Suzuki Vitara was first in its class to be awarded a five star safety rating from European New Car Assessment Programme (NCAP)? The NCAP five star rating is reserved for cars which provide the greatest collision protection for both passengers and pedestrians. The NCAP tests put vehicles through rigorous testing, so every star is extremely valuable! When you’re weighing up the safety features in a vehicle, some of the top features to look out for are:\n- Airbags - at least one for both the driver and a passenger. - Anti-lock braking system (ABS) - which prevents your wheels from locking, and gives you the ability to steer during hard braking. - Electronic brake force distribution (EBD) - which automatically varies pressure applied to each wheel, depending on the road conditions, to allow maximum stopping power and control. - Adaptive headlights shine their beams in the direction of a curve, giving you better vision at night and in poor visibility, around bends in the road. - Central locking. - SIPS or Side Impact Protection System is the name of a system to protect against injury in a side collision. - Seat belts with pretensioners, To make sure a seatbelt restrains an occupant as early as possible in a crash. - As well as load limiters, to help protect occupants from seatbelt-inflicted injury. Your infotainment system won’t save your life - but those airbags sure could. Your life is precious, don’t forfeit safety in favour of the nice-to-haves. Is your child learning to drive? Or maybe they’ve just passed their driver’s test. Chances are they’re begging you for their own set of wheels. Download the ebook, Guide to buying your child their first car, to help you navigate the inevitable debate over reliability and the ever coveted “cool” factors.\n\nWhen it comes to today’s SUVs, cars, trucks, and minivans, electronic tech features are hugely important. These items are now an integral part of how you interact with your vehicle, as well as how your vehicle interacts with the cars around it on the road. They range from safety and security measures to communication and connectivity features. We’ve put together a list of the best automotive technologies to look for when buying a new car. Some of them serve as safety shields that you will hopefully never need to use, but you can take comfort knowing they’re there. Others assist with parking and visibility. And some of this tech helps you stay connected to friends and family, or quickly contact emergency services. When you shop for a vehicle with these features, the ideal ones make things easier without causing driver distraction. Here is our list of the best automotive technologies of 2022. 1. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems\nThis is a category of systems that can ensure that you know when a vehicle is in your blind spot, can keep you a safe distance from the car in front of you, and can keep your vehicle from drifting into another lane. One of the first examples of an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) was anti-lock brakes. These are now standard equipment on every new car. In modern vehicles, there are now dozens of these systems. These advanced driver assist systems often come in bundled safety suites. Some examples are Toyota\nSafety Sense, Subaru\nEyeSight, Ford CoPilot360, Honda\nSensing, and Nissan\nSafety Shield 360. Even if a model you are shopping for doesn’t have ADAS as a bundle or suite of features, many automakers sell them as standalone options or include them as part of a specific trim level. Key features to look for\nAdaptive cruise control\nIn some ways, adaptive control is similar to regular cruise control. However, while adaptive cruise control also keeps your vehicle at a set speed, additionally it slows down or accelerates to keep a safe distance from the car in front of you. This uses sensors on the vehicle to detect if there is a vehicle in your blind spot. It signals that there’s a vehicle there with an alert on your side mirrors. Some pickup trucks also have a blind-spot alert that takes into account vehicles that are next to either side of your trailer while you tow. If you are trying to back out of a parking space and you can’t see around the vehicles on either side, rear cross-traffic alert will let you know if a vehicle is approaching. This system often uses radar units on the vehicle to detect cross traffic. In some cases, you’ll hear an alert and see arrows on the center screen that show from which direction the other car is coming. Front cross-traffic alert is especially handy when you’re exiting a blind alley or driveway. Some newer systems also prevent you from turning left across traffic if it senses a vehicle is in your path. Forward collision warning\/avoidance\nForward collision warning (FCW) senses if you are at risk of a potential collision with the vehicle ahead of you. Some systems can sense if there is a pending collision a few vehicles ahead. FCW can make sounds, flash display lights, or provide a tactile change to the way the steering wheel or brake pedal feels. Forward collision avoidance uses the FCW sensors and, if the driver doesn’t react quickly enough, adds automatic emergency braking to stop the vehicle. This feature will alert you if your vehicle starts drifting into another lane. If your vehicle does start to drift into another lane, lane-keep assist uses steering to keep your car in the lane. If your vehicle drifts into oncoming traffic, some systems will also use steering to get back onto the correct side of the road. Reverse brake assist\nIf this system senses an object behind your vehicle while backing up, reverse brake assist can use automatic emergency braking to stop your car, avoiding a collision. 2. Automatic emergency braking\nAs you can see from the examples above, automatic emergency braking is an essential part of safety tech. When the car senses that a collision is imminent, AEB activates your car’s brakes, potentially avoiding or minimizing an accident. AEB can react faster than a person and can start working before you hit the brakes. If you are braking and it senses you need to stop sooner, AEB can also brake harder than the pressure you’re applying.\n\nDamadian was looking at years wasted on a failed invention, but one of his colleagues bravely suggested that he might be too big for the machine a svelte.

In all, 4.4 million people require medical attention each year as a result of a road accident. it goes without saying that the more safety features a vehicle has, the better chance you and your passengers have against injury in the event of a crash. With modern advances in technology, driving has become much safer. Keep reading to find out three new car safety features that should be essential for your next vehicle. 1. AEB: Automatic Emergency Braking\nAEB or Automatic Emergency Braking has become more sought after in recent years, as modern advances happen in the automotive industry. A vehicle that has AEB fitted will automatically sense a potential collision, and if the driver does not react in time, the car will do the braking on your behalf. A driver will find that in the event of a collision, the car will be able to commence braking before the driver has even had time to react, drastically reducing the severity of the collision itself. 2. The Rear-View Camera\nThere are two main benefits to having a rear-view camera on your car:\n- The driver gets a clear view of anything that is behind the vehicle while reversing\n- The rear-view camera can detect objects, people, or animals that are too short to be seen over the backend of the car\nThese rear-view cameras usually have a 180-degree backward view, so a driver will be able to see on the screen any obstructions behind them. 3. Futuristic Facial Recognition\nVery recently, some car manufacturers have revealed vehicles that have facial recognition software installed. What does this mean? Well, the facial recognition software has the ability to constantly measure the driver’s alertness, as well as give warnings when it feels that the driver isn’t paying enough attention. The warning comes in the form of a buzzer with the objective of bringing the driver’s attention back to the wheel. Bonus New Car Safety Features\nCar safety features come in the form of many vehicle advancements, particularly in recent years. Some of these we feel are worthy of a special mention:\n- Smart headlights have the ability to lower the level of the light beam when it senses oncoming traffic, so other drivers aren’t ‘blinded’\n- Night vision features are also available that will serve as a warning system for pedestrians and cyclists that aren’t easily seen at night\nIf you do find yourself in the difficult position of having recently had a road collision, make sure you’re up to scratch with the requirements and things that need to be done. Sweet Law is an organization that can assist with this. Shopping For New Car Safety Features\nWhen you’re in the market for a new vehicle, new car safety features should be top of the list of what you need to look at. You can also look for things like forward-collision warning systems, shatter-resistant glass, and airbags, all of which are dated technology, but coupled with new advancements can make your new vehicle as safe as possible.

Take a look at some of the ways that your car keeps you safe in the event of a collision. When you get behind the wheel of your car, you’re effectively putting your life in the metaphorical hands of a machine. That’s why it’s so important that you choose a car that’s both safe and reliable. Although boring, practical features like airbags aren’t always top of mind when we draw up our wish list of features for a new car, they should be! Our cars have come a long way in terms of safety\nEarly car models didn’t come equipped with safety features like airbags and passive safety technology. Take a look at these crash test dummies taking a beating in safety tests during the 1950’s. Feeling nervous? Don’t panic, car safety has come a long way since our grandparents’ days. In the past, cars were built to survive a collision. Reinforced metal panels were designed to be as stiff as possible in an effort to avoid your car wrapping around a light pole like tin foil around last night’s leftovers. Little did they know…\nTurns out, you actually need your car to crumple up like that. This rigidity might make the panel beater's job a little easier - but it led to drivers and passengers being flung around like confetti, due to the kinetic force generated by the impact. Nowadays, the opposite is true. Thanks to modern technology, like crumple zones, we’re able to sacrifice your vehicle - allowing you to survive the collision instead. What on earth are crumple zones? In a nutshell, a crumple zone is a deliberately designed weak point on your vehicle, which is intended to buckle in a specific area upon impact. How does this protect the driver and their passengers? Well, crumple zones are cleverly engineered to absorb a large portion of the kinetic energy that results from a collision. Depending on the shape, size and manufacturer of your vehicle, these crumple zones can vary from simple segmented crumple zones, to using a variety of metals and intricate honeycomb designs (which are stiffer under normal conditions, but collapse easily in a crash). What other safety features do modern cars have to protect their drivers? Modern cars have various passive and active safety systems to keep you and your loved ones safe. Some cars are even smart enough to predict accidents, and alert the driver before a collision occurs. Did you know the Suzuki Vitara was first in its class to be awarded a five star safety rating from European New Car Assessment Programme (NCAP)? The NCAP five star rating is reserved for cars which provide the greatest collision protection for both passengers and pedestrians. The NCAP tests put vehicles through rigorous testing, so every star is extremely valuable! When you’re weighing up the safety features in a vehicle, some of the top features to look out for are:\n- Airbags - at least one for both the driver and a passenger. - Anti-lock braking system (ABS) - which prevents your wheels from locking, and gives you the ability to steer during hard braking. - Electronic brake force distribution (EBD) - which automatically varies pressure applied to each wheel, depending on the road conditions, to allow maximum stopping power and control. - Adaptive headlights shine their beams in the direction of a curve, giving you better vision at night and in poor visibility, around bends in the road. - Central locking. - SIPS or Side Impact Protection System is the name of a system to protect against injury in a side collision. - Seat belts with pretensioners, To make sure a seatbelt restrains an occupant as early as possible in a crash. - As well as load limiters, to help protect occupants from seatbelt-inflicted injury. Your infotainment system won’t save your life - but those airbags sure could. Your life is precious, don’t forfeit safety in favour of the nice-to-haves. Is your child learning to drive? Or maybe they’ve just passed their driver’s test. Chances are they’re begging you for their own set of wheels. Download the ebook, Guide to buying your child their first car, to help you navigate the inevitable debate over reliability and the ever coveted “cool” factors.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:c668da79-660d-47e2-bb94-98841bcc049d>"]},{"passage":"When it comes to today’s SUVs, cars, trucks, and minivans, electronic tech features are hugely important. These items are now an integral part of how you interact with your vehicle, as well as how your vehicle interacts with the cars around it on the road. They range from safety and security measures to communication and connectivity features. We’ve put together a list of the best automotive technologies to look for when buying a new car. Some of them serve as safety shields that you will hopefully never need to use, but you can take comfort knowing they’re there. Others assist with parking and visibility. And some of this tech helps you stay connected to friends and family, or quickly contact emergency services. When you shop for a vehicle with these features, the ideal ones make things easier without causing driver distraction. Here is our list of the best automotive technologies of 2022. 1. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems\nThis is a category of systems that can ensure that you know when a vehicle is in your blind spot, can keep you a safe distance from the car in front of you, and can keep your vehicle from drifting into another lane. One of the first examples of an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) was anti-lock brakes. These are now standard equipment on every new car. In modern vehicles, there are now dozens of these systems. These advanced driver assist systems often come in bundled safety suites. Some examples are Toyota\nSafety Sense, Subaru\nEyeSight, Ford CoPilot360, Honda\nSensing, and Nissan\nSafety Shield 360. Even if a model you are shopping for doesn’t have ADAS as a bundle or suite of features, many automakers sell them as standalone options or include them as part of a specific trim level. Key features to look for\nAdaptive cruise control\nIn some ways, adaptive control is similar to regular cruise control. However, while adaptive cruise control also keeps your vehicle at a set speed, additionally it slows down or accelerates to keep a safe distance from the car in front of you. This uses sensors on the vehicle to detect if there is a vehicle in your blind spot. It signals that there’s a vehicle there with an alert on your side mirrors. Some pickup trucks also have a blind-spot alert that takes into account vehicles that are next to either side of your trailer while you tow. If you are trying to back out of a parking space and you can’t see around the vehicles on either side, rear cross-traffic alert will let you know if a vehicle is approaching. This system often uses radar units on the vehicle to detect cross traffic. In some cases, you’ll hear an alert and see arrows on the center screen that show from which direction the other car is coming. Front cross-traffic alert is especially handy when you’re exiting a blind alley or driveway. Some newer systems also prevent you from turning left across traffic if it senses a vehicle is in your path. Forward collision warning\/avoidance\nForward collision warning (FCW) senses if you are at risk of a potential collision with the vehicle ahead of you. Some systems can sense if there is a pending collision a few vehicles ahead. FCW can make sounds, flash display lights, or provide a tactile change to the way the steering wheel or brake pedal feels. Forward collision avoidance uses the FCW sensors and, if the driver doesn’t react quickly enough, adds automatic emergency braking to stop the vehicle. This feature will alert you if your vehicle starts drifting into another lane. If your vehicle does start to drift into another lane, lane-keep assist uses steering to keep your car in the lane. If your vehicle drifts into oncoming traffic, some systems will also use steering to get back onto the correct side of the road. Reverse brake assist\nIf this system senses an object behind your vehicle while backing up, reverse brake assist can use automatic emergency braking to stop your car, avoiding a collision. 2. Automatic emergency braking\nAs you can see from the examples above, automatic emergency braking is an essential part of safety tech. When the car senses that a collision is imminent, AEB activates your car’s brakes, potentially avoiding or minimizing an accident. AEB can react faster than a person and can start working before you hit the brakes. If you are braking and it senses you need to stop sooner, AEB can also brake harder than the pressure you’re applying.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:4daee723-85f3-446d-9bc0-a4a57a911aab>"]},{"passage":"Damadian was looking at years wasted on a failed invention, but one of his colleagues bravely suggested that he might be too big for the machine a svelte.

Uncover the dark history of the city through the nightmarish tales of your guide. Begin near Congo Square, the birthplace of jazz and New Orleans voodoo, and hear about the square's darker side. Partake of elixirs, leave offerings of baubles and beads, and pray its enough to keep the demons of New Orleans from leaving you in a spiraling quagmire of insanity. Raven’s Omen will burn through the hottest hell as it sends the chill of death to your soul. Unearth the Devil’s Empire and feel its lifeless grip as the pulse of New Orleans sends you further into the shadows. Is it voodoo posession, madness, or PTSD? Hear the story of Zack and Addie to find out. First time doing something like this and it was a blast!! We had a great guide and it was lots of fun with spooky stories. 6. New Orleans Lunch & Lesson: Cajun & Creole Cooking Class\nLearn the basics of Louisiana Cooking with cajun and creole chefs teaching New Orleans specialties such as Gumbo, Jambalaya and Pralines, seasoning them with history, trivia and tall tales.

Follow along and learn how to make mouth-watering creole and cajun dishes and dig in after the class. At the end of the class, you will receive a coupon to use in the general store and are encouraged to go home and try to make the dishes yourselves. The general store, as well as the classroom, are both located in a renovated molasses warehouse built in the early 1800s in the heart of the French Quarter. The store has a thoughtful collection of the best locally sourced products and is the home of the famous Joe's Stuff Creole Seasoning, used and loved by local chefs and visitors alike. Program of...\nGREAT EXPERIENCE GREAT INSTRUCTOR AND CREW GREAT GREAT THE FOODDD WAS DELICIOUS AND YOU LEARN SOMETHING\n7. New Orleans: French Quarter Saint & Sinner History Tour\nFrom the beginning faith has ruled this great city. For some, it has created rumors of conspiracy, witchcraft, and vampires. For others, it inspired greatness. Lives have been lost and battlegrounds drawn, but New Orleans’ eclectic belief systems have created a sense of acceptance found nowhere else. Did you know that the famous voodoo priestess, Marie Laveau, was also a devout Catholic? Surprises abound on this inspiring journey. Join the most unique and interesting walking tour in New Orleans. New Orleans is a hot, humid and sometimes unforgiving place where in the dead of summer the air takes on the quality of a crawfish boil. It is a long, drawn out fever that seeps into the bloodstream and compels even the sweetest from small town America to do obscene things. This is the real New Orleans which does not fit neatly into the category of \"American\" city. It is a black water port, Cari... It was a fun tour not everything was absolutely the truth but entertaining guide was fun. 8. New Orleans: French Quarter Secrets and Bourbon Street Tour\nYour tour begins on Bourbon Street where you’ll meet your local expert guide. Set off to learn how this area developed from a seedy slum into one of the preeminent pleasure districts in the United States. You will also swing into a bar to learn about (and enjoy too if you wish) one of the many cocktails created in the French Quarter, before pausing on Royal Street to see some of the best street musicians in America and learn about the creation of Jazz music. From there, your guide will take you to Jackson Square where you’ll see landmark buildings like the Pontalba apartments (the oldest continually-occupied apartments in America), the St. Louis Cathedral, and the Cabildo (where the Louisiana Purchase was signed). You will then step inside the Presbytere for a guided tour of the interior, including exhibits on Mardi Gras and Hurricane Katrina. You can’t visit New Orleans without a clos...\nNice little tour to see a lot of the \"off the beaten path\" areas.\n\nMaybe it’s the city or maybe it’s the spirits that got me to go on a haunted tour in New Orleans. While I was sitting at Lafitte’s Blacksmith Shop, the oldest bar in the United States located on Bourbon Street in the French Quarters of New Orleans. The 18th-century architecture and the liquor aroused my fantasies of what it was like back in the day. How would the ladies and gents be dressed? What was their story? How could I learn more about those spirits, the ghost of New Orleans’s past? I checked TripAdvisor on my phone for Ghost Tours in New Orleans and that’s where I found a really good deal: The New Orleans Ghost, Voodoo and Vampire Tour. Spooky! There I was sitting at Lafitte’s Blacksmith Shop and I found the perfect ghost tour in New Orleans. That particular New Orleans haunted tour was going to tell me more about Lafitte’s Blacksmith shop. The spirits were working on me in more ways than one. I considered it a sign and I registered to take the ghost tour of New Orleans adventure. Spoil alert, I’m not going to tell you all about the ghost tour…\nbut sightings have it that there is a tall man with long, dark hair seen standing in a back room at Lafitte’s Blacksmith Shop. The haunted tour history of that place is rich and you’ll learn about Caribbean pirates, Andrew Jackson, and the battle of New Orleans. You’ve got to take this New Orleans ghost tour. Another scary detail involves Lafitte’s guest house and a little girl seen by visitors in a mirror. It’s freaky! It’ll make you afraid of things that go bump in the night. The ghost tour guides explain in detail how and why it happens. You don’t want to miss that New Orleans ghost tour story either. Warning, mirrors in New Orleans can be creepy. Believe me, I had so much fun and enjoyed my visit so much more because I took the ghost tour in New Orleans. It’s family friendly and the Witches Brew ghost tour guides are the best in the business. Make reservations for your haunted tours of New Orleans today. The spirits are calling.\n\nBelieve it or not, there are a ton of unique things to do in New Orleans, Louisiana. This city has much more to offer than just parties and Bourbon Street, and its party reputation hardly does NOLA justice. New Orleans is one of the oldest cities in America, with a fascinating French and Creole history. It’s the setting for young adult novels and movies like “Interview with a Vampire.”\nIf you’re a fan of literature, architecture, history or just up for getting a good scare, read on for my top picks of what to do in the city. 1) Go to the WWII Museum\nThe World War II museum is five buildings and holds one of the most extensive collections of World War II Memorabilia in the world. It’s possible to spend multiple days here given how much there is to see. I recommend you set aside a minimum of 3-4 hours for your visit. If you decide to come back, make sure to save your ticket as you get reduced admission on subsequent days. When you enter you are given dog tags to follow one soldier’s story throughout the exhibits. The displays are very personal, revealing humanizing details about the person whose items you see in a glass case. The visit can be very emotional so prepare yourself. There’s a movie that has an introduction by Tom Hanks and special effects throughout, like shaking seats and real airplanes being lifted up into the air. It’s worth paying extra to see the movie. 2) Visit Oak Alley and Laura Plantation\nYou need a car to go to Oak Alley and Laura Plantations but it’s well worth the journey. Oak Alley Plantation (pictured above) is said to have the prettiest view in Louisiana — the stunning walkway of massive oak trees. You can tour the premises and drink mint juleps at the restaurant on site. Laura Plantation is just a few miles away and is a great complement to Oak Alley since it’s a Creole Plantation. It’s brightly colored, which is how the boats on the Mississippi River identified the plantation when making their deliveries. The guided tour explains the history of the property and its namesake owner and is included with the price of admission. 3) Take a haunted walking tour of the city\nGhost lovers, vampire seekers and general fans of the paranormal will get a kick out of taking a haunted walking tour of the city. I went with Witches Brew Tours and had a great time. Our guide was very knowledgeable and told us tales that brought the city to life. Make no mistake about it — New Orleans has a dark history. From serial killers to murder\/suicides, there are plenty of creepy and gory details to give even the biggest skeptic a case of the heebie-jeebies. I recommend that you check for deals on Groupon or Living Social to get a discount on your booking, and wear comfortable shoes. 4) Listen to music on Frenchmen Street\nIf you want to catch live jazz music, Frenchmen Street is the place to be. It’s a favorite of locals and retains an authentic vibe despite the secret long being out on this space. We saw a great band with a skilled trumpet player on the second floor of Blue Nile, but my favorite is Bamboulas. I was there on Friday night and the band was outstanding, with people stopping in the streets to dance outside and look in through the windows. The party can go all night long on Frenchmen Street and with $6 drink specials and generally no cover except for special events, this is a great place to come, unwind and have a musical evening. 5) Tour the Garden District\nHave you ever seen “American Horror Story: Coven?” The Buckner Mansion in The Garden District is also known as Miss Robichaux’s Academy for Exceptional Young Ladies. The Garden District is where you’ll find New Orleans nicest houses, making this an essential stop for architecture lovers. You can reach the district by streetcar, just take the St. Charles route. Note that you need cash to ride the streetcar and they don’t always stop for new riders. Note to AHS fans: Madame LaLaurie’s home and torture chamber is also a real place and a popular stop on haunted walking tours. 6) Eat authentic New Orleans food\nIf there’s one thing you should do in New Orleans, it’s eat. For the best jambalaya, I recommend Coops Place where you’ll get a dish that’s hearty, tasty and doesn’t break the bank.\n\nI’ve taken a look at some of the ‘frightseeing’ tours on Flight Centre’s website that are guaranteed to send a shiver up (or down) your spine. Here are my personal favourites:\n- New Orleans Ghost Tour\nThe Big Easy is often referred to as ‘the most haunted city in the USA’ and after a two-hour walk through the city you may be inclined to agree. New Orleans has enjoyed a colourful history that encompasses ghosts, vampires and voodoo. The tour includes a visit to a haunted bar. - Concrete Shoes on the Vegas Mob Tour\nTake a two-hour tour to discover the fascinating history of Las Vegas. Made famous by colourful characters of dubious reputation (think Bugsy Siegel and Anthony ‘the Ant’ Spilotro) Sin City is only 75 years old but has been built on skimming, suicide, murders and general underworld activities giving rise to an interesting reputation. - Creepy Beasties in Edinburgh\nTake a look at Edinburgh’s dark side, including tales of witchcraft, plague and torture. Visit the dark scenes of mayhem, horrific torture murders and supernatural happenings as you walk along eerie alleyways and creepy courtyards of the old Town. Beware of the “jumper-ooters”!!! - Scandalous Sydney\nEver wanted to ride in a haunted Cadillac hearse? Discover Sydney’s bizarre and bloody past, oozing with convicts, crime scenes, sex, drugs and rock ‘n roll, scandals, celebrities and much more. This “Weird Sydney” history and ghost tour is informative and will tell you everything you need to know about the famous and infamous who shaped the city. These tours are guaranteed to leave you with some spine chilling memories. Have you done any spooky tours around the world? I’d love to hear from you if you have.\n\nNew Orleans tours are exceedingly popular due in large part to the fact there is just too much to see in this city in one or two week’s time. Arranging tours of the places and attractions that you want to see will help you to make the most of your experience in New Orleans. If you are traveling to New Orleans specifically for massive events like Mardi Gras or the Jazz and Heritage Festival, then you may already have your itinerary pretty well filled. If, however, you are traveling to the city in a non-peak time, you may want to begin looking into which tours are available. Many times you can even save money by booking certain tours along with your hotel accommodations. From New Orleans ghost tours to New Orleans walking tours there is something to peak just about everyone’s excitement in the Big Easy. Tours in New Orleans\nNew Orleans ghost tours are some of the most popular because of the enigmatic nature of the program—what will happen and will the tour actually see a ghost? The answer is that the New Orleans ghost tours are more theater than anything else, but do give tourists a glimpse inside the areas of the city which are claimed to be haunted and where ghost sightings are rumored to have taken place. Every evening from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., New Orleans ghost tours are moderated by master storytellers that take guests on walking tours of the French Quarter. You also have the option of taking one of the interesting cemetery tours that give you access to the European inspired and longstanding places of rest such as St. Louis Cemetery and more. New Orleans bike tours are another great way to check out the city and get to all of the attractions you are interested in seeing at your own speed. There are a variety of providers that offer a range of tours and services. One such provider offers New Orleans bike tours that last for three hours and take you around to some of the most significant historical sights, with the aim of giving riders some real insights into the composition of the city. Most of the New Orleans bike tours are meant to be fun as well as informative. You can choose from ones that take you to popular attractions like the cemeteries, French Market, Garden District, and more, or from journeys that cruise the most notable music venues, art galleries, and other such tailored experiences. Amongst New Orleans tours, those that take people deep into the swamp are also very popular. On the amazing New Orleans swamp tours you are whistled off into the bayou to witness not only authentic Cajun folk living in the swamp, but also a seemingly inexhaustible variety of wildlife. At a place like the Barataria Swamps and Wetlands, you will see a ton of alligators, and even have the chance of witnessing the majestic bald eagle. These are extremely popular New Orleans tours for photographers and lovers of nature who get unrivaled opportunities to snap shots of the gorgeous swamps. From New Orleans bike tours to the swamp to the cemeteries, there is something for everyone to see on their ideal tour in the Big Easy.\n\nHappy Mardi Gras! Laissez les bon temps rouler! I thought it’d be fun to explore the most haunted Fat Tuesday\/Carnival cities that I could find. Dare to join me? Let’s indulge…\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\nI think it’s safe to say that the first place that probably pops to most people’s minds if they live in the U.S. and hear “Mardi Gras” is New Orleans. As for haunted places? Yep. New Orleans is loaded with those too. In the French Quarter alone you can find a concentration of New Orleans’ most haunted places. I’m talking haunted hotels, haunted restaurants, even haunted cemeteries! Just a few of the many popular haunted hotels include the Andrew Jackson Hotel, Omni Royal Orleans Hotel, and\nBourbon Orleans Hotel. You’ll find everything from the ghosts of Confederate soldiers, a ghost maid who tucks guests in, and the ghosts of children who died in a fire. Ghosts aren’t the only haunting things you might encounter in this city either. Be on the lookout for vampires. As Stephen P. Unger once wrote in a guest post here, New Orleans’ vampire scene has been active for many, many decades. Centuries even. Ever since the city was first established. Anne Rice certainly had a lot to draw from for her beloved novels. And if you want to take a Mardi Gras, ghost, or vampire tour, Viator offers a bunch, such as:\n- Mardi Gras World: Behind-the-Scenes Tour in New Orleans\n- Mardi Gras Walking Tour in New Orleans\n- New Orleans Ghost Adventure\n- Murder in New Orleans Ghost Tour\n- New Orleans Haunted History Ghost Tour\n- New Orleans Ghosts and Spirits Walking Tour\n- French Quarter Haunted Excursion In New Orleans\n- New Orleans Supernatural Tour\n- New Orleans Voodoo Mystery and Paranormal Tour\n- French Quarter Walking Ghost Tour of New Orleans\n- Haunted History Of New Orleans\n- Ghostly Galavant New Orleans\n- New Orleans Vampire Tour\nRio de Janeiro, Brazil\nAnother huge Mardi Gras –or, rather, Carnival— hot spot is Brazil’s Rio. As for being haunted…well, that’s not among its claims to fame. There are a lot of haunting stories about the real life struggles of living there (especially in the favelas), but no real ghost accounts like what I’m looking for. However, it’s such an iconic Mardi Gras destination that to not include it would be blasphemous. So I searched hard and came up with one haunted place to share. Not far from Rio is the Imperial Museum in Petropolis. (It’s also known as the Petropolis Museum.) Allegedly the ghost of Emperor Dom Pedros II haunts its garden. (It used to be the Emperor’s favorite residence.) Viator even offers a tour there:\nAnother iconic Carnival hot spot is Venice. Mysterious, beguiling, and enchanting, this Italian City of Love is famous for its canals, culture and architecture. But it does possess a dark side. And seems to have its fair share of curses. (Which caught my eye, because of my recently released Shadow People and Cursed Objects: 13 Tales of Terror Based on True Stories…or are they? anthology.) Some feel sure that the Cà Dario, or Palazzo Dario, is cursed. After all, death has befallen all who have owned it. The Casin degli spiriti is a palace that is also regarded as a cursed location. It includes tales ranging from spirit and demon-invoking religious sects who practiced there to a heartbroken suicidal ghost who still roams there. Fishermen won’t fish in that lagoon because of a horrible murder in the 1950s where the killer chopped the victim’s body up before throwing the remains in those waters. And then there’s the very creepy Poveglia Island. Another place fisherman don’t dare go near for fear it’s cursed. It’s a 10 minute ferry ride from Venice and was home to Black Death victims during the plague epidemic. Centuries later it became a psychiatric hospital run by a doctor who tortured the patients. He went mad himself and committed suicide after claiming to be haunted by the island’s ghosts. 160,000 deaths are said to have occurred there.\n\nDid you schedule a guided tour - 9\/11 Memorial and Museum at Ground Zero Free Tours\nWo95\/3919)34 Pieces of YouThe Mystery Fancier (Vol. 4 No. 6) A Guided Tour for BeginnersThe Night Sky Observers Guide - Page 3.

For others, it inspired greatness. Lives have been lost and battlegrounds drawn, but New Orleans’ eclectic belief systems have created a sense of acceptance found nowhere else. Did you know that the famous voodoo priestess, Marie Laveau, was also a devout Catholic? Surprises abound on this inspiring journey. Join the most unique and interesting walking tour in New Orleans. New Orleans is a hot, humid and sometimes unforgiving place where in the dead of summer the air takes on the quality of a crawfish boil. It is a long, drawn out fever that seeps into the bloodstream and compels even the sweetest from small town America to do obscene things. This is the real New Orleans which does not fit neatly into the category of \"American\" city. It is a black water port, Cari... It was a fun tour not everything was absolutely the truth but entertaining guide was fun. 8. New Orleans: French Quarter Secrets and Bourbon Street Tour\nYour tour begins on Bourbon Street where you’ll meet your local expert guide. Set off to learn how this area developed from a seedy slum into one of the preeminent pleasure districts in the United States. You will also swing into a bar to learn about (and enjoy too if you wish) one of the many cocktails created in the French Quarter, before pausing on Royal Street to see some of the best street musicians in America and learn about the creation of Jazz music. From there, your guide will take you to Jackson Square where you’ll see landmark buildings like the Pontalba apartments (the oldest continually-occupied apartments in America), the St. Louis Cathedral, and the Cabildo (where the Louisiana Purchase was signed). You will then step inside the Presbytere for a guided tour of the interior, including exhibits on Mardi Gras and Hurricane Katrina.

While I was sitting at Lafitte’s Blacksmith Shop, the oldest bar in the United States located on Bourbon Street in the French Quarters of New Orleans. The 18th-century architecture and the liquor aroused my fantasies of what it was like back in the day. How would the ladies and gents be dressed? What was their story? How could I learn more about those spirits, the ghost of New Orleans’s past? I checked TripAdvisor on my phone for Ghost Tours in New Orleans and that’s where I found a really good deal: The New Orleans Ghost, Voodoo and Vampire Tour. Spooky! There I was sitting at Lafitte’s Blacksmith Shop and I found the perfect ghost tour in New Orleans. That particular New Orleans haunted tour was going to tell me more about Lafitte’s Blacksmith shop. The spirits were working on me in more ways than one. I considered it a sign and I registered to take the ghost tour of New Orleans adventure. Spoil alert, I’m not going to tell you all about the ghost tour…\nbut sightings have it that there is a tall man with long, dark hair seen standing in a back room at Lafitte’s Blacksmith Shop. The haunted tour history of that place is rich and you’ll learn about Caribbean pirates, Andrew Jackson, and the battle of New Orleans. You’ve got to take this New Orleans ghost tour. Another scary detail involves Lafitte’s guest house and a little girl seen by visitors in a mirror. It’s freaky! It’ll make you afraid of things that go bump in the night. The ghost tour guides explain in detail how and why it happens. You don’t want to miss that New Orleans ghost tour story either. Warning, mirrors in New Orleans can be creepy. Believe me, I had so much fun and enjoyed my visit so much more because I took the ghost tour in New Orleans. It’s family friendly and the Witches Brew ghost tour guides are the best in the business. Make reservations for your haunted tours of New Orleans today. The spirits are calling.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:d801b081-ad70-4c21-8dd7-df726960df8b>"]},{"passage":"Believe it or not, there are a ton of unique things to do in New Orleans, Louisiana. This city has much more to offer than just parties and Bourbon Street, and its party reputation hardly does NOLA justice. New Orleans is one of the oldest cities in America, with a fascinating French and Creole history. It’s the setting for young adult novels and movies like “Interview with a Vampire.”\nIf you’re a fan of literature, architecture, history or just up for getting a good scare, read on for my top picks of what to do in the city. 1) Go to the WWII Museum\nThe World War II museum is five buildings and holds one of the most extensive collections of World War II Memorabilia in the world. It’s possible to spend multiple days here given how much there is to see. I recommend you set aside a minimum of 3-4 hours for your visit. If you decide to come back, make sure to save your ticket as you get reduced admission on subsequent days. When you enter you are given dog tags to follow one soldier’s story throughout the exhibits. The displays are very personal, revealing humanizing details about the person whose items you see in a glass case. The visit can be very emotional so prepare yourself. There’s a movie that has an introduction by Tom Hanks and special effects throughout, like shaking seats and real airplanes being lifted up into the air. It’s worth paying extra to see the movie. 2) Visit Oak Alley and Laura Plantation\nYou need a car to go to Oak Alley and Laura Plantations but it’s well worth the journey. Oak Alley Plantation (pictured above) is said to have the prettiest view in Louisiana — the stunning walkway of massive oak trees. You can tour the premises and drink mint juleps at the restaurant on site. Laura Plantation is just a few miles away and is a great complement to Oak Alley since it’s a Creole Plantation. It’s brightly colored, which is how the boats on the Mississippi River identified the plantation when making their deliveries. The guided tour explains the history of the property and its namesake owner and is included with the price of admission. 3) Take a haunted walking tour of the city\nGhost lovers, vampire seekers and general fans of the paranormal will get a kick out of taking a haunted walking tour of the city. I went with Witches Brew Tours and had a great time. Our guide was very knowledgeable and told us tales that brought the city to life. Make no mistake about it — New Orleans has a dark history. From serial killers to murder\/suicides, there are plenty of creepy and gory details to give even the biggest skeptic a case of the heebie-jeebies. I recommend that you check for deals on Groupon or Living Social to get a discount on your booking, and wear comfortable shoes. 4) Listen to music on Frenchmen Street\nIf you want to catch live jazz music, Frenchmen Street is the place to be. It’s a favorite of locals and retains an authentic vibe despite the secret long being out on this space. We saw a great band with a skilled trumpet player on the second floor of Blue Nile, but my favorite is Bamboulas. I was there on Friday night and the band was outstanding, with people stopping in the streets to dance outside and look in through the windows. The party can go all night long on Frenchmen Street and with $6 drink specials and generally no cover except for special events, this is a great place to come, unwind and have a musical evening. 5) Tour the Garden District\nHave you ever seen “American Horror Story: Coven?” The Buckner Mansion in The Garden District is also known as Miss Robichaux’s Academy for Exceptional Young Ladies. The Garden District is where you’ll find New Orleans nicest houses, making this an essential stop for architecture lovers. You can reach the district by streetcar, just take the St. Charles route. Note that you need cash to ride the streetcar and they don’t always stop for new riders. Note to AHS fans: Madame LaLaurie’s home and torture chamber is also a real place and a popular stop on haunted walking tours. 6) Eat authentic New Orleans food\nIf there’s one thing you should do in New Orleans, it’s eat. For the best jambalaya, I recommend Coops Place where you’ll get a dish that’s hearty, tasty and doesn’t break the bank.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:0bf9b98f-c0c9-40f2-a826-e001bb3e08df>"]},{"passage":"I’ve taken a look at some of the ‘frightseeing’ tours on Flight Centre’s website that are guaranteed to send a shiver up (or down) your spine. Here are my personal favourites:\n- New Orleans Ghost Tour\nThe Big Easy is often referred to as ‘the most haunted city in the USA’ and after a two-hour walk through the city you may be inclined to agree.

Arranging tours of the places and attractions that you want to see will help you to make the most of your experience in New Orleans. If you are traveling to New Orleans specifically for massive events like Mardi Gras or the Jazz and Heritage Festival, then you may already have your itinerary pretty well filled. If, however, you are traveling to the city in a non-peak time, you may want to begin looking into which tours are available. Many times you can even save money by booking certain tours along with your hotel accommodations. From New Orleans ghost tours to New Orleans walking tours there is something to peak just about everyone’s excitement in the Big Easy. Tours in New Orleans\nNew Orleans ghost tours are some of the most popular because of the enigmatic nature of the program—what will happen and will the tour actually see a ghost? The answer is that the New Orleans ghost tours are more theater than anything else, but do give tourists a glimpse inside the areas of the city which are claimed to be haunted and where ghost sightings are rumored to have taken place. Every evening from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., New Orleans ghost tours are moderated by master storytellers that take guests on walking tours of the French Quarter. You also have the option of taking one of the interesting cemetery tours that give you access to the European inspired and longstanding places of rest such as St. Louis Cemetery and more. New Orleans bike tours are another great way to check out the city and get to all of the attractions you are interested in seeing at your own speed. There are a variety of providers that offer a range of tours and services. One such provider offers New Orleans bike tours that last for three hours and take you around to some of the most significant historical sights, with the aim of giving riders some real insights into the composition of the city. Most of the New Orleans bike tours are meant to be fun as well as informative. You can choose from ones that take you to popular attractions like the cemeteries, French Market, Garden District, and more, or from journeys that cruise the most notable music venues, art galleries, and other such tailored experiences. Amongst New Orleans tours, those that take people deep into the swamp are also very popular. On the amazing New Orleans swamp tours you are whistled off into the bayou to witness not only authentic Cajun folk living in the swamp, but also a seemingly inexhaustible variety of wildlife. At a place like the Barataria Swamps and Wetlands, you will see a ton of alligators, and even have the chance of witnessing the majestic bald eagle. These are extremely popular New Orleans tours for photographers and lovers of nature who get unrivaled opportunities to snap shots of the gorgeous swamps. From New Orleans bike tours to the swamp to the cemeteries, there is something for everyone to see on their ideal tour in the Big Easy.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ef455bdc-415c-45c2-81f7-7b05e4f715e4>"]},{"passage":"Happy Mardi Gras! Laissez les bon temps rouler! I thought it’d be fun to explore the most haunted Fat Tuesday\/Carnival cities that I could find. Dare to join me? Let’s indulge…\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\nI think it’s safe to say that the first place that probably pops to most people’s minds if they live in the U.S. and hear “Mardi Gras” is New Orleans. As for haunted places? Yep. New Orleans is loaded with those too. In the French Quarter alone you can find a concentration of New Orleans’ most haunted places. I’m talking haunted hotels, haunted restaurants, even haunted cemeteries! Just a few of the many popular haunted hotels include the Andrew Jackson Hotel, Omni Royal Orleans Hotel, and\nBourbon Orleans Hotel. You’ll find everything from the ghosts of Confederate soldiers, a ghost maid who tucks guests in, and the ghosts of children who died in a fire. Ghosts aren’t the only haunting things you might encounter in this city either. Be on the lookout for vampires. As Stephen P. Unger once wrote in a guest post here, New Orleans’ vampire scene has been active for many, many decades. Centuries even. Ever since the city was first established. Anne Rice certainly had a lot to draw from for her beloved novels. And if you want to take a Mardi Gras, ghost, or vampire tour, Viator offers a bunch, such as:\n- Mardi Gras World: Behind-the-Scenes Tour in New Orleans\n- Mardi Gras Walking Tour in New Orleans\n- New Orleans Ghost Adventure\n- Murder in New Orleans Ghost Tour\n- New Orleans Haunted History Ghost Tour\n- New Orleans Ghosts and Spirits Walking Tour\n- French Quarter Haunted Excursion In New Orleans\n- New Orleans Supernatural Tour\n- New Orleans Voodoo Mystery and Paranormal Tour\n- French Quarter Walking Ghost Tour of New Orleans\n- Haunted History Of New Orleans\n- Ghostly Galavant New Orleans\n- New Orleans Vampire Tour\nRio de Janeiro, Brazil\nAnother huge Mardi Gras –or, rather, Carnival— hot spot is Brazil’s Rio. As for being haunted…well, that’s not among its claims to fame. There are a lot of haunting stories about the real life struggles of living there (especially in the favelas), but no real ghost accounts like what I’m looking for. However, it’s such an iconic Mardi Gras destination that to not include it would be blasphemous. So I searched hard and came up with one haunted place to share. Not far from Rio is the Imperial Museum in Petropolis. (It’s also known as the Petropolis Museum.) Allegedly the ghost of Emperor Dom Pedros II haunts its garden. (It used to be the Emperor’s favorite residence.) Viator even offers a tour there:\nAnother iconic Carnival hot spot is Venice. Mysterious, beguiling, and enchanting, this Italian City of Love is famous for its canals, culture and architecture. But it does possess a dark side. And seems to have its fair share of curses. (Which caught my eye, because of my recently released Shadow People and Cursed Objects: 13 Tales of Terror Based on True Stories…or are they? anthology.) Some feel sure that the Cà Dario, or Palazzo Dario, is cursed. After all, death has befallen all who have owned it. The Casin degli spiriti is a palace that is also regarded as a cursed location. It includes tales ranging from spirit and demon-invoking religious sects who practiced there to a heartbroken suicidal ghost who still roams there. Fishermen won’t fish in that lagoon because of a horrible murder in the 1950s where the killer chopped the victim’s body up before throwing the remains in those waters. And then there’s the very creepy Poveglia Island. Another place fisherman don’t dare go near for fear it’s cursed. It’s a 10 minute ferry ride from Venice and was home to Black Death victims during the plague epidemic. Centuries later it became a psychiatric hospital run by a doctor who tortured the patients. He went mad himself and committed suicide after claiming to be haunted by the island’s ghosts. 160,000 deaths are said to have occurred there.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:2f4a1bc1-0e11-415f-9266-7f7e7a83e9da>"]},{"passage":"Did you schedule a guided tour - 9\/11 Memorial and Museum at Ground Zero Free Tours\nWo95\/3919)34 Pieces of YouThe Mystery Fancier (Vol. 4 No. 6) A Guided Tour for BeginnersThe Night Sky Observers Guide - Page 3.

Not that Spanish cinema really needs me to champion it with the number of consistently excellent films that appear every year. Solas (meaning Alone) is in fact quite an old film - it was released in 1999 – but it was new to me when I watched it recently. It is an unsentimental and often very moving film about the difficult relationship between a mother and daughter, forced by the illness of their violent husband\/father to spend time under the same roof. Maria, 35, was estranged from her family when she left her home village for the city only to swap rural for urban poverty, and lives alone, bitter and (when the film starts) pregnant from a boyfriend who has long since done a runner. Her elderly mother Rosa, is initially an unwanted guest not least because she forces Maria to face up to her own problems but as the film goes on the two learn to appreciate each other. And ultimately there is some kind of redemption in what otherwise is a very bleak landscape. I probably couldn't describe watching Solas as a wholly enjoyable experience, but it is beautifully scripted and brilliantly acted - and, like all great films, it stays with you long after the credits have rolled.\n\nSpain Works (Examples)\nA Franco plan led to slower global financial advancement.

This series was designed to give this unknown branch of film the visibility it deserves. From more than a thousand films, forty-three were chosen to be screened at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in six sessions. In order to spark a dialogue between the different eras, this vastly diverse group of seminal films was shown out of chronological order, blazing a trail through the almost unknown history of Spanish cinema. The programme Documents\/Itineraries opened the series with Fuego en Castilla (1958-1960) by José Val del Omar (Granada, 1904-Madrid, 1982), one of the most important figures in Spanish film. The session concluded with works by Gabriel Blanco (Cadiz, 1936-1991), Benet Rossell (Lerida, 1937) and Antoni Miralda (Tarrasa, 1942), José Luis Guerín (Barcelona, 1960) and Virginia García del Pino (Barcelona, 1966). The cult classic Arrebato (1979), directed by Iván Zulueta (San Sebastian, 1943-2009), was included in the series to introduce the world to a masterpiece that is one of the most hypnotic films of all time, loaded with mysticism and open to numerous readings. Animated Experiments: rhythm, light and colour looks at different periods from the history of experimental animated film in Spain, from pure abstraction to narrative. …Ere erera baleibu izik aruaren…, a nonsense phrase, is the title of the first and only full-length animated feature in the history of Spanish cinema, a film entirely hand painted using animation techniques without a camera. Jose Antonio Sistiaga (San Sebastian, 1932) used 35 mm celluloid film as his canvas, applying paint directly to the film. Investigations\/Metafilm invites viewers to reflect on the essence of film in its different manifestations from cinematic essays to blank screen, passing through a dialogue with dance, performance art, photography and poetry. The programme Appropriations\/Great Super 8 sets up a conversation between the generation of filmmakers who tried to break into experimental film from the avant-garde in Barcelona, Madrid and Valencia during the 1970s and the new crop appearing at the dawn of the 21st century. In addition to this retrospective of Spanish experimental film, the programme offers a chance to meet the artist Toni Serra (Barcelona, 1960) - whose film Minnesota 1943 (1995) is included in the series - with a presentation of his recent works, which explore the idea of trance and the reality of dreams.

Written by\nLisa Dowling <email@example.com>\nI sat down to watch this last night, expecting to see the movie with Jennifer Love Hewitt (this one is called \"If Only\" on this side of the pond), and almost turned it off in the first 10 minutes. I'm glad I didn't. Douglas Henshaw looks so shambolic that its difficult to believe he pulled a poppet like Lena Headley, but he is a very good actor and gradually the movie draws you in, taking you on a whimsical ride in the style of Richard Curtis, albeit rather more subdued. My guess is that Penelope Cruz was there to provide American audiences with a familiar name, and she does an reasonable job without ever setting the screen alight. What I'd really like to know though is whether the characters of the Spanish garbagemen came about as a result of casting her, or vice-versa. Either way, it works well, and the resulting story of love, choices, fate and moving on is nicely told, without preaching. Unfortunately, I worked out what was going to happen about half an hour before the end, and for that reason can only give it 8\/10; but it was a good enough film to watch it out, and I'm sure it'll provide canoodling couples with a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours for many years to come. 2 of 3 people found this review helpful. Was this review helpful to you?\n\nI am the writer and director of this feature film. I have always had an interest in romantic crime thrillers. I am thrilled that we can present our film project on this site ... and the possibility that\nbackers around the world will be able to participate in making this dream ... a reality. \"Blood on the Streets\" is the story about a mysterious detective, a beautiful woman, and a criminal family in Madrid, Spain who launches a\nbloody war when someone crosses over to the other side and commits the ultimate sin of betrayal. It is an English\/Spanish language full-length\nfeature film that combines action, romance, and suspense. We have traveled to Spain to scout locations. We met with actors, talent agencies and production companies. Spain is known for having a very\nwell-established film infrastructure as well as their talented cast and crews. And, it is cheaper to shoot in Spain. Once we are funded, we will\ntravel to Spain and begin our preproduction and production schedule. We have a completed script ... Completed storyboards (shot for shot) ...\nLetter of interest from an award winning director of photography ... Letters of interest from bilingual Latin American and Spaniard Actors ... Please feel free to view the actors demos and resumes at ... Soaring cinematic score ...\nWe have spoken to several distributors. They have all expressed interest in the film project. They have asked us to contact them once we are\nfunded and we can show them a rough cut of the film. We plan on having a screening for them. We have contacted a few US talent agencies. They are also interested in being involved in the film project. If we our able to raise our projected\nbudget, then we can cast a couple of American stars. What is the synopsis of the film? Blood on the Streets is the story about a mysterious detective name Curtis Raven who falls in love with Sylvia Buñuel, a beautiful woman with\na secret past. Sylvia is searching for her missing brother David. She hires Curtis to find him, but they come up against a ruthless crime family. Franco Scala is the head of the family and will destroy anyone who comes across his path. Franco has escaped from prison and once again\nbegins his reign of threats and extortion. Franco makes the fatal mistake of getting involved in a love triangle that quickly becomes entangled\ninto a web of deceit and murder. He’s forced to hide in an abandoned warehouse with a hostage in tow. Five years ago, Franco had left Curtis\nfor dead in a dark alley. And now, Curtis has returned to exact his revenge in a fight to the death. But not everything looks as it appears and we\nare left with a surprising twist at the end. Yes. All of the actors from Latin America and Spain are fully bilingual. Have you thought about having an English and Spanish version? Yes. We are interested in shooting a film simultaneously in both English and Spanish and release both versions in domestic and international\nmarkets. Four or five takes in English. Then, four or five takes in Spanish. All of the actors are looking forward to this challenge. Have you thought about shooting the film in the US? Yes, but after making trips to various locations in Spain, meeting with the talented casts and crews, and that it is less expensive ... it makes\nsense both financially and logistically ... to shoot the entire film on location in Spain. Why are you interested in using the thriller genre in the film? Blood on the Streets will use the thriller genre to explore the romance, passion, the sorrow, and the triumph of a deeply human story that is\ncommon to us all. Blood on the Streets is intended to offer all of its audiences a portrait of a man who seeks revenge and the other his\nBlood on the Streets provides an opportunity to fully explore the story of two different men. One of them wants his revenge over being left for\ndead in a dark alley. The other man is a hardened criminal who will destroy anyone who gets in his way. There are several women who\nbecome involved with these men and ultimately some of them meet their final fate at the end. Our film provides a fresh and new prospective\non this story … yet the themes of the thriller are still familiar to a universal audience. What format will you be shooting in? We will be shooting in Sony HD. What will be the total running time of the film? The film should run about 90 to 95 minutes long. Do you have any other feature film projects that you intend to shoot in Latin America or Spain? Letter of interest from an award winning sound designer ...\n\nHow did you get interested in filmmaking? By going to the pictures. I was very impressed particularly by a film called Goliath and the Dragon, because there was a dinosaur in it, by Ray Harryhausen films, and by the original King Kong. If there was a dinosaur in it, I was there. In your Revengers Tragedy diary, you mention taking footage for use in future mini-DV movies. Can you tell me more about these movies? Are they hobbies, home movies or just for fun? That was probably footage for the additional DVD elements. The producers and I had a feeling while we were in production that the financiers or DVD distributors would want more than a half-hour \"making of.\" So we rustled up a small crew, and later, I concocted half a dozen small films around the making of Revengers. They're on the American and the Japanese DVDs, though strangely not the British one. Are there plans to release the film theatrically or on DVD in mainland Europe? The film has played theatrically in the UK and at festivals in Locarno, Cork, and Bruxelles. It was rejected by the Berlin Festival. I don't know what other European sales on DVD or film there might be. You have mentioned several times your admiration for Buñuel and Kurosawa. What are your personal favorite films by each of them? My favorite Buñuel films are El Ángel exterminador, El and L'Age D'Or. My favorite Kurosawas are Seven Samurai, Ikiru and Madadayo. Do you see any similarities in their work? I don't see any similarities at all! What other films or filmmakers do you admire or have influenced your work? I like very much the work of Francesco Rosi, especially The Mattei Affair, and the Russian film Idi y smotri (Come and See), Corbucci's Il Grande Silenzio (The Great Silence), and Leone's For a Few Dollars More. Of American directors, my favorites are Welles, Peckinpah, Huston, Hellman andAldrich. Everything I've seen has probably had some impact on my stuff, unless it was instantly forgotten. Any current films or filmmakers you admire? The only film I've seen recently that impressed me was Gus Van Sant's Elephant. Music has always played an important role in your films, from the classic soundtracks of Repo Man and Straight to Hell to Chumbawamba scoring your Revengers Tragedy. How do you go about choosing the music for your films? Does music ever come first? That is to say, are characters, scenes or dialog ever shaped by the music you want to use? Music was influential in advance in Sid & Nancy, where sequences are constructed around specific songs, and Walker, where Rudy wrote that Walker's men depart the burning cathedral singing \"Onward Christian Soldiers.\" The main theme for Straight to Hell was composed before the film was made, and it was nice to listen to it out there on a desert evening. But I don't think it made any difference to the film. Whereas some of the songs that arose spontaneously in Straight to Hell - \"Danny Boy,\" the \"Hardware Man's Love Song\" and the \"Weiner Song\" - were very significant. Do you play music yourself? No, I have no musical talents. But I like listening to it. What are some of your current favorites? My favorite bands are the Beatles and the Clash. So you know how old I am. I am also very keen on Chumbawamba, Space, Pete Wylie aka The Mighty Wah!, and when I'm in the mood for film soundtracks, Morricone and Pray For Rain. Yorkie of Space has a massive collection of solo material and I have been enjoying that of late. How did it come about that you lived in Mexico City? I lived in Mexico City because it was the capital of the Mexican film industry - the last two studios were there, as was the editing, camera and sound equipment. So even if you shot in Durango, or Zacatecas, the base was Mexico City. I love the Distrito Federal very much. It has a great Metro system, great steam baths, a superb museum of Mexican art - including landscapes by Jose Maria Velasco - the Museo Nacional. And I made many friends there. If I must be based in a city, Mexico is the city I would prefer. You have made films in several countries.\n\nThe histories of those relationships are not that well documented…\nLuchino Visconti's \"The Leopard\", 1963\nI was recently watching The Pink Panther, and I found out that Yves Saint Laurent did the costumes for the principal characters. Only for Claudia Cardinale. I think Givenchy did Capucine, and Saint Laurent did Claudia Cardinale... I was wondering if Balenciaga he had ever received movie offers? Because you’d think he would be ripe for partnering with Luis Bunuel, or …\nHe did the costumes for Arletty in a 40s movie called Boléro, and...a couple of his actress-clients wore his clothes in their movies rather than him actually costuming them. It just wasn’t something it seems to have interested him. It was something Dior and Balmain did, Jacques Fath did, Chanel did. I think he just wasn’t interested, really. So, what film do you go back to over & over for inspiration that you find interesting each time? Do you have more film projects yourself coming up? I know you were in Marie Antoinette, and Gossip Girl most recently…\nAnd Wall Street 2… I don’t have any plans, but it’s always fun to be asked. Do you ever think about writing or directing? That would be intriguing, yes. Both of those options would be intriguing, yes. And what about Oscars? Do you watch them, at home, or do you go? I certainly watched the Golden Globes, I was much engaged. I’ve never been no, but I enjoy watching them. What about the Royal Wedding coming up in April? Any thoughts on Kate Middleton? Are you a fan…? I think she’s played it all very well, indeed. She’s stayed inscrutable which is a great challenge this day and age. Do you think she’ll go with the Emmanuel’s? No. I can’t imagine she would want to associate herself that closely with her late future mother in law. You know, it will be interesting to see. I think she’s made very sensible choices so far. So it will be intriguing. I wait with breath baited. As we close, what do you recommend for any kind of a young designer, or even a writer, who writes about fashion & culture and things like that…What’s a good way to develop your visual sense, or your aesthetic sense? What’s a good way to gain exposure? I think it’s just sort of saturating yourself in what’s going on in contemporary culture and going to museums and art galleries, and going to the theatre if you can, and certainly going to the cinema. I think it’s just being open to all kinds of cultural influences and zeitgeist – that’s how the zeitgeist is created. So, just being sensitive to that. Balenciaga. Suit of mustard yellow linen; Summer, 1950. Collection of Hamish Bowles. Photograph by Joe McDonald\/FAMSF\nAnd what was your first exposure to Balenciaga? My first exposure, well, I was aware of him, and then the first piece I bought for my collection I was about 11 or 12 I think, was an early 60s Balenciaga suit at a charity sale. And, at the same sale there was a bolero – it was for a ballet company. A bolero had been donated by Margot Fonteyn, the great prima ballerina, and it was auctioned and sold for 60 pounds which was far more; it was 120 weeks worth of pocket money – so I couldn’t afford that. But, incredibly enough, about 5 or 6 years ago I went to a vintage store in Los Angeles and found the same – I found the jacket there, and it’s going to be in the exhibition. It’s a wonderful matador-inspired bolero and a detail of the embroidery is the dust-jacket for the catalog. So you’re going to see it in all its glory! Balenciaga and Spainopens at the de Young museum on March 26th. Fran Jeffries (left) sings \"Meglio Stasera\" in The Pink Panther from 1964. To honor the recent passing of Blake Edwards, TCM played a number of his most famous films earlier this week. Among them was The Pink Panther from 1964. Although this is always an entertaining film (the exploding bottle of champagne still makes me crack up! ), I had never really noticed how chic it is in all of its mid-1960s glamour.\n\nSo I was dealing with a lot of high level, expensive projects. A lot of times, working on those types of projects can be very frustrating if you really like film. I came into this industry because I have a passion for film. However, as a broker, dealing with financing projects can be very frustrating because a lot of people involved in that part of the process are not filmmakers. Oftentimes, people outside come to the film industry to test the waters or to make some money or whatever, but the key to being successful in these creative industries is really about talent. You have to work with the right talent in order to have good films and in order to make money. That’s the dilemma. At the beginning of last year, I decided that I should really start focusing on what I love to do and stop wasting time on other things, so that is how I made the decision to begin producing independent films. Are there certain criteria that you look for when making a decision to fund a particular project? I think for me, I really need to work with good human beings; I need to work with good people. Also, I like projects really driven by filmmakers and also working with first-time writers and directors. It’s exciting to work with upcoming, young talent for the future. Have you faced any hardships or difficulties trying to establish yourself so far? What challenges come from being young, female, and a minority in an industry still dominated by older, white men? Yeah, I feel like first of all, being a woman in this industry, isn’t easy to begin with. Also, I am Chinese, and I came to the United States five years ago for graduate school. It’s hard, you know, but I think I was lucky because I got to go to a good producing program at Carnegie Mellon University. I felt really nurtured by the professors there and had so many amazing mentors. Paula Wagner, one of my professors and mentors, is a very inspiring woman. She produced the Mission Impossible franchise, and she was the former agent of Tom Cruise. Also, another producer, Janet Yang, she’s the most successful and experienced American-Chinese film maker in this industry; I learned a lot from her. Being able to work and learn from these incredible women and other people is really exciting to me. Being an outsider and a minority in this society does create blocks and anxieties, in some ways. But I just focus on the things I feel passionate about and do what I can. In this current moment, I feel so empowered by the solidarity of women within the entertainment industry. I feel so great about it, and I hope this spread to different places in the world, including China. I really hope it’ll travel all over. What advice do you have for filmmakers who are looking to fund a project? How can they get the attention of producers looking to invest? That’s a really great question; I love that! First-time filmmakers or filmmakers who are still making shorts can have a really hard time getting funding. It is important to not give up on the story you feel most passionate about and the message you want to deliver and communicate with the audience. Just hold on to it. Sometimes it’s hard for filmmakers to find the right producers who understand their vision, but don’t give up because there are producers out there who are looking for new, exciting talent. I would say these upcoming filmmakers should definitely submit their work to Sundance Labs. I would say the same for Tribeca; they also have a really good shorts program. Oh and South by Southwest! In Asia, there’s the Shanghai Film Festival, and they also have labs for upcoming filmmakers. Just don’t give up on your work. Get your short film to different festivals. There are always producers there looking for these first-time filmmakers, and they will find you. Also, if you’re working on your first script for your first feature, just be patient. Give it time and get a lot of notes from mentors and experienced people, and don’t rush it. It took five years for Nancy to find its producers and financing. That’s a long time, so you just have to learn to give it time and patience. Do you have any projects in the works right now? Oh yeah of course! I’m working with a first time Chinese writer\/director for his feature debut film; it’s called Yoyo. We’re aiming to shoot in August in China. It’s a dramatic thriller set in China during the mid-‘90’s.","passages":[{"passage":"A roll of 16mm. Eachone a story.

Not that Spanish cinema really needs me to champion it with the number of consistently excellent films that appear every year. Solas (meaning Alone) is in fact quite an old film - it was released in 1999 – but it was new to me when I watched it recently. It is an unsentimental and often very moving film about the difficult relationship between a mother and daughter, forced by the illness of their violent husband\/father to spend time under the same roof. Maria, 35, was estranged from her family when she left her home village for the city only to swap rural for urban poverty, and lives alone, bitter and (when the film starts) pregnant from a boyfriend who has long since done a runner. Her elderly mother Rosa, is initially an unwanted guest not least because she forces Maria to face up to her own problems but as the film goes on the two learn to appreciate each other. And ultimately there is some kind of redemption in what otherwise is a very bleak landscape. I probably couldn't describe watching Solas as a wholly enjoyable experience, but it is beautifully scripted and brilliantly acted - and, like all great films, it stays with you long after the credits have rolled.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:dd69f2a9-26d8-4ad2-adde-ec2503b52170>"]},{"passage":"Spain Works (Examples)\nA Franco plan led to slower global financial advancement.

This series was designed to give this unknown branch of film the visibility it deserves. From more than a thousand films, forty-three were chosen to be screened at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in six sessions. In order to spark a dialogue between the different eras, this vastly diverse group of seminal films was shown out of chronological order, blazing a trail through the almost unknown history of Spanish cinema. The programme Documents\/Itineraries opened the series with Fuego en Castilla (1958-1960) by José Val del Omar (Granada, 1904-Madrid, 1982), one of the most important figures in Spanish film. The session concluded with works by Gabriel Blanco (Cadiz, 1936-1991), Benet Rossell (Lerida, 1937) and Antoni Miralda (Tarrasa, 1942), José Luis Guerín (Barcelona, 1960) and Virginia García del Pino (Barcelona, 1966). The cult classic Arrebato (1979), directed by Iván Zulueta (San Sebastian, 1943-2009), was included in the series to introduce the world to a masterpiece that is one of the most hypnotic films of all time, loaded with mysticism and open to numerous readings. Animated Experiments: rhythm, light and colour looks at different periods from the history of experimental animated film in Spain, from pure abstraction to narrative. …Ere erera baleibu izik aruaren…, a nonsense phrase, is the title of the first and only full-length animated feature in the history of Spanish cinema, a film entirely hand painted using animation techniques without a camera. Jose Antonio Sistiaga (San Sebastian, 1932) used 35 mm celluloid film as his canvas, applying paint directly to the film. Investigations\/Metafilm invites viewers to reflect on the essence of film in its different manifestations from cinematic essays to blank screen, passing through a dialogue with dance, performance art, photography and poetry. The programme Appropriations\/Great Super 8 sets up a conversation between the generation of filmmakers who tried to break into experimental film from the avant-garde in Barcelona, Madrid and Valencia during the 1970s and the new crop appearing at the dawn of the 21st century. In addition to this retrospective of Spanish experimental film, the programme offers a chance to meet the artist Toni Serra (Barcelona, 1960) - whose film Minnesota 1943 (1995) is included in the series - with a presentation of his recent works, which explore the idea of trance and the reality of dreams.

I'm glad I didn't. Douglas Henshaw looks so shambolic that its difficult to believe he pulled a poppet like Lena Headley, but he is a very good actor and gradually the movie draws you in, taking you on a whimsical ride in the style of Richard Curtis, albeit rather more subdued. My guess is that Penelope Cruz was there to provide American audiences with a familiar name, and she does an reasonable job without ever setting the screen alight. What I'd really like to know though is whether the characters of the Spanish garbagemen came about as a result of casting her, or vice-versa. Either way, it works well, and the resulting story of love, choices, fate and moving on is nicely told, without preaching. Unfortunately, I worked out what was going to happen about half an hour before the end, and for that reason can only give it 8\/10; but it was a good enough film to watch it out, and I'm sure it'll provide canoodling couples with a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours for many years to come. 2 of 3 people found this review helpful.

I have always had an interest in romantic crime thrillers. I am thrilled that we can present our film project on this site ... and the possibility that\nbackers around the world will be able to participate in making this dream ... a reality. \"Blood on the Streets\" is the story about a mysterious detective, a beautiful woman, and a criminal family in Madrid, Spain who launches a\nbloody war when someone crosses over to the other side and commits the ultimate sin of betrayal. It is an English\/Spanish language full-length\nfeature film that combines action, romance, and suspense. We have traveled to Spain to scout locations. We met with actors, talent agencies and production companies. Spain is known for having a very\nwell-established film infrastructure as well as their talented cast and crews. And, it is cheaper to shoot in Spain. Once we are funded, we will\ntravel to Spain and begin our preproduction and production schedule. We have a completed script ...

They have asked us to contact them once we are\nfunded and we can show them a rough cut of the film. We plan on having a screening for them. We have contacted a few US talent agencies. They are also interested in being involved in the film project. If we our able to raise our projected\nbudget, then we can cast a couple of American stars. What is the synopsis of the film? Blood on the Streets is the story about a mysterious detective name Curtis Raven who falls in love with Sylvia Buñuel, a beautiful woman with\na secret past. Sylvia is searching for her missing brother David. She hires Curtis to find him, but they come up against a ruthless crime family. Franco Scala is the head of the family and will destroy anyone who comes across his path. Franco has escaped from prison and once again\nbegins his reign of threats and extortion. Franco makes the fatal mistake of getting involved in a love triangle that quickly becomes entangled\ninto a web of deceit and murder. He’s forced to hide in an abandoned warehouse with a hostage in tow. Five years ago, Franco had left Curtis\nfor dead in a dark alley. And now, Curtis has returned to exact his revenge in a fight to the death. But not everything looks as it appears and we\nare left with a surprising twist at the end. Yes. All of the actors from Latin America and Spain are fully bilingual. Have you thought about having an English and Spanish version? Yes. We are interested in shooting a film simultaneously in both English and Spanish and release both versions in domestic and international\nmarkets. Four or five takes in English. Then, four or five takes in Spanish. All of the actors are looking forward to this challenge. Have you thought about shooting the film in the US? Yes, but after making trips to various locations in Spain, meeting with the talented casts and crews, and that it is less expensive ... it makes\nsense both financially and logistically ... to shoot the entire film on location in Spain. Why are you interested in using the thriller genre in the film? Blood on the Streets will use the thriller genre to explore the romance, passion, the sorrow, and the triumph of a deeply human story that is\ncommon to us all. Blood on the Streets is intended to offer all of its audiences a portrait of a man who seeks revenge and the other his\nBlood on the Streets provides an opportunity to fully explore the story of two different men. One of them wants his revenge over being left for\ndead in a dark alley. The other man is a hardened criminal who will destroy anyone who gets in his way.

By going to the pictures. I was very impressed particularly by a film called Goliath and the Dragon, because there was a dinosaur in it, by Ray Harryhausen films, and by the original King Kong. If there was a dinosaur in it, I was there. In your Revengers Tragedy diary, you mention taking footage for use in future mini-DV movies. Can you tell me more about these movies? Are they hobbies, home movies or just for fun? That was probably footage for the additional DVD elements. The producers and I had a feeling while we were in production that the financiers or DVD distributors would want more than a half-hour \"making of.\" So we rustled up a small crew, and later, I concocted half a dozen small films around the making of Revengers. They're on the American and the Japanese DVDs, though strangely not the British one. Are there plans to release the film theatrically or on DVD in mainland Europe? The film has played theatrically in the UK and at festivals in Locarno, Cork, and Bruxelles. It was rejected by the Berlin Festival. I don't know what other European sales on DVD or film there might be. You have mentioned several times your admiration for Buñuel and Kurosawa. What are your personal favorite films by each of them? My favorite Buñuel films are El Ángel exterminador, El and L'Age D'Or. My favorite Kurosawas are Seven Samurai, Ikiru and Madadayo. Do you see any similarities in their work? I don't see any similarities at all! What other films or filmmakers do you admire or have influenced your work? I like very much the work of Francesco Rosi, especially The Mattei Affair, and the Russian film Idi y smotri (Come and See), Corbucci's Il Grande Silenzio (The Great Silence), and Leone's For a Few Dollars More. Of American directors, my favorites are Welles, Peckinpah, Huston, Hellman andAldrich. Everything I've seen has probably had some impact on my stuff, unless it was instantly forgotten. Any current films or filmmakers you admire? The only film I've seen recently that impressed me was Gus Van Sant's Elephant. Music has always played an important role in your films, from the classic soundtracks of Repo Man and Straight to Hell to Chumbawamba scoring your Revengers Tragedy. How do you go about choosing the music for your films? Does music ever come first? That is to say, are characters, scenes or dialog ever shaped by the music you want to use? Music was influential in advance in Sid & Nancy, where sequences are constructed around specific songs, and Walker, where Rudy wrote that Walker's men depart the burning cathedral singing \"Onward Christian Soldiers.\" The main theme for Straight to Hell was composed before the film was made, and it was nice to listen to it out there on a desert evening. But I don't think it made any difference to the film. Whereas some of the songs that arose spontaneously in Straight to Hell - \"Danny Boy,\" the \"Hardware Man's Love Song\" and the \"Weiner Song\" - were very significant. Do you play music yourself? No, I have no musical talents. But I like listening to it. What are some of your current favorites? My favorite bands are the Beatles and the Clash. So you know how old I am. I am also very keen on Chumbawamba, Space, Pete Wylie aka The Mighty Wah!, and when I'm in the mood for film soundtracks, Morricone and Pray For Rain. Yorkie of Space has a massive collection of solo material and I have been enjoying that of late. How did it come about that you lived in Mexico City? I lived in Mexico City because it was the capital of the Mexican film industry - the last two studios were there, as was the editing, camera and sound equipment. So even if you shot in Durango, or Zacatecas, the base was Mexico City. I love the Distrito Federal very much. It has a great Metro system, great steam baths, a superb museum of Mexican art - including landscapes by Jose Maria Velasco - the Museo Nacional. And I made many friends there. If I must be based in a city, Mexico is the city I would prefer. You have made films in several countries.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:387bb762-3aba-4518-a585-f4834a1b5a14>"]},{"passage":"The histories of those relationships are not that well documented…\nLuchino Visconti's \"The Leopard\", 1963\nI was recently watching The Pink Panther, and I found out that Yves Saint Laurent did the costumes for the principal characters. Only for Claudia Cardinale. I think Givenchy did Capucine, and Saint Laurent did Claudia Cardinale... I was wondering if Balenciaga he had ever received movie offers? Because you’d think he would be ripe for partnering with Luis Bunuel, or …\nHe did the costumes for Arletty in a 40s movie called Boléro, and...a couple of his actress-clients wore his clothes in their movies rather than him actually costuming them. It just wasn’t something it seems to have interested him. It was something Dior and Balmain did, Jacques Fath did, Chanel did. I think he just wasn’t interested, really. So, what film do you go back to over & over for inspiration that you find interesting each time? Do you have more film projects yourself coming up? I know you were in Marie Antoinette, and Gossip Girl most recently…\nAnd Wall Street 2… I don’t have any plans, but it’s always fun to be asked. Do you ever think about writing or directing? That would be intriguing, yes. Both of those options would be intriguing, yes. And what about Oscars? Do you watch them, at home, or do you go? I certainly watched the Golden Globes, I was much engaged. I’ve never been no, but I enjoy watching them. What about the Royal Wedding coming up in April? Any thoughts on Kate Middleton? Are you a fan…? I think she’s played it all very well, indeed. She’s stayed inscrutable which is a great challenge this day and age. Do you think she’ll go with the Emmanuel’s? No. I can’t imagine she would want to associate herself that closely with her late future mother in law. You know, it will be interesting to see. I think she’s made very sensible choices so far. So it will be intriguing. I wait with breath baited. As we close, what do you recommend for any kind of a young designer, or even a writer, who writes about fashion & culture and things like that…What’s a good way to develop your visual sense, or your aesthetic sense? What’s a good way to gain exposure? I think it’s just sort of saturating yourself in what’s going on in contemporary culture and going to museums and art galleries, and going to the theatre if you can, and certainly going to the cinema. I think it’s just being open to all kinds of cultural influences and zeitgeist – that’s how the zeitgeist is created. So, just being sensitive to that. Balenciaga. Suit of mustard yellow linen; Summer, 1950. Collection of Hamish Bowles. Photograph by Joe McDonald\/FAMSF\nAnd what was your first exposure to Balenciaga? My first exposure, well, I was aware of him, and then the first piece I bought for my collection I was about 11 or 12 I think, was an early 60s Balenciaga suit at a charity sale. And, at the same sale there was a bolero – it was for a ballet company. A bolero had been donated by Margot Fonteyn, the great prima ballerina, and it was auctioned and sold for 60 pounds which was far more; it was 120 weeks worth of pocket money – so I couldn’t afford that. But, incredibly enough, about 5 or 6 years ago I went to a vintage store in Los Angeles and found the same – I found the jacket there, and it’s going to be in the exhibition. It’s a wonderful matador-inspired bolero and a detail of the embroidery is the dust-jacket for the catalog. So you’re going to see it in all its glory!

A lot of times, working on those types of projects can be very frustrating if you really like film. I came into this industry because I have a passion for film. However, as a broker, dealing with financing projects can be very frustrating because a lot of people involved in that part of the process are not filmmakers. Oftentimes, people outside come to the film industry to test the waters or to make some money or whatever, but the key to being successful in these creative industries is really about talent. You have to work with the right talent in order to have good films and in order to make money. That’s the dilemma. At the beginning of last year, I decided that I should really start focusing on what I love to do and stop wasting time on other things, so that is how I made the decision to begin producing independent films. Are there certain criteria that you look for when making a decision to fund a particular project? I think for me, I really need to work with good human beings; I need to work with good people. Also, I like projects really driven by filmmakers and also working with first-time writers and directors. It’s exciting to work with upcoming, young talent for the future. Have you faced any hardships or difficulties trying to establish yourself so far? What challenges come from being young, female, and a minority in an industry still dominated by older, white men? Yeah, I feel like first of all, being a woman in this industry, isn’t easy to begin with. Also, I am Chinese, and I came to the United States five years ago for graduate school. It’s hard, you know, but I think I was lucky because I got to go to a good producing program at Carnegie Mellon University. I felt really nurtured by the professors there and had so many amazing mentors. Paula Wagner, one of my professors and mentors, is a very inspiring woman. She produced the Mission Impossible franchise, and she was the former agent of Tom Cruise. Also, another producer, Janet Yang, she’s the most successful and experienced American-Chinese film maker in this industry; I learned a lot from her. Being able to work and learn from these incredible women and other people is really exciting to me. Being an outsider and a minority in this society does create blocks and anxieties, in some ways. But I just focus on the things I feel passionate about and do what I can. In this current moment, I feel so empowered by the solidarity of women within the entertainment industry. I feel so great about it, and I hope this spread to different places in the world, including China. I really hope it’ll travel all over. What advice do you have for filmmakers who are looking to fund a project? How can they get the attention of producers looking to invest? That’s a really great question; I love that! First-time filmmakers or filmmakers who are still making shorts can have a really hard time getting funding. It is important to not give up on the story you feel most passionate about and the message you want to deliver and communicate with the audience. Just hold on to it. Sometimes it’s hard for filmmakers to find the right producers who understand their vision, but don’t give up because there are producers out there who are looking for new, exciting talent. I would say these upcoming filmmakers should definitely submit their work to Sundance Labs. I would say the same for Tribeca; they also have a really good shorts program. Oh and South by Southwest! In Asia, there’s the Shanghai Film Festival, and they also have labs for upcoming filmmakers. Just don’t give up on your work. Get your short film to different festivals. There are always producers there looking for these first-time filmmakers, and they will find you. Also, if you’re working on your first script for your first feature, just be patient. Give it time and get a lot of notes from mentors and experienced people, and don’t rush it. It took five years for Nancy to find its producers and financing. That’s a long time, so you just have to learn to give it time and patience. Do you have any projects in the works right now? Oh yeah of course! I’m working with a first time Chinese writer\/director for his feature debut film; it’s called Yoyo. We’re aiming to shoot in August in China. It’s a dramatic thriller set in China during the mid-‘90’s.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:8d803c17-0b39-49a3-95f3-34ea92651711>"]}]}

Arduino boards are open-source electronics platform that can be used to easily interface with hardware and sensors to expand the possibilities of your project. Arduino started in Italy in 2005. It has expanded over the years, with multiple manufacturers and distributors around the world. Arduino also has the Arduino IDE, the software that you use to program the board. The Arduino is a great educational tool to learn the basics of coding and electronics. There are lots of boards, starter kits, and shields to ensure that whatever your project is, you can find the parts for it. Arduino is simple enough that beginners can dive in easily, yet has enough options that advanced users can use it as well. The Arduino software can be used with any Windows, Linux or Mac computer. See the Official Arduino Introduction for a more in depth overview of the board. You can also see the Arduino Foundations page to get an idea of what’s involved in Arduino programming. Step 2: Which board do I use? Through the years, there have been many revisions of the Arduino board. We will go over a few key differences between the boards. You can see a full overview of all the Arduino products here: www.arduino.cc\/en\/Main\/Products\nThese boards are good for getting started with, and good for basic programming. Arduino Uno – Get it now! This is the basic beginners board. It has 14 digital input\/outputs (6 of which can be PWM pins), 6 analog inputs, and a 16MHz clock. This allows it to interface with a variety of sensors and applications. The Uno operates at 5V, and can be powered via the USB port, or it can take an input voltage of 6-20V (7-12 recommended) on the Vin pin. The 5V pin can supply 1A max for powering external sensors and outputs, if more then that is required you need an external power supply. If you try to draw more then 1A, the board will be damaged. The Arduino Uno measures 2.7″ by 2.1″. Arduino Micro – Get it now! The Arduino Micro is a small control board for when space is at a premium in your project. It measures 0.7″ by 1.9″. The Arduino Micro has many of the same specifications as the Uno, with a few differences. The Micro has 20 digital input\/output pins. 7 can be used as PWM pins, 12 as analog inputs. The serial communication with the computer is done differently, see the Arduino Leonardo board for more details. Arduino Pro\/Pro Micro\nThe Arduino Pro is a board with a few different versions. The Pro is a full sized board, compatible with the various shields. The Pro Mini measures 0.7″ by 1.3″, which makes it perfect for small projects. Each board comes in a 5V and 3.3V version. There are no headers attached to the board, which makes it slightly harder to use for prototyping, but gives it more flexibility when you are soldering the board into your project. The Arduino Pro has many of the same specifications as the Uno, with a few differences.The 3.3V version runs on a 8MHz clock, the 5V has a 16MHz clock. For power input, you need 3.3-12V for the 3.3V board, and 5-12V for the 5V board. The Arduino Nano is used for when you want the size of an Arduino Micro, but the functionality of an Uno. It has 14 digital input\/output pins (6 can be PWM), 8 analog inputs, and a 16MHz clock. It runs on 5V, taking an input power voltage of 7-12V. It measures 0.73″ x 1.7″. More Advanced Boards:\nThese boards have more advanced features for your next level projects. Arduino Mega – Get it now! The Arduino Mega is used for projects with tons of inputs and outputs. All the specs are the same as the Arduino Uno, but it has 54 digital inputs\/outputs (14 can be PWM), 16 analog inputs, and 4 UARTs for serial communication. It measures 2.1″ by 4″. Arduino Leonardo – Get it now! The Arduino Leonardo has the same specifications as the Arduino Micro. The big difference between the Leonardo\/Micro and all the other boards, is that there is no external chip for USB programming. Everything is built in to one controller. This allows these boards to be connected through a “Virtual COM port”, and allows the Leonardo\/Micro to communicate as a keyboard\/mouse to the computer. This also means that unlike the other boards, there is no reset when the serial port is opened.\n\n- Published in issue 5\/2019 on page 36\nMicrocontroller Kits for intermediate Users\nFor more challenging projects\nIf you've been dealing with the Arduino Uno or other 8-bit controller boards, but now need more processing power for more demanding projects, 32-bitters and professional development environments are the way forward. Taking the plunge is not as daunting as you imagined, as Elektor authors Viacheslav Gromov and Tam Hanna show in this article.\n\nChoosing an Arduino for Your Project\nThe next step in the Arduino evolutionary chain was merging the USB-to-Serial programming part of the board onto the main MCU. That meant we had to leave the ATmega328 behind -- because it doesn't natively support USB -- in favor of the ATmega32U4. Aside from the additional USB support, the 32U4 is largely similar to the 328. Both are 8-bit AVRs with 32kB of flash memory, 22-ish I\/O lines, ADCs, UARTs, timers, etc. These ATmega32U4 boards often have the benefit of being cheaper than the ATmega328-based boards -- there's one less costly IC to put on there. They can also do things regular Arduino boards can't, like emulate a USB keyboard\/mouse. On the downside, they can be less reliable, and more difficult to use. The Leonardo is the patriarch of all ATmega32U4 Arduino boards. It shares the same form factor and I\/O placement (analog, PWM, I2C pins in the same place) as the Arduino Uno, so it remains shield compatible. Arduino Leonardo with HeadersDEV-11286\nDifferences between the Leonardo and the Uno? Aside from the new microcontroller, and lack of a second USB-to-Serial-converting IC, there's not many. The USB connector is different, the Leonardo connects to a computer via a micro-B USB cable. The driver installation process is also a bit more involved -- sometimes it can take a little extra fidgeting to get the board installed on your computer. Just as the Pro Mini took the guts of the Arduino Uno and shrunk them down, the Pro Micro works as a miniature version of the Leonardo. Unlike the Pro Mini, the Pro Micro doesn't require an external board to upload a sketch -- the 32U4 takes care of everything! Pro Micros are among the more complicated Arduino boards to get up and running. There are extra steps required to enable them in your Arduino environment, and a misstep can (at least temporarily) \"brick\" the Pro Micro. These boards are a good choice if you're an advanced Arduino-er and have a small USB-oriented project in mind (a mini USB keyboard\/mouse?). There are plenty of other riffs on the Leonardo design as well. There's the Fio v3, for any Arduino Leonardo project you might want to add an XBee to. Or the Qduino Mini which adds a LiPo charger and battery fuel gauge, and two RGB LEDs (one for status and another that is user programmable!). The board was designed by Quin at the age of 14 and manufactured at SparkFun. Bare Conductive Touch Board\nThen there is the Bare Conductive touch board. Basically it is a Arduino Leonardo designed to turn almost any material or surface into a sensor. The board comes with a built-in capacitive touch sensor, a MP3 decoder IC, microSD card socket, and LiPo charge IC to create light switches, musical instruments, custom interactive surfaces.\n\nFor debugging your programs, you need to do workarounds to see the Serial.prints() in your setup() routine. Arduino Due – Get it now! The Arduino Due is the biggest and baddest of the boards. The most crucial difference between this board and the others is that it runs at 3.3V, not 5V. This means that you may need external circuitry to interface this with regular 5V sensors. You can still input 7-12V, but the input\/output pins require 3.3V. The Arduino Due is the size of a Mega, 2.1″ by 4″. It has 54 digital inputs\/outputs (12 can be PWM), 12 analog inputs, and 4 UARTs for serial communication. It runs on a 32 bit processor, running at 84MHz. This allows it to do bigger calculations (4 bytes at a time, rather then 2), over 5 times faster then the other Arduino boards. This makes the programs run up to 10x faster. The Due also has an unlimited number of interrupt pins, due to the second processor, allowing it to get even more feedback from the world around it. Arduino Ethernet – Get it now! The Arduino Ethernet board is like a Arduino Uno with an Ethernet shield built into it. There is also a micro SD card reader built in. It has the same number of inputs\/outputs as the Uno, but 4 are used for communication with the Ethernet system, and 4 are used for the SD reader. This leaves 6 available digital input\/outputs (4 can be PWM), and 6 analog inputs. By using the ethernet port, you can connect this board to the internet to open a whole new world of possibilities for your projects. The Arduino Yun is a very special board. First, is a combination of two processors. One processor runs the Arduino programs, and the other processor runs a Linux distribution that allows you to write shell and python scripts. Second, it has built in WiFi and Ethernet capabilities, to make it easy to connect your projects to the internet. Finally, it has a built in SD card reader to expand the storage space of your programs. The Yun has 20 digital input\/output pins (7 can be PWM), 12 analog inputs, and a 16MHz clock. It measures 2.09″ by 2.87″. Now that we’ve gone over all the Arduino boards, it’s time to move on to setting up the software! Step 3: Software Setup\nOnce you’ve picked your board, you need to install all the software and drivers so that you can start programming! Arduino has written the best getting started guide, see here for the various instructions for each board. Once all the drivers and the Arduino IDE is installed, you can begin programming. Before you can upload code, ensure that the correct board and port is selected. On the top menus, go to “Tools” – “Board”, and choose which board you are using. Then, go to “Tools” – “Port” and choose the port that corresponds to your Arduino. The getting started guide that is linked above has more information and troubleshooting options if you are having issues getting everything working. Step 4: Basic Examples\nThe easiest example to test your board is the “Blink” example. Most boards have a built in LED, so you can use the “Blink” example to make sure that you can upload code to the board. Find the example by opening the Arduino IDE, then going to “File” – “Examples” – “Basics” – “Blink”. You can change the Pin from 13 to whatever pin the LED is on on your board. The delay(1000) will pause the program for the specified amount of time. It is called in milliseconds, so 1000 means the program will pause for 1 second. Step 5: Conclusion\nWe learned how to get started using an Arduino in your project. Arduinos are a powerful, cost effective microcontroller that can be used in a variety of projects.\n\nThe long awaited ARM board by Arduino is finally here, now you can access higher level functionality while still using the wildly popular Arduino IDE. Warning: Unlike other Arduino boards, the Arduino Due board runs at 3.3V. The maximum voltage that the I\/O pins can tolerate is 3.3V. Providing higher voltages, like 5V to an I\/O pin could damage the board. If you are looking to interface 5V based product to the due we recommend using the Adafruit 8 channel bi-directional level converter. The Arduino Due is a microcontroller board based on the Atmel SAM3X8E ARM Cortex-M3 CPU (datasheet). It is the first Arduino board based on a 32-bit ARM core microcontroller. It has 54 digital input\/output pins (of which 12 can be used as PWM outputs), 12 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 84 MHz clock, an USB OTG capable connection, 2 DAC (digital to analog), 2 TWI, CAN bus, a power jack, an SPI header, a JTAG header, a reset button and an erase button. If you're curious to what the erase button does well it.....hmmm....how can we put this?....it swiftly eliminates the sketch you've uploaded to it....and in other terms: it erases your sketch. The board contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a micro-USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. The Due is compatible with Arduino shields that work at 3.3V and are compliant with the 1.0 Arduino pinout. Some interesting applications for the Due:\nFeatures and Specs:\n|Input Voltage (recommended)||7-12V|\n|Input Voltage (limits)||6-20V|\n|Digital I\/O Pins||54 (of which 12 provide PWM output)|\n|Analog Input Pins||12|\n|Analog Outputs Pins||2 (DAC)|\n|Total DC Output Current on all I\/O lines||130 mA|\n|DC Current for 3.3V Pin||800 mA|\n|DC Current for 5V Pin||800 mA|\n|Flash Memory||512 KB all available for user applications|\n|SRAM||96 KB (two banks: 64KB and 32KB)|\n|Clock Speed||84 MHz|\nThe Due follows the 1.0 pinout:\nThe Due has a dedicated forum for discussing the board. Here is the specification page for more info. Note: You will have download the newer Arduino 1.5 and above in order to have the Due board available in the IDE. If you do any work with the ATtiny cores you will have to temporarily remove the \"hardware\" folder from your main Arduino Sketch folder or the Arduino 1.5.1 IDE will crash on boot. Since we work with the SB-FireFly all the time, this happened to us.\n\nArduino Due is here! Arduino announces the release of the new Arduino Due board based on the Cortex M3 ARM processor\nThe release of the 1.0 Arduino platform in 2011 represented a milestone for Open Source Hardware: after six years of development, Arduino is declared mature and stable. Once this was achieved, the team applied itself to the new version of Arduino designed to provide more creative options to users. The result of this work is the Arduino Due, a board that provides increased performance and faster connectivity at an affordable price (49 USD MSRP). Arduino Due is ideal for those who want to build projects that require high computing power such as the remotely-controlled drones that, in order to fly, need to process a lot of sensor data per second. Arduino Due gives students the opportunity to learn the inner workings of the ARM processor in a cheaper and much simpler way than before. To Scientific projects, which need to acquire data quickly and accurately, Arduino Due provides a platform to create open source tools that are much more advanced than those available now. The new platform enables the open source digital fabrication community (3d Printers, Laser cutters, CNC milling machines) to achieve higher resolutions and faster speed with fewer components than in the past. Main features of Arduino Due\n• The board is equipped with a SAM3X8E processor from Atmel, based on the 32 bit ARM Cortex M3 architecture running at 84MHz. • USB 2.0 interface running at 480 Megabits that allows Arduino Due to act as a USB Host (so you can interface it to USB devices like mice, keyboards, cameras, mobile phones and more). Arduino Due supports the Android ADK 2012 protocol. • 12 analog inputs (ADC) with 12-bit resolution and high speed, opening the door to audio applications and signal processing projects that were impossible with Arduino Uno. • High-resolution Analog outputs (DAC). The board provides two 12-bit outputs that can be used to generate audio signals. The Arduino Due software comes with software examples for a WAV and OGG player. • 4 high-speed serial communication ports. • 70 input\/output pins. • High-speed CAN interface. The CAN protocol is used in the automotive industry to network the different components of the car, is now becoming popular in the field of industrial automation thanks to its speed and ability to withstand electrical noise. • 12 PWM channels. • 2 I2C bus. Operating Voltage 3.3V\nInput Voltage (recommended) 7-12V\nInput Voltage (min\/max) 6-20V\nDigital I\/O Pins 54 (of which 6 provide PWM)\nAnalog Input Pins 12\nAnalog Output Pins 2 (DAC)\nTotal DC Output Current on all I\/O lines 130 mA\nDC Current for 3.3V Pin 800 mA\nDC Current for 5V Pin theoretical 1A, recommended 800 mA\nFlash Memory 512 KB\nSRAM 96 KB (64 + 32 KB)\nClock speed 84 MHz\nDebug access JTAG\/SWD connector\n\nArduino boards are available from a number of outlets including group of Premier-Farnell Companies, namely, Farnell, Newark, Premier-Electronics for the MultiComp versions. Premier-Farnell took a conscious decision to offer their own version of the boards, proving that exact form-fit-function alternatives are possible to make and distribute, hence the Arduino-compatible boards from 'MultiComp' , including the Duemilanove (MC-Nove), Mega (MC-Mega) and Nano (MC-Nano). The popularity of the 3 boards mentioned above is easy to understand when one sees the number of projects being based upon them\nFor the sake of a couple of quid, I'd rather get the real thing and have my money go to the people who got it all started.

In case you are having an impressive and creative idea regarding\nelectronic project then you can avail its services without any kind of issue. Reasons for choosing\nMany individuals want to figure out reasons for choosing arduino and getting answer to raspberry pi vs arduino comparison. Following are some reasons –\n- It can be easily programmed with C++ language. - It is capable of working with the highest\ncommunication speeds with a computer. - In case of damages, the interested ones are\ncapable of replacing it with ease. - If you are buying it then you get ATmega328\nmicrocontroller equipped in it. This particular controller is associated with\nhigh memory feature. - Installation of Arduino is much easier as\ncompared to some other microcontrollers. On the basis of these factors, the interested ones can\neasily understand its importance and beneficial uses. It depends on the\nindividuals that what kind of activities they want to perform.\n\nIf you do audio, I like OPA2134s -- but not as comparators, get something cheap for that.- Both positive and negative linear regulators -- 7805, 7905, 7809, 7909, 7812, 7912, and the adjustable ones like LM317 and LM337. Might also be helpful to get some low drop-out 3.3v regulators too.- Shift registers, both parallel-to-serial, and serial-to-parallel. See the Arduino references for ShiftOut and ShiftIn for part numbers.- Spare AVR chips, like the ATmega328P and ATmega8A. If you want to do standalone Arduinos, get some 8 and 16MHz ceramic resonators with integrated caps (3-pin variety), or crystals with 27pF ceramic caps.- Pin headers -- lots of them, in like 36-position breakaway strips.- Breadboard wire kits. I can't possibly get enough of these. Also, those flexible pin-terminated wire jumpers that Adafruit sells are wonderful. As are the wire jumpers with alligator clamps.- Maybe some 5v and 12v relays that can handle 5A loads at 12-24v DC or 120v AC. (240v AC if applicable. )- LCD displays, sensors, and things like that. Browse Adafruit and Sparkfun and go nuts on whatever is easy to use, has sample code, and looks interesting.I have like ten parts bins full, plus stacks of Digikey boxes filled with anti-static bags, and things lying all over my work area. I've spent literally thousands at Digikey and Mouser over the past few years (I prefer Digikey's parametric search index, BTW), but you don't have to get everything all at once. Find some example projects and buy the parts you need for it, plus a few extra. Over time you'll gain a healthy collection of parts.The resistor kit is probably the most important initial investment, but after that, I just keep adding to my collection with every order for something specific. I may have even built something once with only parts on-hand, but that's pretty rare. ;-)For tools:- Good shear cutters are essential.- Wire strippers and cutters.- Weller temperature-controlled soldering stations are awesome, but a Radio Shack pencil iron will get you by. Don't forget solder, a sponge, and some wick.- I swear by my little Variac for testing PSUs and higher-power projects.- Of course, a multimeter. may i ask why exactly you chose the values of resistors, caps, diodes, transistors, etc that you did? What is it about each of those values\/types of components that make them better than the thousands of other choices?Also where can i buy storage containers to organize all this stuff!? That TOTALLY depends on what you do with your Arduino.Do you use it to light up LEDs? Drive motors? Build robots? Log analog values to SD cards...?\n\nEnjoy App-EXCLUSIVE Deals\nAfter SalesContact customer service for order status and other after-sales issues.

Arduino boards are open-source electronics platform that can be used to easily interface with hardware and sensors to expand the possibilities of your project. Arduino started in Italy in 2005. It has expanded over the years, with multiple manufacturers and distributors around the world. Arduino also has the Arduino IDE, the software that you use to program the board. The Arduino is a great educational tool to learn the basics of coding and electronics. There are lots of boards, starter kits, and shields to ensure that whatever your project is, you can find the parts for it. Arduino is simple enough that beginners can dive in easily, yet has enough options that advanced users can use it as well. The Arduino software can be used with any Windows, Linux or Mac computer. See the Official Arduino Introduction for a more in depth overview of the board. You can also see the Arduino Foundations page to get an idea of what’s involved in Arduino programming. Step 2: Which board do I use? Through the years, there have been many revisions of the Arduino board. We will go over a few key differences between the boards. You can see a full overview of all the Arduino products here: www.arduino.cc\/en\/Main\/Products\nThese boards are good for getting started with, and good for basic programming. Arduino Uno – Get it now! This is the basic beginners board. It has 14 digital input\/outputs (6 of which can be PWM pins), 6 analog inputs, and a 16MHz clock. This allows it to interface with a variety of sensors and applications. The Uno operates at 5V, and can be powered via the USB port, or it can take an input voltage of 6-20V (7-12 recommended) on the Vin pin. The 5V pin can supply 1A max for powering external sensors and outputs, if more then that is required you need an external power supply. If you try to draw more then 1A, the board will be damaged. The Arduino Uno measures 2.7″ by 2.1″. Arduino Micro – Get it now! The Arduino Micro is a small control board for when space is at a premium in your project. It measures 0.7″ by 1.9″. The Arduino Micro has many of the same specifications as the Uno, with a few differences. The Micro has 20 digital input\/output pins. 7 can be used as PWM pins, 12 as analog inputs. The serial communication with the computer is done differently, see the Arduino Leonardo board for more details. Arduino Pro\/Pro Micro\nThe Arduino Pro is a board with a few different versions.

By using the ethernet port, you can connect this board to the internet to open a whole new world of possibilities for your projects. The Arduino Yun is a very special board. First, is a combination of two processors. One processor runs the Arduino programs, and the other processor runs a Linux distribution that allows you to write shell and python scripts. Second, it has built in WiFi and Ethernet capabilities, to make it easy to connect your projects to the internet. Finally, it has a built in SD card reader to expand the storage space of your programs. The Yun has 20 digital input\/output pins (7 can be PWM), 12 analog inputs, and a 16MHz clock. It measures 2.09″ by 2.87″. Now that we’ve gone over all the Arduino boards, it’s time to move on to setting up the software! Step 3: Software Setup\nOnce you’ve picked your board, you need to install all the software and drivers so that you can start programming! Arduino has written the best getting started guide, see here for the various instructions for each board. Once all the drivers and the Arduino IDE is installed, you can begin programming. Before you can upload code, ensure that the correct board and port is selected. On the top menus, go to “Tools” – “Board”, and choose which board you are using. Then, go to “Tools” – “Port” and choose the port that corresponds to your Arduino. The getting started guide that is linked above has more information and troubleshooting options if you are having issues getting everything working. Step 4: Basic Examples\nThe easiest example to test your board is the “Blink” example. Most boards have a built in LED, so you can use the “Blink” example to make sure that you can upload code to the board. Find the example by opening the Arduino IDE, then going to “File” – “Examples” – “Basics” – “Blink”. You can change the Pin from 13 to whatever pin the LED is on on your board. The delay(1000) will pause the program for the specified amount of time. It is called in milliseconds, so 1000 means the program will pause for 1 second. Step 5: Conclusion\nWe learned how to get started using an Arduino in your project. Arduinos are a powerful, cost effective microcontroller that can be used in a variety of projects.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:7c5d5e43-7417-4570-8ecf-9acade1da1ed>"]},{"passage":"The long awaited ARM board by Arduino is finally here, now you can access higher level functionality while still using the wildly popular Arduino IDE. Warning: Unlike other Arduino boards, the Arduino Due board runs at 3.3V. The maximum voltage that the I\/O pins can tolerate is 3.3V. Providing higher voltages, like 5V to an I\/O pin could damage the board. If you are looking to interface 5V based product to the due we recommend using the Adafruit 8 channel bi-directional level converter. The Arduino Due is a microcontroller board based on the Atmel SAM3X8E ARM Cortex-M3 CPU (datasheet). It is the first Arduino board based on a 32-bit ARM core microcontroller. It has 54 digital input\/output pins (of which 12 can be used as PWM outputs), 12 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 84 MHz clock, an USB OTG capable connection, 2 DAC (digital to analog), 2 TWI, CAN bus, a power jack, an SPI header, a JTAG header, a reset button and an erase button. If you're curious to what the erase button does well it.....hmmm....how can we put this?....it swiftly eliminates the sketch you've uploaded to it....and in other terms: it erases your sketch. The board contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a micro-USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. The Due is compatible with Arduino shields that work at 3.3V and are compliant with the 1.0 Arduino pinout. Some interesting applications for the Due:\nFeatures and Specs:\n|Input Voltage (recommended)||7-12V|\n|Input Voltage (limits)||6-20V|\n|Digital I\/O Pins||54 (of which 12 provide PWM output)|\n|Analog Input Pins||12|\n|Analog Outputs Pins||2 (DAC)|\n|Total DC Output Current on all I\/O lines||130 mA|\n|DC Current for 3.3V Pin||800 mA|\n|DC Current for 5V Pin||800 mA|\n|Flash Memory||512 KB all available for user applications|\n|SRAM||96 KB (two banks: 64KB and 32KB)|\n|Clock Speed||84 MHz|\nThe Due follows the 1.0 pinout:\nThe Due has a dedicated forum for discussing the board. Here is the specification page for more info. Note: You will have download the newer Arduino 1.5 and above in order to have the Due board available in the IDE.

Arduino announces the release of the new Arduino Due board based on the Cortex M3 ARM processor\nThe release of the 1.0 Arduino platform in 2011 represented a milestone for Open Source Hardware: after six years of development, Arduino is declared mature and stable. Once this was achieved, the team applied itself to the new version of Arduino designed to provide more creative options to users. The result of this work is the Arduino Due, a board that provides increased performance and faster connectivity at an affordable price (49 USD MSRP). Arduino Due is ideal for those who want to build projects that require high computing power such as the remotely-controlled drones that, in order to fly, need to process a lot of sensor data per second. Arduino Due gives students the opportunity to learn the inner workings of the ARM processor in a cheaper and much simpler way than before. To Scientific projects, which need to acquire data quickly and accurately, Arduino Due provides a platform to create open source tools that are much more advanced than those available now. The new platform enables the open source digital fabrication community (3d Printers, Laser cutters, CNC milling machines) to achieve higher resolutions and faster speed with fewer components than in the past. Main features of Arduino Due\n• The board is equipped with a SAM3X8E processor from Atmel, based on the 32 bit ARM Cortex M3 architecture running at 84MHz. • USB 2.0 interface running at 480 Megabits that allows Arduino Due to act as a USB Host (so you can interface it to USB devices like mice, keyboards, cameras, mobile phones and more). Arduino Due supports the Android ADK 2012 protocol. • 12 analog inputs (ADC) with 12-bit resolution and high speed, opening the door to audio applications and signal processing projects that were impossible with Arduino Uno. • High-resolution Analog outputs (DAC). The board provides two 12-bit outputs that can be used to generate audio signals. The Arduino Due software comes with software examples for a WAV and OGG player. • 4 high-speed serial communication ports. • 70 input\/output pins. • High-speed CAN interface. The CAN protocol is used in the automotive industry to network the different components of the car, is now becoming popular in the field of industrial automation thanks to its speed and ability to withstand electrical noise. • 12 PWM channels. • 2 I2C bus.

However, there are pitfalls along the way. Sometimes researchers want so much to find a person that they ignore facts and make inaccurate connections. This guide will help you ask the questions that will help you decide if a person is, in fact, your ancestor. As you compare what you already know about your ancestor against the new information you find in a record, you can decide whether you have located your ancestor. What You Are Looking For\nYou are trying to decide if the person you found in a record is your ancestor. Once you have found a person in a record who may be your ancestor, the following 5 steps will help you determine if you have, in fact, found your ancestor. Step 1. Review what you already know about your ancestor. Do the following to identify your ancestor clearly:\n- Make a time line, listing known facts about your ancestor. - On your time line, include other persons associated with your ancestor. - Briefly give the source of your information. - Use an analysis chart to identify and evaluate what you know. - Evaluate what that information may suggest. See the following time line for an example of known information:\n|Time Line for My Ancestor: Daniel Currie Hill|\n|Source: All information is from A Dictionary of Scottish Emigrants To Canada Before Confederation, vols. 1 & 2.|\n|1807 Apr 2||Daniel Currie Hill born Johnstone, Renfrew, Scotland, son of Alexander Hill and Elizabeth Currie.|\n|1821 Apr 28||Daniel sailed with his parents and brothers and sisters on the Earl of Buckinghamshire from Greenock for Canada.|\n|1833||Daniel married Elizabeth Bryce.|\n|1835||Daniel moved to Tosorontio Twp., Simcoe Co., Ontario.|\n|1840||Daniel and his extended family moved to Nauvoo, Illinois, United States.|\n|1881 Jul 21||Daniel Currie Hill died in Utah, United States.|\nFor help in making a time line, see Tip 1.

The president of the United States awards the medal, on behalf of Congress, for members of the U.S. military who perform above the call of duty. There are three separate types of Medals of Honor; which one is given depends upon the recipient's branch of service. The Army and the Air Force each have their own medals, and the Navy, Marines and Coast Guard all award the same medal. As of July 2014, more than 3,400 military members have been awarded the Medal of Honor. The Distinguished Service Cross is awarded for extraordinary heroism that is above and beyond other service awards, yet not at the level of the Medal of Honor. This army award is equal to the Navy Cross and Air Force Cross. The Navy Cross is for members of the Navy, Marines and Coast Guard.Learn more about Military\n\nDefinition of Alberta\n1. Noun.

The southern and east-central parts of Alberta are covered by a short, nutritious grass, which dries up as summer lengthens, to be replaced by hardy perennials such as the buffalo bean, fleabane, and sagebrush. Both yellow and purple clover fill the ditches with their beauty and aromatic scents. The trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides. These are largely deciduous, typically birch, poplar, and tamarack. Many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain. On the north side of the North Saskatchewan River evergreen forests prevail for hundreds of thousands of square kilometers. Aspen poplar, balsam poplar (or cottonwood), and paper birch are the primary large deciduous species. Conifers include Jack pine, Rocky Mountain pine, Lodgepole pine, both white and black spruce, and the deciduous conifer tamarack. The First Nations settled the plains about 8,000 years ago, sustaining themselves by hunting the buffalo. Evidence of their activities can still be seen at Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump, which is now a World Heritage Site in southern Alberta. These peoples included the Blackfoot, Blood, and Peigan. Another group of First Nations, including the Woodland Cree and Chippewa tribes, settled the woodland areas of central Alberta. They hunted caribou and moose and fished the lakes and rivers, using bark canoes to travel. During the nineteenth century, European fur traders married Native women. The children of these marriages are called Métis (meaning \"mixed\"). Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park protects the largest concentration of rock art on the North American Plains. The first European arrived in what is now Alberta in 1754. Anthony Henday, a Hudson's Bay Company fur trader, came seeking a trading agreement with the First Nations that occupied the territory. Prior to this, Alberta was part of Rupert's Land from the time of the incorporation of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1670. For the next hundred years fur trading dominated most of Alberta. From the arrival of the North-West Company in 1731, communities began to arise. Fort La Jonquière was established near what is now Calgary in 1752. The North-West Company of Montreal occupied the northern part of Alberta territory before the Hudson's Bay Company arrived to take possession of it. The first explorer of the Athabasca region was Peter Pond, who, on behalf of the North-West Company of Montreal, built Fort Athabasca on Lac La Biche in 1778. Roderick Mackenzie built Fort Chipewyan on Lake Athabasca ten years later. His cousin, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, followed the North Saskatchewan River to its northernmost point near Edmonton, then on foot trekked to the Athabasca River, which he followed to Lake Athabasca. It was there he discovered the mighty outflow river that bears his name, which he followed to its outlet in the Arctic Ocean. Returning to Lake Athabasca, he followed the Peace River upstream, eventually reaching the Pacific Ocean. He thus became the first white man to cross the North American continent north of Mexico. To compete with Alexander Mackenzie, the Hudson's Bay Company sent out surveyors Peter Fidler and David Thompson to map and explore the Athabasca and Saskatchewan Rivers. By 1790, both companies had competing posts near and across what is now northern and central Alberta. With increased competition, however, came violence, and by 1821 with some persuasion from the British government, the North-West Company merged with the Hudson's Bay Company. By 1870, the fur trade industry was rapidly declining. On June 23, 1870, the Canadian government took possession of all HBC territory (Rupert’s Land), which included the area now known as Alberta. By the late 1850s, the Canadian government had hired John Palliser and his team to explore the arable lands of Alberta. The team, also known as the \"Palliser Expedition,\" discovered many coal deposits and passages through the Rocky Mountains appropriate for the construction of a railroad.\n\nGeography - Suggestions For Lessons\n( Originally Published 1915 )\nWHAT is a mountain? (Show a picture.) It is a very high hill. Very few hills in Ontario are high enough to be called mountains. How high must a hill be before it may be called a mountain? There is no fixed rule for using the term mountain. What is called a mountain in one part of the country would simply be called a hill in another. For example, in some localities a hill about 500 feet high is called a mountain; in other localities, it would need to be over 1,000 feet high to be considered as such. When we speak of the height of a mountain we mean its elevation above the level of the sea. Explain. Some mountains are so low and their slopes are so gentle that one may climb to their tops without much trouble. Others are so high and their sides are so steep that it is difficult and Often impossible to reach their tops. The height of the highest mountain in the world is about five and one-half miles. Their tops may rise far above the clouds and are often hidden by them. Examine as many pictures of mountains as you can find. What shape is the top of a mountain? It has many shapes—sometimes rounded, but often irregular. The top of a mountain that is much higher than the country about it is called a peak. What is the colour of the high mountain tops seen in pictures? Why are they white? They are covered with snow and ice. About two miles above us the atmosphere is so cold that snow will not melt. This is why very high mountain tops are always buried in snow and ice. A large mass of this snow and ice sometimes becomes loosened and slides down the mountain side causing great damage. This is called an avalanche. What name is given to a row of mountains? These ranges, or chains, are sometimes hundreds of miles in length. Why does such a mountain range make a good watershed, or divide? What becomes of the rain that falls upon a mountain range? Which side of the range will have the greater rainfall, the windward or the leeward side? Why? In what ways does a mountain range hinder trade and travel? Where is the best place for crossing a mountain range? What name is given to such a crossing place? It is called a pass. Why was this name given to it? Why do railways always cross mountains through these passes? Of what materials are mountains composed? Rock when exposed to the weather gradually crumbles away. What name is given to powdered rock? What becomes of the soil that is thus formed? Most of it is washed away and leaves the rocks bare; part of it covers the sides of the mountain farther down. This makes it possible for forests to grow on mountain sides. Do you see these forests in the pictures? Why can not trees grow on very high mountain tops? Metals, such as gold, silver, iron, etc., are usually found in rocks. Why are these metals so often found in mountainous countries? Why do fewer people live in mountainous countries than in lowland countries? How do mountaineers make their living? Do they cultivate the land much? Why not? They hunt, pasture sheep, work in mines, etc. What name is given to men who hunt? To those who care for sheep? To those who work in mines? Name some wild animals that live in the mountains. Why do many people go to the mountains for their health? Give reasons why most people find it more pleasant as well as more profitable to live in the valleys rather than up among the mountains? Make black-board sketches and sand and clay models of mountain, mountain range, pass, and valleys. Use -chalk dust to illustrate the snow-capped peaks. Make an examination of a brook near the school. Where does the water come from? Is there a spring, or a swamp, or a tile-drain in the neighbourhood? If so examine it carefully to find out what contribution, if any, it makes to the water-supply of the brook. In what direction is the brook flowing? Why does it flow in this direction? What is meant by the source of the brook? What is its mouth? What evidence can you find that the brook is growing larger as it flows along? What name is given to the smaller streams that flow into it? What is the name given to the land bordering each side of the brook?\n\nThe staff of the Historic Resources Management Branch wishes you a safe and joyous holiday season. We’ve worked hard to identify, protect and conserve Alberta’s historic resources this past year. We’d like to thank the countless people throughout Alberta for helping us to do that. Without your support, conserving our historic places would be impossible. RETROactive will be taking a break over the holidays — we will resume publishing on January 13th, 2014. We look forward to seeing you all in the New Year! An archaeological resource in Alberta is defined as “a work of humans that is of value for its prehistoric, historic, cultural or scientific significance” and is protected under the Historical Resources Act. Sites are classed into two major groups: prehistoric and historic. Over 80% of the sites in the province are prehistoric (which predate the arrival of Europeans); just over 10% are historic (postdating European arrival); and the rest are a mix of both prehistoric and historic, contemporary, indigenous historic (such as Metis sites), and natural sites. Some of the most common prehistoric sites are campsites; stone features; animal kill sites; processing sites; rock art sites and ceremonial sites, such as medicine wheels and cairns. Historic sites include trading posts, police posts, early settlements, homesteads, and industrial sites. Some of the oldest archaeological sites in Alberta date to as early as 13,000-8,000 years ago or what is known as the Palaeoindian Period. Prior to ~13,000 years ago what is now Alberta was covered by massive ice sheets that rendered the landscape uninhabitable. Shortly after the retreat of the ice sheets, however, animals and then people began moving into the area. At a site called Wally’s Beach in southern Alberta, archaeologists have recorded mammoth, camel and horse tracks. Not only that, they have discovered direct evidence of humans hunting these animals! Since then, what is now Alberta has been continuously occupied by numerous cultural groups, whose remnants we find in the form of discarded stone tools, butchered animal bones, hearths, broken pottery, buried palisade walls from forts and various other artifacts and features. These days the majority of new archaeological sites in Alberta are recorded by historic resource management consultants. Consulting companies are hired by developers in the province to carry out Historical Resource Impact Assessments, which involve the survey and testing of areas that will be affected by a proposed development for the potential or presence of archaeological sites. If a consultant deems an area to be high potential (judged by factors such as landforms, proximity to water bodies, and proximity to known sites, among other things) he or she will conduct surface inspection and possibly shovel testing (digging a hole about 40 cm by 40 cm in size) to search for archaeological artifacts or features. If results are positive, the information is submitted to the Archaeological Survey and a unique identifier, called a Borden number, is assigned to the site. The Archaeological Survey can then offer protection and management strategies for these sites. This could involve requirements for complete avoidance or excavation of the site prior to development. Archaeological site information is stored in the Alberta Archaeological Sites Inventory, an important resource for historic resource consultants and other researchers. Artifacts recovered from archaeological sites are stored at the Royal Alberta Museum where they are made accessible for research or put on display in one of their exhibits. Alberta’s archaeology may not be as visible as in other parts of the world, but we really do have a rich heritage and an abundance of archaeological resources — we just have to work a little harder to find them. It’s incredible what we can learn when we start digging into our past! Tell us, what’s your favourite archaeology site in Alberta?

Orders of Freedom of the Republic of Slovenia\nThe Orders of Freedom of the Republic of Slovenia (Slovene: Častni znaki svobode RS) are a special class of decorations \"for services rendered in the defence of freedom and assertion of the sovereignty of the Republic of Slovenia or only in connection with the said acts related to the gaining of independence.\" They are the highest civilian award given by the government of Slovenia. A majority of recipients of the Orders of Freedom were directly involved in Slovenia's struggle for independence from Yugoslavia, including the Ten-Day War which established their independence. There are three levels in the Orders of Freedom:\n- The Golden Order of Freedom (Slovene: Zlati častni znak svobode RS) is symbolised with a medal on a necklace. The medal is a gold version of the Order of Freedom medallion, on a blue ribbon necklace with tricolor stripes. The bar pin is also gold. - The Silver Order of Freedom (Slovene: Srebrni častni znak svobode RS) is symbolised the same way as the Order of Freedom, but the medallion and bar pins are silver. - The Order of Freedom (Slovene: Častni znak svobode RS) is symbolised by a small crystal medallion with a center medal in the tricolors of the Slovenian flag. Recipients also receive an aluminum bar pin with the Slovenian tricolors in the center. The Orders of Freedom were established by the Orders of Freedom of the Republic of Slovenia Act in 1992. Other Orders and Medals\nThe other orders and medals (Slovene: Redi in medalje) were established to honor works that advance Slovenia as a nation. With the exception of the highest honor, the Order of Exceptional Merits, they are split into three different categories, with a different medal design for each category: civil field, diplomatic and international field, and military or security field. These decorations were established by the Decorations of the Republic of Slovenia Act, instituted in 2004. Except for the Order of Exceptional Merits each field has a slightly different medal design. - The Order for Exceptional Merits (Slovene: Red za izredne zasluge) is \"for exceptional work and services rendered in advancing the sovereignty, prosperity, renown and progress of Slovenia.\" It is a white, blue and gold medal with a red dot at the center, suspended from a gold and red ribbon pin. It includes a gold and red bar pin. - The Golden Order for Merits (Slovene: Zlati red za zasluge) is \"for exceptional merits accomplished for Slovenia.\" Its medal is the same as the Order of Exceptional Merits, but is suspended on a yellow ribbon pin. It includes a yellow bar pin in addition. - The Silver Order for Merits (Slovene: Srebrni red za zasluge) is \"for exceptional work and services rendered in the security, defence and protection of the Republic of Slovenia and for international cooperation in these fields.\" Its medal is similar to the Golden Order, but has silver backing and a silver center shield, and is suspended from a blue ribbon pin. It includes a blue bar pin. - The Order for Merits (Slovene: Red za zasluge) is \"for services accomplished for the Republic of Slovenia in other fields.\" Its medal is similar to the Silver Order, but lacks the silver backing. - The Medal for Merits (Slovene: Medalja za zasluge) is \"for especially remarkable achievements and results in the fields marking an important contribution to the development and international standing of the Republic of Slovenia.\" Its medal is white with a blue backing and silver center shield, suspended on a blue ribbon pin with three horizontal gold stripes. Its bar pin is blue with three vertical gold stripes. - The Medal for Valour (Slovene: Medalja za hrabrost) is \"for personal valour and self-sacrifice in saving human lives and material goods.\" Its medal and bar pin are similar to the Medal for Merits, but have only two gold stripes. It is the only honor that does not have a provision for being conferred upon foreign nationals or organisations. - The Medal for Honourable Action (Slovene: Medalja za častna dejanja) is \"for exceptional actions worthy of particular distinction.\"","passages":[{"passage":"And while the hurting hasn’t stopped, she feels pride in knowing her son did the right thing, she said. “I’ve lost my son, but he became part of history.”\nThe highest honor\nThe Medal of Honor is the nation’s highest medal for valor in combat that can be awarded to members of the armed forces. It is sometimes referred to as the “Congressional Medal of Honor” because the president awards it on behalf of Congress. Because of the need for accuracy the recommendation process can take in excess of 18 months, with intense scrutiny every step of the way. The medal was first authorized in 1861 for sailors and Marines, and the following year for soldiers as well. Since then, more than 3,400 Medals of Honor have been awarded. Medals of Honor are bestowed only to the bravest of the brave, and that valor must be well-documented. So few Medals of Honor are awarded, in fact, that the only ones awarded after the Vietnam War were bestowed posthumously to Army Master Sgt. Gary I. Gordon and Army Sgt. 1st Class Randall D. Shughart for valor in Somalia in 1993, and posthumously to the most recent recipient, Sgt. 1st Class Paul R. Smith for valor in Iraq.

However, there are pitfalls along the way. Sometimes researchers want so much to find a person that they ignore facts and make inaccurate connections. This guide will help you ask the questions that will help you decide if a person is, in fact, your ancestor. As you compare what you already know about your ancestor against the new information you find in a record, you can decide whether you have located your ancestor. What You Are Looking For\nYou are trying to decide if the person you found in a record is your ancestor. Once you have found a person in a record who may be your ancestor, the following 5 steps will help you determine if you have, in fact, found your ancestor. Step 1. Review what you already know about your ancestor. Do the following to identify your ancestor clearly:\n- Make a time line, listing known facts about your ancestor. - On your time line, include other persons associated with your ancestor. - Briefly give the source of your information. - Use an analysis chart to identify and evaluate what you know. - Evaluate what that information may suggest. See the following time line for an example of known information:\n|Time Line for My Ancestor: Daniel Currie Hill|\n|Source: All information is from A Dictionary of Scottish Emigrants To Canada Before Confederation, vols. 1 & 2.|\n|1807 Apr 2||Daniel Currie Hill born Johnstone, Renfrew, Scotland, son of Alexander Hill and Elizabeth Currie.|\n|1821 Apr 28||Daniel sailed with his parents and brothers and sisters on the Earl of Buckinghamshire from Greenock for Canada.|\n|1833||Daniel married Elizabeth Bryce.|\n|1835||Daniel moved to Tosorontio Twp., Simcoe Co., Ontario.|\n|1840||Daniel and his extended family moved to Nauvoo, Illinois, United States.|\n|1881 Jul 21||Daniel Currie Hill died in Utah, United States.|\nFor help in making a time line, see Tip 1.

It was there he discovered the mighty outflow river that bears his name, which he followed to its outlet in the Arctic Ocean. Returning to Lake Athabasca, he followed the Peace River upstream, eventually reaching the Pacific Ocean. He thus became the first white man to cross the North American continent north of Mexico. To compete with Alexander Mackenzie, the Hudson's Bay Company sent out surveyors Peter Fidler and David Thompson to map and explore the Athabasca and Saskatchewan Rivers. By 1790, both companies had competing posts near and across what is now northern and central Alberta. With increased competition, however, came violence, and by 1821 with some persuasion from the British government, the North-West Company merged with the Hudson's Bay Company. By 1870, the fur trade industry was rapidly declining. On June 23, 1870, the Canadian government took possession of all HBC territory (Rupert’s Land), which included the area now known as Alberta. By the late 1850s, the Canadian government had hired John Palliser and his team to explore the arable lands of Alberta. The team, also known as the \"Palliser Expedition,\" discovered many coal deposits and passages through the Rocky Mountains appropriate for the construction of a railroad.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:9c34abd3-f430-40b6-92e2-89406e0499fa>"]},{"passage":"Geography - Suggestions For Lessons\n( Originally Published 1915 )\nWHAT is a mountain? (Show a picture.) It is a very high hill. Very few hills in Ontario are high enough to be called mountains. How high must a hill be before it may be called a mountain? There is no fixed rule for using the term mountain. What is called a mountain in one part of the country would simply be called a hill in another. For example, in some localities a hill about 500 feet high is called a mountain; in other localities, it would need to be over 1,000 feet high to be considered as such. When we speak of the height of a mountain we mean its elevation above the level of the sea. Explain. Some mountains are so low and their slopes are so gentle that one may climb to their tops without much trouble. Others are so high and their sides are so steep that it is difficult and Often impossible to reach their tops. The height of the highest mountain in the world is about five and one-half miles. Their tops may rise far above the clouds and are often hidden by them. Examine as many pictures of mountains as you can find. What shape is the top of a mountain? It has many shapes—sometimes rounded, but often irregular. The top of a mountain that is much higher than the country about it is called a peak. What is the colour of the high mountain tops seen in pictures? Why are they white? They are covered with snow and ice. About two miles above us the atmosphere is so cold that snow will not melt. This is why very high mountain tops are always buried in snow and ice. A large mass of this snow and ice sometimes becomes loosened and slides down the mountain side causing great damage. This is called an avalanche. What name is given to a row of mountains? These ranges, or chains, are sometimes hundreds of miles in length. Why does such a mountain range make a good watershed, or divide? What becomes of the rain that falls upon a mountain range? Which side of the range will have the greater rainfall, the windward or the leeward side? Why? In what ways does a mountain range hinder trade and travel? Where is the best place for crossing a mountain range? What name is given to such a crossing place? It is called a pass. Why was this name given to it? Why do railways always cross mountains through these passes? Of what materials are mountains composed? Rock when exposed to the weather gradually crumbles away. What name is given to powdered rock? What becomes of the soil that is thus formed? Most of it is washed away and leaves the rocks bare; part of it covers the sides of the mountain farther down. This makes it possible for forests to grow on mountain sides. Do you see these forests in the pictures? Why can not trees grow on very high mountain tops? Metals, such as gold, silver, iron, etc., are usually found in rocks. Why are these metals so often found in mountainous countries? Why do fewer people live in mountainous countries than in lowland countries? How do mountaineers make their living? Do they cultivate the land much? Why not? They hunt, pasture sheep, work in mines, etc. What name is given to men who hunt? To those who care for sheep? To those who work in mines? Name some wild animals that live in the mountains. Why do many people go to the mountains for their health? Give reasons why most people find it more pleasant as well as more profitable to live in the valleys rather than up among the mountains? Make black-board sketches and sand and clay models of mountain, mountain range, pass, and valleys. Use -chalk dust to illustrate the snow-capped peaks. Make an examination of a brook near the school. Where does the water come from? Is there a spring, or a swamp, or a tile-drain in the neighbourhood? If so examine it carefully to find out what contribution, if any, it makes to the water-supply of the brook. In what direction is the brook flowing? Why does it flow in this direction? What is meant by the source of the brook? What is its mouth? What evidence can you find that the brook is growing larger as it flows along? What name is given to the smaller streams that flow into it? What is the name given to the land bordering each side of the brook?","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:45991a6c-6298-4630-a734-9cd9d6521a99>"]},{"passage":"The staff of the Historic Resources Management Branch wishes you a safe and joyous holiday season. We’ve worked hard to identify, protect and conserve Alberta’s historic resources this past year. We’d like to thank the countless people throughout Alberta for helping us to do that. Without your support, conserving our historic places would be impossible. RETROactive will be taking a break over the holidays — we will resume publishing on January 13th, 2014. We look forward to seeing you all in the New Year! An archaeological resource in Alberta is defined as “a work of humans that is of value for its prehistoric, historic, cultural or scientific significance” and is protected under the Historical Resources Act. Sites are classed into two major groups: prehistoric and historic. Over 80% of the sites in the province are prehistoric (which predate the arrival of Europeans); just over 10% are historic (postdating European arrival); and the rest are a mix of both prehistoric and historic, contemporary, indigenous historic (such as Metis sites), and natural sites. Some of the most common prehistoric sites are campsites; stone features; animal kill sites; processing sites; rock art sites and ceremonial sites, such as medicine wheels and cairns. Historic sites include trading posts, police posts, early settlements, homesteads, and industrial sites. Some of the oldest archaeological sites in Alberta date to as early as 13,000-8,000 years ago or what is known as the Palaeoindian Period. Prior to ~13,000 years ago what is now Alberta was covered by massive ice sheets that rendered the landscape uninhabitable. Shortly after the retreat of the ice sheets, however, animals and then people began moving into the area. At a site called Wally’s Beach in southern Alberta, archaeologists have recorded mammoth, camel and horse tracks. Not only that, they have discovered direct evidence of humans hunting these animals! Since then, what is now Alberta has been continuously occupied by numerous cultural groups, whose remnants we find in the form of discarded stone tools, butchered animal bones, hearths, broken pottery, buried palisade walls from forts and various other artifacts and features. These days the majority of new archaeological sites in Alberta are recorded by historic resource management consultants. Consulting companies are hired by developers in the province to carry out Historical Resource Impact Assessments, which involve the survey and testing of areas that will be affected by a proposed development for the potential or presence of archaeological sites. If a consultant deems an area to be high potential (judged by factors such as landforms, proximity to water bodies, and proximity to known sites, among other things) he or she will conduct surface inspection and possibly shovel testing (digging a hole about 40 cm by 40 cm in size) to search for archaeological artifacts or features. If results are positive, the information is submitted to the Archaeological Survey and a unique identifier, called a Borden number, is assigned to the site. The Archaeological Survey can then offer protection and management strategies for these sites. This could involve requirements for complete avoidance or excavation of the site prior to development. Archaeological site information is stored in the Alberta Archaeological Sites Inventory, an important resource for historic resource consultants and other researchers. Artifacts recovered from archaeological sites are stored at the Royal Alberta Museum where they are made accessible for research or put on display in one of their exhibits. Alberta’s archaeology may not be as visible as in other parts of the world, but we really do have a rich heritage and an abundance of archaeological resources — we just have to work a little harder to find them. It’s incredible what we can learn when we start digging into our past! Tell us, what’s your favourite archaeology site in Alberta?

Orders of Freedom of the Republic of Slovenia\nThe Orders of Freedom of the Republic of Slovenia (Slovene: Častni znaki svobode RS) are a special class of decorations \"for services rendered in the defence of freedom and assertion of the sovereignty of the Republic of Slovenia or only in connection with the said acts related to the gaining of independence.\" They are the highest civilian award given by the government of Slovenia. A majority of recipients of the Orders of Freedom were directly involved in Slovenia's struggle for independence from Yugoslavia, including the Ten-Day War which established their independence. There are three levels in the Orders of Freedom:\n- The Golden Order of Freedom (Slovene: Zlati častni znak svobode RS) is symbolised with a medal on a necklace. The medal is a gold version of the Order of Freedom medallion, on a blue ribbon necklace with tricolor stripes. The bar pin is also gold. - The Silver Order of Freedom (Slovene: Srebrni častni znak svobode RS) is symbolised the same way as the Order of Freedom, but the medallion and bar pins are silver. - The Order of Freedom (Slovene: Častni znak svobode RS) is symbolised by a small crystal medallion with a center medal in the tricolors of the Slovenian flag. Recipients also receive an aluminum bar pin with the Slovenian tricolors in the center. The Orders of Freedom were established by the Orders of Freedom of the Republic of Slovenia Act in 1992. Other Orders and Medals\nThe other orders and medals (Slovene: Redi in medalje) were established to honor works that advance Slovenia as a nation. With the exception of the highest honor, the Order of Exceptional Merits, they are split into three different categories, with a different medal design for each category: civil field, diplomatic and international field, and military or security field. These decorations were established by the Decorations of the Republic of Slovenia Act, instituted in 2004. Except for the Order of Exceptional Merits each field has a slightly different medal design. - The Order for Exceptional Merits (Slovene: Red za izredne zasluge) is \"for exceptional work and services rendered in advancing the sovereignty, prosperity, renown and progress of Slovenia.\" It is a white, blue and gold medal with a red dot at the center, suspended from a gold and red ribbon pin. It includes a gold and red bar pin. - The Golden Order for Merits (Slovene: Zlati red za zasluge) is \"for exceptional merits accomplished for Slovenia.\" Its medal is the same as the Order of Exceptional Merits, but is suspended on a yellow ribbon pin. It includes a yellow bar pin in addition. - The Silver Order for Merits (Slovene: Srebrni red za zasluge) is \"for exceptional work and services rendered in the security, defence and protection of the Republic of Slovenia and for international cooperation in these fields.\" Its medal is similar to the Golden Order, but has silver backing and a silver center shield, and is suspended from a blue ribbon pin. It includes a blue bar pin. - The Order for Merits (Slovene: Red za zasluge) is \"for services accomplished for the Republic of Slovenia in other fields.\" Its medal is similar to the Silver Order, but lacks the silver backing. - The Medal for Merits (Slovene: Medalja za zasluge) is \"for especially remarkable achievements and results in the fields marking an important contribution to the development and international standing of the Republic of Slovenia.\" Its medal is white with a blue backing and silver center shield, suspended on a blue ribbon pin with three horizontal gold stripes. Its bar pin is blue with three vertical gold stripes. - The Medal for Valour (Slovene: Medalja za hrabrost) is \"for personal valour and self-sacrifice in saving human lives and material goods.\" Its medal and bar pin are similar to the Medal for Merits, but have only two gold stripes. It is the only honor that does not have a provision for being conferred upon foreign nationals or organisations. - The Medal for Honourable Action (Slovene: Medalja za častna dejanja) is \"for exceptional actions worthy of particular distinction.\"","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:c294cc97-cfc5-4d09-8d02-722f28cea566>"]}]}

I realize that it’s probably because she just doesn’t know what to say, but I also have come to feel the frustration that comes with hearing the same response all the time. That’s when I began to think about why people say that they’re sorry, and I’ve come to realize that it’s probably one of the most over-used words. Why is it that we are at a loss for words, that we turn to an expression that is used to show sympathy or to apologize? Sorry is defined as feeling regret, sadness, and pity. The last thing that I want to feel is pity from anyone, but it still doesn’t answer the reason why sorry is so often overused. It’s a reflex that sends the wrong message. It’s not said that when we need to own up to being responsible for our actions, we rely on saying sorry to fill the gap of awkwardness when being told of news that affects someone else. Sorry finds its way into statements that don’t have anything to do with feeling remorse. One of the most concerning issues is that apologizing too much can lead to a person sounding insincere. As a strategy for being polite, sorry has become the go-to word for keeping the peace without sounding too passive-aggressive. By changing to words such as thank you, we immediately can change the tone of our message to one that is positive. Apologizing for simply existing isn’t enough. Instead, changing the words we use can make a difference in our conversations and our relationships with each other is more beneficial, and what is meant to be. Rather than staying in the habit of saying sorry, we can practice using words that give real meaning to what we are feeling and putting the unnecessary apologies away for when they are most needed. Over-apologizing has become a common way of reacting to those around us. What many may not realize is how we lessen its meaning and its value, the more that we say we’re sorry. It can also show low-esteem and that we fear confrontation. Remembering that unless we have done something that is our fault, finding words that express what the other person may need, such as encouragement, could be the better option than saying I’m sorry.\n\nI recently found myself in a situation where I needed to apologize to someone I hurt. I was conflicted, my thoughts filled with self-justifying righteousness, “I am right, and I am hurt, too!” Yet at the same time, I was filled with regret, choking on unfinished words and self-reproach. “This isn’t turning out the way I want it to,” I said to myself. Ugh…the only way to get myself out of my self-inflected situation was to say, “I’m sorry.”\nApologizing is difficult, especially when the stakes are high and the hurt runs deep. It’s easy to let yourself off the hook, blaming the other person and minimizing your role in the situation. When you finally bring yourself to say the words, stress hormones flood the body creating fight or flight responses. Your brain screams, “Don’t do it! Run!” or “Get mad! Don’t go down without a fight!” It’s takes everything in your power to go through with it. Your mind spins as you think of the million ways to express yourself. But in the end, it’s worth it. When you apologize, it allows space for both you and the other person to move forward, to let go, to forgive. It will make you and the other person feel better. So how do you apologize the right way? Write Down the Outcomes You Want\nBefore you go into a high stress situation, know what you want to get out of it. Write down your desired outcomes and keep them handy during the conversation; it will help you stay on track if the person responds emotionally and you can review them if you find yourself getting emotional or making excuses. Examples of outcomes might be to repair a damaged relationship, defuse an emotional situation, or simply to own your part in a conflict. Check Your Emotions. Choose How You Want to Feel\nEmotions don’t have to dictate your feelings and reactions. Even when they are strong, you can still choose how you want to feel. You can choose to feel compassion, relief, or ownership. Or you can also choose to feel angry, justified, or shameful. It’s up to you to determine your outlook on the situation, so check your emotions and choose to see the bright side of apologizing. Apologize. Own it. Don’t Over Explain Your Actions\nIt’s best to just say, “I am sorry; I own what I did.” Most people don’t want to hear excuses because they water down the apology and make it feel insincere. Sometimes though, it may be appropriate to explain your side, but only do it to help the person forgive, not to minimize your role in what happened. Over explaining sounds like excuse making. Express Regret, Be Specific\nIn addition to saying, “I’m sorry,” you should express regret for hurting the other person. For example, “I regret hurting you; it was wrong of me to blame you and it damaged our relationship. Our relationship is important to me and I understand that I have to earn your trust back.” This validates the person’s feelings which is what most people want out of an apology. Being specific brings a tone of sincerity and it shows you understand how your actions affected the person. Ask Questions and Listen\nRemember, the person you are apologizing to isn’t there to only hear you out. Give him or her the opportunity to respond. Ask questions to draw out meaningful dialogue, listen carefully and don’t get defensive. Make Commitments and Keep Them\nAfter you’ve apologized and expressed regret, make a commitment to change your behavior. Outline what you are going to do differently and follow through. Everyone makes mistakes but there is nothing worse than repeating it because you didn’t change your behavior. Trust can be rebuilt quickly if you demonstrate that you’ve learned from what happened. Smile, Say Thank You and Leave\nAt the end of your apology, smile. Smiling makes everyone feel better and it releases tension. Thank the person for listening and then leave. Most people need time to process and hanging around afterwards doesn’t allow the space required to do so. Following these steps will help you deliver a sincere, meaningful apology and will start the process of forgiveness. As famous cartoonist Lynn Johnson famously wrote, “An apology is the super glue of life. It can repair just about anything.”\nThanks for reading and as always, I appreciate comments, likes and shares! We all have high maintenance people in our lives.\n\nThey're Not Just for Children\nWe learned them as children, but no mater your age these essential words are effortless to say and convey a wealth of meaning to others. They have a powerful ability to create positive interactions, so look for opportunities to use them every day. Using “please” expresses both respect and consideration for those with whom we’re interacting because it changes a command into a request. It sets the tone for whatever follows and is one of most important universal manners. “Thank You” and “You’re Welcome”\nMost people know to express their thanks for gifts, favors, awards, and the like. But we sometimes fail to recognize and show appreciation for the everyday courtesies that come our way, such as when someone holds the door or lets us go ahead in line. Expressing thanks for these little services is a hallmark of civility. When someone says, “thank you,” the best response is, “you’re welcome.” Don’t be bashful—accept the credit for your kindness. It’s subtle, but an “it was nothing” is actually saying that you place no value on what you did. By accepting thanks graciously you can also encourage the “thank-you” habit. “Excuse me,” “pardon me,” and “I beg your pardon” all express your awareness that you’ve inconvenienced someone else. Make it a habit to excuse yourself whenever you do the following:\n- Make a necessary interruption: “Excuse me, but you have a phone call.”\n- Make a request: “Excuse me, but this is the non-smoking section.”\n- Acknowledge an error: “Excuse me. I didn’t realize that you were already waiting in line.”\n- Acknowledge a faux pas, such as burping: “Excuse me.”\n- Leave a conversation: “Excuse me, I wish I could chat longer, but I have to leave now.”\n- Get up from the table: “Please excuse me.”\nMaking and accepting apologies gracefully are acts of courtesy and maturity, and they are important for matters both big and small. Sincere apologies can defuse volatile situations; it’s hard for most people to remain angry with someone who takes responsibility for his own actions. “I’m sorry” is also one of the simplest and often kindest ways to express sympathy or regret. A job loss, an illness, a death in the family, or the loss of a pet are all times when you might say sorry. At these times, keep it simple—you don’t need to elaborate if you aren’t sure what else to say.\n\nKnowing the secrets of a really good apology can mean the difference between this:\nMost of us learned to apologize back when we were in preschool and as far as I can tell, few people have upgraded their approach since then. Remember the drill? You whacked some girl with your shovel or you yanked the cat’s tail and before you had time to enjoy what you’d done some looming grown-up was pressuring you to say you were sorry. So you took a deep breath and, contrite or not, you managed to squeak out a barely audible “sorry.”\nWith that, thank goodness, the ordeal was over. An apology like this is lacking, well… just about everything that a Class-A apology needs. An apology is worth very little if it’s been extracted, rather than given. If your M.O. is to “demand” an apology, rethink your strategy. A well-executed, sincere apology feels like a gift to the receiver. Once you’ve experienced the real thing, you’ll clearly know the difference. Worse still is an apology that is an attack or a criticism in disguise. Here are some common apology blunders to eliminate from your repertoire:\n“I’m sorry that you’re so sensitive.”\n“I’m sorry if…”\n“I’m sorry that it pissed you off when I did the thing you always do.”\n“You want an apology? Fine, here’s an apology.”\nAny of these moves sound familiar? If so, I bet you aren’t winning rave reviews for your effort. Ready for an alternative? Step 1- Mean what you say\nThe key ingredient to making a truly standout apology is that you actually have to be sorry. This is essential. You may not have been sorry for stealing your sister’s cupcake when you were six. But by the time you’re, say, forty-six, if you forgot to pick your daughter up from her saxophone lesson or you didn’t close the sunroof and the car is knee-deep in rain, unless you’re a sociopath, chances are you feel sorry and you’re ready to say so. Step 2- Articulate exactly what it is that you’re sorry for\n“I’m sorry I left the cat door unlocked… I overspent at Nordstrom’s… I forgot to pick up the dry cleaning… I drank too much at your office party… I made a joke that embarrassed you.”\nI’m not suggesting that you have to wear a hair shirt or fall on your knees. I’m simply suggesting that you look yourself in the eye and be prepared to admit what you’ve done. Step 3- Self-reflect\nA slightly better-than-average apology is consists of Steps 1 and 2, but if you’re going for the gold, you’ll have to do some soul-searching about what led to your misstep in the first place. One client I worked with refused to keep a calendar, insisting he didn’t need one. Yet, time and again, he missed important meetings, especially with his partner. His new and improved apology included an admission of being both dishonest with himself about his imperfect memory and inconsiderate of the impact that his self-deception had on others. Another client who was consistently late, admitted that she felt entitled to have her lateness overlooked because she was such a kind and generous mother. This, she said sheepishly, had prevented her from making any apology at all. Step 4- Seek ways to improve your performance. Even the most heartfelt and thorough apology isn’t worth much if you turn right around and do the exact same thing again. A winning apology includes a commitment to change. Sounds difficult? Consider this. We all make mistakes, but here’s no reason for your apology to be an additional one. Why not give it a try? I’d love to hear how it goes.

How many times a day do we\/I\/you use this word???? Sorry has all kinds of meanings:\n--Grieved for the loss of some good; pained for some evil; feeling regret; -- now generally used to express light grief or affliction, but formerly often used to express deeper feeling. --Melancholy; dismal; gloomy; mournful; (She is in a sorry mood today!) --Poor; mean; worthless; (That is a sorry excuse.). I can only speak for myself, but I know that I seem to constantly use the word.. I 'am' a pleaser --especially to my sweet husband, and whenever I think I've done (or do) something crazy or stupid, I apologize BIGTIME. \"I'm sorry that I walk so slowly.\" \"I am sorry that I complain about my aches and pains so much.\" I feel so sorry for you---having to put up with a moody female like me.\" Just think about it... I seem to apologize ALOT. Do you???? Then, there's always the problem when someone 'does' say \"I'm Sorry\" that makes one wonder if they really are sorry ---or whether they are just using words that mean nothing...???? An apology that means nothing is worse I think than no apology at all. Why is it that some people seem to apologize ALOT and others never seem to say \"I'm Sorry\"???? Maybe, saying \"I'm Sorry\" has a different meaning to some than it does to others. Maybe --some of the problem has to do with 'forgiveness' (which is another blog)! All of these thoughts made me do some research on the word, SORRY. I read on www.brainyquote.com MANY different quotes from people using the word, sorry. It's interesting how the word has so many meanings and interpretations. If you want to know who said some of these quotes listed below, click HERE. It is interesting! See if you can guess which one of these quotes was said by Monica Lewinsky. (Har Har)\n--I don't like it, and I'm sorry I ever had anything to do with it. --I can just tell you that I'm sorry for what happened, and I think people understand that. --Love is never having to say you are sorry. --Love in the real world means saying you're sorry 10 times a day. --And I felt sorry, and I have felt bad about what happened. --If love means never having to say you're sorry, then marriage means always having to say everything twice. --All successful people these days seem to be neurotic. Perhaps we should stop being sorry for them and start being sorry for me - for being so confounded normal. --There's no room in my life for feeling sorry for myself. --You may be sorry that you spoke, sorry you stayed or went, sorry you won or lost, sorry so much was spent. But as you go through life, you'll find - you're never sorry you were kind. --Grab a chance and you won't be sorry for a might-have-been. --Most truths are so naked that people feel sorry for them and cover them up, at least a little bit. --If you're going to do something tonight that you'll be sorry for tomorrow morning, sleep late. --Affliction comes to us, not to make us sad but sober; not to make us sorry but wise. --I can wholeheartedly apologize for not being at all sorry. And it really is the least I can do. --Let us live so that when we come to die even the undertaker will be sorry.\n\nIn these cases you contribute something else to the person you harmed. You can work it out with them to figure out what would be acceptable. You might also make restitution to show others that you are a good person. This line of thought comes from the virtue signaling ethic, and while it is great that you are doing the right thing, this is not the best way too apologize. It could lead you to think that you can just balance your bad deeds with good deeds, but this idea fails to strengthen the bonds that you have with others. Language 3: Request Forgiveness\nWhen you request forgiveness from someone you are showing them that their opinion really matters to you, and you want to rebuild the relationship that you have with them. This follows the negotiation ethic which states that you should change your social contracts in order to benefit everyone involved in them. When you request forgiveness you recognize that your actions went against the best interest of the person you wronged, and that you should have received their permission before acting. The autonomy ethic states that you should change your values in order to bolster your identity depending on each scenario. If you request forgiveness not because you care about what the other person thinks, but to avoid retribution from them, then you are following this ethic. This request for forgiveness is not a heartfelt apology because you are only thinking of yourself. Language 4: Accept Responsibility\nThe responsibility ethic states that you should change your social contracts in order to help the people you lead. When you accept the responsibility for your actions you try to manage the consequences of your actions. This shows the people that you have wronged that you still want to help them. You don't want your actions to be a burden to them. The branding ethic states that you should change your values in order to best embody the things you represent. If you take responsibility of your actions so that you can save your image this is a great thing to do, but it isn't a great apology. It shows people that you care about yourself more than the people that you harmed. Language 5: Expressing Regret\nWhen you express regret for your behavior you are being accountable to others. This follows the fifth relationship ethic which states that you must hold other people accountable for their actions by telling them how their actions have influenced others. When you express regret you tell the person you have wronged that you realize how much your actions have hurt them, and let them know that you wish you hadn't hurt them because of how much they mean to you. The self assessment ethic is the opposing ethic it states that you should evaluate your own behavior, and determine if it is actually beneficial to you. You might feel bad because you realize that your behavior is wrong and it is hurting you. But this regret is not an apology, because you don't have anyone to express it to. If you do express regret to someone because you realize that your actions are hurting yourself you will seem insincere. They will probably be like the kid with terrible drawing skills, and claim you aren't actually sorry, just sorry that your actions caught up to you. Although there are several ways to apologize, not all of the methods are necessary every time. For instance the kid whose feelings I hurt seemed to be fine after I expressed regret, and I stopped hurting his feelings. Something that I did not talk about is the relationship between personality, and apology methods. Gary Chapman's work focusses on this topic a lot, and suggests that for some people one of the apology methods will resonate with them far better than the others. One other thing that I wanted to point out is that the different apology methods are also the steps of repentance. So repentance is making an apology to God for the sins that you committed against Him. Its purpose is to initiate the rebuilding of your relationship with God. If done properly both repentance and apologizing will lead you to become a better person, and they will allow God and others to regain their trust in you.\n\nRecently, I've heard a slew of apologies. Paula Deen said “sorry” for her racist behavior, Anthony Weiner took responsibility (kind of) for airing his privates once again, Riley Cooper swore he’d learned from his racist mistakes, and the barista at my local coffee shop apologized profusely for not having the coffee flavor I love. It seems like everyone — celebrities and regular Joes and Janes alike — has apology fever. In fact, some psychologists and business experts note the U.S. has developed what they dub an “apology culture,” in which people of all professions, from CEOs to physicians, are apologizing more frequently. Blame lawsuit culture, a society based on shame, or whatever you will: Everybody’s doing it. But do apologies actually help reconcile hurt feelings, or can they make things worse? Is there a “right” or “wrong” way to deliver an apology? Science helps us navigate America’s newest hobby. The Right Way to Say It\nWhether it’s via an appearance on a morning news show, a dozen long-stemmed roses, or standing outside someone’s window with a boom box blaring Akon’s Put the Blame on Me, there are approximately a million ways to apologize. But, as we’ve learned from both public figures (think Mel Gibson and Anthony Weiner) and, most likely, our own personal experiences, not all apologies are equally effective. Unfortunately, experts haven't settled on one specific set of criteria for the \"perfect apology\". Some sources maintain there are four key components to an apology, while others claim as many as seven factors must be present in order for an apology to work. What each of these theories has in common is the idea that a meaningful apology should include clear acknowledgment and explanation of the offense, an expression of regret or shame, and a commitment to making reparations or providing compensation (whether monetary or symbolic). This doesn’t seem like rocket science, but, in fact, many apologies lack even these basic parts. When Serena Williams blasted a line judge about an unfair call at the 2009 U.S. Open, her apology was everything but apologetic, lacking a clear statement of regret and failing to address the line judge’s feelings. Though Paula Deen’s first apology was a tearful cry for forgiveness, by generalizing her actions as “mistakes I have made” and the “wrong that I have done,” she failed to say what she’s sorry for and acknowledge the feelings of the offended parties. Of course, we can't know whether the offended parties appreciated the apologies regardless. But what these examples highlight is the fact that it's easy to overlook some of the core factors in what research dubs the most meaningful \"sorry\". An apology doesn’t have to be an elaborate song and dance, but the most effective ones take more than just slapping together a few slick words and shedding some tears. Better Safe and Sorry\nEven if saying “sorry” is a little tough, owning up to mistakes yields some pretty great perks. Research has found that apologies promote reconciliation between the two quarreling parties and can restore trust when the offender takes responsibility for their actions Removing the shadow of suspicion: the effects of apology versus denial for repairing competence-versus integrity-based trust violations. Kim, P.H., Ferrin, D.L., Cooper C.D., et al. Department of Management and Organization, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA. Journal of Applied Psychology, 2004; 89(1):104-18. . A sincere apology can produce positive health effects for the victim, including a reduction in anger-induced high blood pressure Influence of apologies and trait hostility on recovery from anger. Anderson, J.C., Linden, W., Habra, M.E. The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. Journal of Behavioral Medicine, 2006; 29(4):347-58. . In the workplace, employees who receive effective apologies reported higher job satisfaction, less anger, and greater self-esteem When forgiving enhances psychological well-being: the role of interpersonal commitment. Karremans, J.C., Van Lange, P.A., Ouwerkerk, J.W., et al.\n\nIt would be impossible for the seven billion of us living on planet Earth not to tread on each other’s toes and rub each other up the wrong way from time to time. So, when it happens, how can we best deal with it in order to repair the situation? When to apologise (and when not to)\nFor some, “sorry” is the hardest word to say, while for others, the word spills from their lips with such frequency it appears to be their default response to anything that happens. If you’re in the latter category, I recommend you give some thought to why this is. What are you apologising for? Are you actually responsible for whatever has gone wrong? I’m thinking here of the times I’ve apologised for stuff that nobody could logically consider my fault, such as when my cousin came to visit me and it rained. Because as I was growing up I felt myself blamed for all sorts of things that were far outside my control, I continue to feel the impulse to seek forgiveness for practically any negative event that takes place around me. It’s an impulse I need to resist, for several reasons. An endless stream of apologies can be irritating, prompting the people on the receiving end to react in one of two ways: either they will feel obliged to keep reassuring the apologiser, when they might more usefully be concentrating on sorting out the problem, or they may buy into the grovelling and start berating the apologiser for whatever has transpired, whether or not it was her fault. Constant apologising can backfire and, in any case, the guilt and shame that accompany it are corrosive. However, this is not to say you should never apologise unless you have personally and deliberately done someone down. Not taking responsibility when the buck stops with you is even worse than assuming responsibility for events outside your control. It is the antithesis of leadership, integrity and courage – and it rarely fools anybody anyway. If I go into a busy restaurant, for example, where I have booked a table and the waiter says he has no record of my booking and there is no table available, I will feel far more mollified if he apologises and offers to make amends, rather than blaming the mistake on junior staff and shrugging it off. In some circumstances, it can take a lot of strength and confidence to apologise for an unintended consequence of something you’ve done, but in my experience it can be a healing and immensely helpful thing to do. What I have in mind here is the times my partner inadvertently upsets me. In some areas, I’m extremely sensitive and easily distressed and, when everything is fine, I accept I have to take responsibility for this and not force those around me to walk on eggshells. Once the wrong button has been pushed, though, I find it very hard not to react in childish ways, either crying and screaming in rage or withdrawing and hiding in fear. With most people, this behaviour tends simply to escalate the situation, as they feel threatened and defend themselves either by whinging (this is how it feels to me at the time) about how this isn’t their fault and I’m being unfair, or by attacking me back. I thank God that my man has the wisdom and strength to respond to me as the child I become in that state. He tells me calmly, gently and sincerely that he’s sorry for whatever it was he said or did that upset me. He puts his arms around me and we talk about it till it’s all over. He learns from each incident and never makes the same mistake twice, and gradually I’m learning too that I can trust him and need to deal with these things in a more grown-up way. How to apologise\nThe thing to remember when you’re apologising is that it’s for the other person’s benefit, not yours. If the purpose of your saying sorry is purely to elicit absolution from the wronged party, spare a thought in advance for how you may feel if absolution is not forthcoming. If your transgression has been serious, you may need to give the other person some time and space to process what has happened before you can expect a move towards forgiveness – but just because you don’t receive it immediately it doesn’t mean you will never get it. A meaningful apology, one that can repair the damage, obviously has to come from the heart.\n\nBy Dianna Booher\nWhy won’t the latest celebrity flap go away? Situations calling for a public apology come and go about once a month. Some rock star, movie actor, athlete, or politician gets caught shoplifting, driving while drunk, doing drugs, having an affair, uttering prejudicial slurs over an open mic, or taking a bribe, and the public becomes outraged about the duplicity. The public persona and principles preached don’t match the private behavior. What further enrages us about such situations is that typically the celebrity involved first takes the stance: “It’s none of your business.” When that line doesn’t work, he or she tries to make excuses, “I was drunk\/stoned\/conned\/didn’t know that blah, blah, blah . . .”—fill in the blanks. When those excuses don’t calm the waters, the person finally comes out with a belated apology. Life goes back to normal. We once again buy the person's music, or see his movies, or go to his ball games, or elect him or her to office. There’s only one exception to this rule: If the celebrity tries to offer a pseudoapology, one with no real admission of wrongdoing. (For familiar examples, see below.) When that’s the case, the media and public chew on the story until the celebrity spits out an admission of guilt. Only then does life resume for the wronged and the harangued. Ditto at the office. People have difficulty offering an outright apology—an expression of “I’m concerned because I made a mistake\/I did something wrong.” And they get the same kind of reaction as celebrities do to their pseudoapologies. What makes a good apology? 1. Admission of error, guilt, or wrongdoing. The person accepts responsibility for what was said or done and its inappropriateness, inaccuracy, weakness, hurtfulness, insensitivity, or whatever. 2. Specificity. Apologizing specifically sounds sincere. Global, blanket apologies convey lack of concern or understanding of the situation or damage caused. 3. Amends. Apologizing typically involves some attempt to make things right, some words or gesture of goodwill toward the offended person or group. Children learn these steps before they learn to count. But medical schools and hospitals are increasingly adding “How to Apologize” to their curriculum for grown-ups to learn as ways to head off malpractice lawsuits. According to a story by the Associated Press, the hospitals in the University of Michigan Health System have been encouraging doctors to apologize for mistakes. As a result, the system’s annual attorney fees, malpractice lawsuits, and notices of intent to sue have fallen dramatically. An admission of wrongdoing isn’t always appropriate, of course. But you can express regret over a situation, results, or an outcome no matter who or what caused it. Failure to admit mistakes leads to outrage. Failure to express concern leads to bitterness. Survivors, even dying victims, forgive mistakes; they don’t forgive unconcern. Concern connects people. In whatever situation—from product recall to layoffs to employee illness to accident victims to stressed colleagues—there’s tremendous power in communicating your concern. When logic causes a lapse in the relationship, emotion closes the gap. Psuedoapologies That Alienate\nApology, Plus Denial\n“No, I didn’t e-mail the meeting agenda to everyone ahead of time. I apologize—I didn’t know I was supposed to do that.”\nTranslation: I’m not in error here. Whoever was in charge of telling me to do that screwed up—not me. Apology, Plus Good Intentions\n“I’ve been putting out fires all morning ever since I came in at 6:30, but I won’t bore you with the details. So I apologize that I didn’t e-mail the meeting agenda to everyone ahead of time.”\nTranslation: I had good intentions, so please give me some credit for those. Besides that, I’m busier than most of you. Apology, Plus Excuse\n“I apologize for not e-mailing the meeting agenda to everyone ahead of time. It’s just been my experience that nobody ever looks at them ahead of time anyway.”\nTranslation: There’s no reason to apologize then.\n\nThe other night my two-year-old son wanted me to get a step stool out of the closet. As I was lifting it out of the storage space, he reached for it and his littlest pinky finger got pinched in the hinge that connects the sides of the ladder as it opens. Yikes! I put the step ladder down, scooped him up and said, “I’m so sorry.”\nI wanted to say, “But you need to wait til I get it all the way out.” And “That’s why these things are grown-up things.” And probably 15 other things in order to make myself feel better because I very much didn’t like being responsible for an action that pinched his finger. But I didn’t ,because I remember listening to a podcast with psychologist Harriet Lerner on Brené Brown’s Unlocking Us series that was like a master class on apologies. It was 2 years ago and so well done that I still remember some talking points. One being “When ‘but’ is tagged on to an apology, it undoes the sincerity.” If there is a genuine counter point or excuse to the apology, it needs to happen as a separate conversation. So I looked up some more details from Dr. Lerner’s book, Why Won’t You Apologize: Healing Big Betrayals and Every Day Hurts. She notes there are cultural differences when it comes to apologies. There are also gender differences – males are more likely to be non-apologizers, women are more likely to be over-apologizers. But for anyone trying to craft a sincere apology, here are some pointers she provides of things not to do:\n- Saying I’m sorry you feel that way: These are apologies that don’t address what happened but instead try to target the emotions of the other party. - The “IF” apology: I’m sorry IF you thought is a weaselly effort to not own what happened. - The mystifying apology: What is it that the apologizer just said? Apologies that usually are too wordy and talk around the issue, leave the other party feeling confused. - The apology as instant expectation of forgiveness: I apologize now you must forgive me is a quid pro quo that undermines the apology as a genuine offering and not just a means to an end. - Not listening: If we don’t hear the injured party out, they will not feel heard and any apology will fall short of the entire wound. So what is a good apology? A simple statement expressing remorse for the action we are apologizing for, owning what we did, not taking more that our share of blame (because that comes across as insincere) and not trying to speak to how the other person feels. Just thumbing this book reminded me of some old wounds that I was surprised to find hadn’t fully healed over because I can still think of the poor apologies I’ve received. The down-played sorry – “I’m sorry that I called you a ‘brat’ when I was feeling crappy” when that wasn’t the word used at all. The blame-shifting excuse: “I was feeling sick, what was I to do?” when someone no-showed\/no-called to the birthday party I threw for her. And the non-apology because the person who caused the injury paraded around all his own hurts as a way to claim he couldn’t be responsible for his actions. And it also brought to mind incidents where I owed an apology and fell short. The little hitches where I still feel a little guilty or ashamed because my actions were thoughtless, careless or uninformed and I never had the guts to address it properly. All these memories make the case of how important a good apology is. As Dr. Lerner says, “I believe that tendering an apology, one that is authentic and genuinely felt, helps the other person to feel validated, soothed and cared for and can restore a sense of well-being and integrity to the one who sincerely feels she or he did something wrong. Without the possibility of apology and repair, the inherently flawed experience of being human would feel impossibly tragic.”\nThis makes me think of one of the best apologies I’ve ever heard.","passages":[{"passage":"One of my friends always says “I’m sorry.” It doesn’t matter what I say, but for whatever her reasons are, she only answers with sorry. I realize that it’s probably because she just doesn’t know what to say, but I also have come to feel the frustration that comes with hearing the same response all the time. That’s when I began to think about why people say that they’re sorry, and I’ve come to realize that it’s probably one of the most over-used words. Why is it that we are at a loss for words, that we turn to an expression that is used to show sympathy or to apologize? Sorry is defined as feeling regret, sadness, and pity. The last thing that I want to feel is pity from anyone, but it still doesn’t answer the reason why sorry is so often overused. It’s a reflex that sends the wrong message. It’s not said that when we need to own up to being responsible for our actions, we rely on saying sorry to fill the gap of awkwardness when being told of news that affects someone else. Sorry finds its way into statements that don’t have anything to do with feeling remorse. One of the most concerning issues is that apologizing too much can lead to a person sounding insincere. As a strategy for being polite, sorry has become the go-to word for keeping the peace without sounding too passive-aggressive. By changing to words such as thank you, we immediately can change the tone of our message to one that is positive. Apologizing for simply existing isn’t enough. Instead, changing the words we use can make a difference in our conversations and our relationships with each other is more beneficial, and what is meant to be. Rather than staying in the habit of saying sorry, we can practice using words that give real meaning to what we are feeling and putting the unnecessary apologies away for when they are most needed. Over-apologizing has become a common way of reacting to those around us. What many may not realize is how we lessen its meaning and its value, the more that we say we’re sorry. It can also show low-esteem and that we fear confrontation. Remembering that unless we have done something that is our fault, finding words that express what the other person may need, such as encouragement, could be the better option than saying I’m sorry.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:2680b94a-483d-43fa-98fb-4a3dbf1ac6a3>"]},{"passage":"I recently found myself in a situation where I needed to apologize to someone I hurt. I was conflicted, my thoughts filled with self-justifying righteousness, “I am right, and I am hurt, too!” Yet at the same time, I was filled with regret, choking on unfinished words and self-reproach. “This isn’t turning out the way I want it to,” I said to myself. Ugh…the only way to get myself out of my self-inflected situation was to say, “I’m sorry.”\nApologizing is difficult, especially when the stakes are high and the hurt runs deep. It’s easy to let yourself off the hook, blaming the other person and minimizing your role in the situation. When you finally bring yourself to say the words, stress hormones flood the body creating fight or flight responses. Your brain screams, “Don’t do it! Run!” or “Get mad! Don’t go down without a fight!” It’s takes everything in your power to go through with it. Your mind spins as you think of the million ways to express yourself. But in the end, it’s worth it. When you apologize, it allows space for both you and the other person to move forward, to let go, to forgive. It will make you and the other person feel better. So how do you apologize the right way? Write Down the Outcomes You Want\nBefore you go into a high stress situation, know what you want to get out of it. Write down your desired outcomes and keep them handy during the conversation; it will help you stay on track if the person responds emotionally and you can review them if you find yourself getting emotional or making excuses. Examples of outcomes might be to repair a damaged relationship, defuse an emotional situation, or simply to own your part in a conflict. Check Your Emotions. Choose How You Want to Feel\nEmotions don’t have to dictate your feelings and reactions. Even when they are strong, you can still choose how you want to feel. You can choose to feel compassion, relief, or ownership. Or you can also choose to feel angry, justified, or shameful. It’s up to you to determine your outlook on the situation, so check your emotions and choose to see the bright side of apologizing. Apologize. Own it. Don’t Over Explain Your Actions\nIt’s best to just say, “I am sorry; I own what I did.” Most people don’t want to hear excuses because they water down the apology and make it feel insincere. Sometimes though, it may be appropriate to explain your side, but only do it to help the person forgive, not to minimize your role in what happened. Over explaining sounds like excuse making. Express Regret, Be Specific\nIn addition to saying, “I’m sorry,” you should express regret for hurting the other person. For example, “I regret hurting you; it was wrong of me to blame you and it damaged our relationship. Our relationship is important to me and I understand that I have to earn your trust back.” This validates the person’s feelings which is what most people want out of an apology. Being specific brings a tone of sincerity and it shows you understand how your actions affected the person. Ask Questions and Listen\nRemember, the person you are apologizing to isn’t there to only hear you out. Give him or her the opportunity to respond. Ask questions to draw out meaningful dialogue, listen carefully and don’t get defensive. Make Commitments and Keep Them\nAfter you’ve apologized and expressed regret, make a commitment to change your behavior. Outline what you are going to do differently and follow through. Everyone makes mistakes but there is nothing worse than repeating it because you didn’t change your behavior. Trust can be rebuilt quickly if you demonstrate that you’ve learned from what happened. Smile, Say Thank You and Leave\nAt the end of your apology, smile. Smiling makes everyone feel better and it releases tension. Thank the person for listening and then leave. Most people need time to process and hanging around afterwards doesn’t allow the space required to do so. Following these steps will help you deliver a sincere, meaningful apology and will start the process of forgiveness.

It can repair just about anything.”\nThanks for reading and as always, I appreciate comments, likes and shares!

They have a powerful ability to create positive interactions, so look for opportunities to use them every day. Using “please” expresses both respect and consideration for those with whom we’re interacting because it changes a command into a request. It sets the tone for whatever follows and is one of most important universal manners. “Thank You” and “You’re Welcome”\nMost people know to express their thanks for gifts, favors, awards, and the like. But we sometimes fail to recognize and show appreciation for the everyday courtesies that come our way, such as when someone holds the door or lets us go ahead in line. Expressing thanks for these little services is a hallmark of civility. When someone says, “thank you,” the best response is, “you’re welcome.” Don’t be bashful—accept the credit for your kindness. It’s subtle, but an “it was nothing” is actually saying that you place no value on what you did. By accepting thanks graciously you can also encourage the “thank-you” habit. “Excuse me,” “pardon me,” and “I beg your pardon” all express your awareness that you’ve inconvenienced someone else. Make it a habit to excuse yourself whenever you do the following:\n- Make a necessary interruption: “Excuse me, but you have a phone call.”\n- Make a request: “Excuse me, but this is the non-smoking section.”\n- Acknowledge an error: “Excuse me. I didn’t realize that you were already waiting in line.”\n- Acknowledge a faux pas, such as burping: “Excuse me.”\n- Leave a conversation: “Excuse me, I wish I could chat longer, but I have to leave now.”\n- Get up from the table: “Please excuse me.”\nMaking and accepting apologies gracefully are acts of courtesy and maturity, and they are important for matters both big and small. Sincere apologies can defuse volatile situations; it’s hard for most people to remain angry with someone who takes responsibility for his own actions. “I’m sorry” is also one of the simplest and often kindest ways to express sympathy or regret. A job loss, an illness, a death in the family, or the loss of a pet are all times when you might say sorry. At these times, keep it simple—you don’t need to elaborate if you aren’t sure what else to say.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:4212f736-c2ac-463d-bdad-c0af2f2ae6b1>"]},{"passage":"Knowing the secrets of a really good apology can mean the difference between this:\nMost of us learned to apologize back when we were in preschool and as far as I can tell, few people have upgraded their approach since then. Remember the drill? You whacked some girl with your shovel or you yanked the cat’s tail and before you had time to enjoy what you’d done some looming grown-up was pressuring you to say you were sorry. So you took a deep breath and, contrite or not, you managed to squeak out a barely audible “sorry.”\nWith that, thank goodness, the ordeal was over. An apology like this is lacking, well… just about everything that a Class-A apology needs. An apology is worth very little if it’s been extracted, rather than given. If your M.O. is to “demand” an apology, rethink your strategy. A well-executed, sincere apology feels like a gift to the receiver. Once you’ve experienced the real thing, you’ll clearly know the difference. Worse still is an apology that is an attack or a criticism in disguise. Here are some common apology blunders to eliminate from your repertoire:\n“I’m sorry that you’re so sensitive.”\n“I’m sorry if…”\n“I’m sorry that it pissed you off when I did the thing you always do.”\n“You want an apology? Fine, here’s an apology.”\nAny of these moves sound familiar? If so, I bet you aren’t winning rave reviews for your effort. Ready for an alternative? Step 1- Mean what you say\nThe key ingredient to making a truly standout apology is that you actually have to be sorry. This is essential. You may not have been sorry for stealing your sister’s cupcake when you were six. But by the time you’re, say, forty-six, if you forgot to pick your daughter up from her saxophone lesson or you didn’t close the sunroof and the car is knee-deep in rain, unless you’re a sociopath, chances are you feel sorry and you’re ready to say so. Step 2- Articulate exactly what it is that you’re sorry for\n“I’m sorry I left the cat door unlocked… I overspent at Nordstrom’s… I forgot to pick up the dry cleaning… I drank too much at your office party… I made a joke that embarrassed you.”\nI’m not suggesting that you have to wear a hair shirt or fall on your knees. I’m simply suggesting that you look yourself in the eye and be prepared to admit what you’ve done. Step 3- Self-reflect\nA slightly better-than-average apology is consists of Steps 1 and 2, but if you’re going for the gold, you’ll have to do some soul-searching about what led to your misstep in the first place. One client I worked with refused to keep a calendar, insisting he didn’t need one. Yet, time and again, he missed important meetings, especially with his partner. His new and improved apology included an admission of being both dishonest with himself about his imperfect memory and inconsiderate of the impact that his self-deception had on others. Another client who was consistently late, admitted that she felt entitled to have her lateness overlooked because she was such a kind and generous mother. This, she said sheepishly, had prevented her from making any apology at all. Step 4- Seek ways to improve your performance. Even the most heartfelt and thorough apology isn’t worth much if you turn right around and do the exact same thing again. A winning apology includes a commitment to change. Sounds difficult? Consider this. We all make mistakes, but here’s no reason for your apology to be an additional one. Why not give it a try? I’d love to hear how it goes.

It made me think about the word, SORRY. How many times a day do we\/I\/you use this word???? Sorry has all kinds of meanings:\n--Grieved for the loss of some good; pained for some evil; feeling regret; -- now generally used to express light grief or affliction, but formerly often used to express deeper feeling. --Melancholy; dismal; gloomy; mournful; (She is in a sorry mood today!) --Poor; mean; worthless; (That is a sorry excuse.). I can only speak for myself, but I know that I seem to constantly use the word.. I 'am' a pleaser --especially to my sweet husband, and whenever I think I've done (or do) something crazy or stupid, I apologize BIGTIME. \"I'm sorry that I walk so slowly.\" \"I am sorry that I complain about my aches and pains so much.\" I feel so sorry for you---having to put up with a moody female like me.\" Just think about it... I seem to apologize ALOT. Do you???? Then, there's always the problem when someone 'does' say \"I'm Sorry\" that makes one wonder if they really are sorry ---or whether they are just using words that mean nothing...???? An apology that means nothing is worse I think than no apology at all. Why is it that some people seem to apologize ALOT and others never seem to say \"I'm Sorry\"???? Maybe, saying \"I'm Sorry\" has a different meaning to some than it does to others. Maybe --some of the problem has to do with 'forgiveness' (which is another blog)! All of these thoughts made me do some research on the word, SORRY. I read on www.brainyquote.com MANY different quotes from people using the word, sorry. It's interesting how the word has so many meanings and interpretations. If you want to know who said some of these quotes listed below, click HERE. It is interesting! See if you can guess which one of these quotes was said by Monica Lewinsky.

You can work it out with them to figure out what would be acceptable. You might also make restitution to show others that you are a good person. This line of thought comes from the virtue signaling ethic, and while it is great that you are doing the right thing, this is not the best way too apologize. It could lead you to think that you can just balance your bad deeds with good deeds, but this idea fails to strengthen the bonds that you have with others. Language 3: Request Forgiveness\nWhen you request forgiveness from someone you are showing them that their opinion really matters to you, and you want to rebuild the relationship that you have with them. This follows the negotiation ethic which states that you should change your social contracts in order to benefit everyone involved in them. When you request forgiveness you recognize that your actions went against the best interest of the person you wronged, and that you should have received their permission before acting. The autonomy ethic states that you should change your values in order to bolster your identity depending on each scenario. If you request forgiveness not because you care about what the other person thinks, but to avoid retribution from them, then you are following this ethic. This request for forgiveness is not a heartfelt apology because you are only thinking of yourself. Language 4: Accept Responsibility\nThe responsibility ethic states that you should change your social contracts in order to help the people you lead. When you accept the responsibility for your actions you try to manage the consequences of your actions. This shows the people that you have wronged that you still want to help them. You don't want your actions to be a burden to them. The branding ethic states that you should change your values in order to best embody the things you represent. If you take responsibility of your actions so that you can save your image this is a great thing to do, but it isn't a great apology. It shows people that you care about yourself more than the people that you harmed. Language 5: Expressing Regret\nWhen you express regret for your behavior you are being accountable to others. This follows the fifth relationship ethic which states that you must hold other people accountable for their actions by telling them how their actions have influenced others. When you express regret you tell the person you have wronged that you realize how much your actions have hurt them, and let them know that you wish you hadn't hurt them because of how much they mean to you. The self assessment ethic is the opposing ethic it states that you should evaluate your own behavior, and determine if it is actually beneficial to you. You might feel bad because you realize that your behavior is wrong and it is hurting you. But this regret is not an apology, because you don't have anyone to express it to. If you do express regret to someone because you realize that your actions are hurting yourself you will seem insincere. They will probably be like the kid with terrible drawing skills, and claim you aren't actually sorry, just sorry that your actions caught up to you. Although there are several ways to apologize, not all of the methods are necessary every time. For instance the kid whose feelings I hurt seemed to be fine after I expressed regret, and I stopped hurting his feelings. Something that I did not talk about is the relationship between personality, and apology methods. Gary Chapman's work focusses on this topic a lot, and suggests that for some people one of the apology methods will resonate with them far better than the others. One other thing that I wanted to point out is that the different apology methods are also the steps of repentance. So repentance is making an apology to God for the sins that you committed against Him. Its purpose is to initiate the rebuilding of your relationship with God. If done properly both repentance and apologizing will lead you to become a better person, and they will allow God and others to regain their trust in you.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:16d71ef5-af12-46b7-9ec7-8a325f574615>"]},{"passage":"Recently, I've heard a slew of apologies. Paula Deen said “sorry” for her racist behavior, Anthony Weiner took responsibility (kind of) for airing his privates once again, Riley Cooper swore he’d learned from his racist mistakes, and the barista at my local coffee shop apologized profusely for not having the coffee flavor I love. It seems like everyone — celebrities and regular Joes and Janes alike — has apology fever. In fact, some psychologists and business experts note the U.S. has developed what they dub an “apology culture,” in which people of all professions, from CEOs to physicians, are apologizing more frequently. Blame lawsuit culture, a society based on shame, or whatever you will: Everybody’s doing it. But do apologies actually help reconcile hurt feelings, or can they make things worse? Is there a “right” or “wrong” way to deliver an apology? Science helps us navigate America’s newest hobby. The Right Way to Say It\nWhether it’s via an appearance on a morning news show, a dozen long-stemmed roses, or standing outside someone’s window with a boom box blaring Akon’s Put the Blame on Me, there are approximately a million ways to apologize. But, as we’ve learned from both public figures (think Mel Gibson and Anthony Weiner) and, most likely, our own personal experiences, not all apologies are equally effective. Unfortunately, experts haven't settled on one specific set of criteria for the \"perfect apology\". Some sources maintain there are four key components to an apology, while others claim as many as seven factors must be present in order for an apology to work. What each of these theories has in common is the idea that a meaningful apology should include clear acknowledgment and explanation of the offense, an expression of regret or shame, and a commitment to making reparations or providing compensation (whether monetary or symbolic). This doesn’t seem like rocket science, but, in fact, many apologies lack even these basic parts. When Serena Williams blasted a line judge about an unfair call at the 2009 U.S. Open, her apology was everything but apologetic, lacking a clear statement of regret and failing to address the line judge’s feelings. Though Paula Deen’s first apology was a tearful cry for forgiveness, by generalizing her actions as “mistakes I have made” and the “wrong that I have done,” she failed to say what she’s sorry for and acknowledge the feelings of the offended parties. Of course, we can't know whether the offended parties appreciated the apologies regardless. But what these examples highlight is the fact that it's easy to overlook some of the core factors in what research dubs the most meaningful \"sorry\". An apology doesn’t have to be an elaborate song and dance, but the most effective ones take more than just slapping together a few slick words and shedding some tears. Better Safe and Sorry\nEven if saying “sorry” is a little tough, owning up to mistakes yields some pretty great perks. Research has found that apologies promote reconciliation between the two quarreling parties and can restore trust when the offender takes responsibility for their actions Removing the shadow of suspicion: the effects of apology versus denial for repairing competence-versus integrity-based trust violations.

So, when it happens, how can we best deal with it in order to repair the situation? When to apologise (and when not to)\nFor some, “sorry” is the hardest word to say, while for others, the word spills from their lips with such frequency it appears to be their default response to anything that happens. If you’re in the latter category, I recommend you give some thought to why this is. What are you apologising for? Are you actually responsible for whatever has gone wrong? I’m thinking here of the times I’ve apologised for stuff that nobody could logically consider my fault, such as when my cousin came to visit me and it rained. Because as I was growing up I felt myself blamed for all sorts of things that were far outside my control, I continue to feel the impulse to seek forgiveness for practically any negative event that takes place around me. It’s an impulse I need to resist, for several reasons. An endless stream of apologies can be irritating, prompting the people on the receiving end to react in one of two ways: either they will feel obliged to keep reassuring the apologiser, when they might more usefully be concentrating on sorting out the problem, or they may buy into the grovelling and start berating the apologiser for whatever has transpired, whether or not it was her fault. Constant apologising can backfire and, in any case, the guilt and shame that accompany it are corrosive. However, this is not to say you should never apologise unless you have personally and deliberately done someone down. Not taking responsibility when the buck stops with you is even worse than assuming responsibility for events outside your control. It is the antithesis of leadership, integrity and courage – and it rarely fools anybody anyway. If I go into a busy restaurant, for example, where I have booked a table and the waiter says he has no record of my booking and there is no table available, I will feel far more mollified if he apologises and offers to make amends, rather than blaming the mistake on junior staff and shrugging it off. In some circumstances, it can take a lot of strength and confidence to apologise for an unintended consequence of something you’ve done, but in my experience it can be a healing and immensely helpful thing to do. What I have in mind here is the times my partner inadvertently upsets me. In some areas, I’m extremely sensitive and easily distressed and, when everything is fine, I accept I have to take responsibility for this and not force those around me to walk on eggshells. Once the wrong button has been pushed, though, I find it very hard not to react in childish ways, either crying and screaming in rage or withdrawing and hiding in fear. With most people, this behaviour tends simply to escalate the situation, as they feel threatened and defend themselves either by whinging (this is how it feels to me at the time) about how this isn’t their fault and I’m being unfair, or by attacking me back. I thank God that my man has the wisdom and strength to respond to me as the child I become in that state. He tells me calmly, gently and sincerely that he’s sorry for whatever it was he said or did that upset me. He puts his arms around me and we talk about it till it’s all over. He learns from each incident and never makes the same mistake twice, and gradually I’m learning too that I can trust him and need to deal with these things in a more grown-up way. How to apologise\nThe thing to remember when you’re apologising is that it’s for the other person’s benefit, not yours. If the purpose of your saying sorry is purely to elicit absolution from the wronged party, spare a thought in advance for how you may feel if absolution is not forthcoming. If your transgression has been serious, you may need to give the other person some time and space to process what has happened before you can expect a move towards forgiveness – but just because you don’t receive it immediately it doesn’t mean you will never get it. A meaningful apology, one that can repair the damage, obviously has to come from the heart.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:c095249a-c404-4d6e-b287-a37fdc17568f>"]},{"passage":"By Dianna Booher\nWhy won’t the latest celebrity flap go away? Situations calling for a public apology come and go about once a month. Some rock star, movie actor, athlete, or politician gets caught shoplifting, driving while drunk, doing drugs, having an affair, uttering prejudicial slurs over an open mic, or taking a bribe, and the public becomes outraged about the duplicity. The public persona and principles preached don’t match the private behavior. What further enrages us about such situations is that typically the celebrity involved first takes the stance: “It’s none of your business.” When that line doesn’t work, he or she tries to make excuses, “I was drunk\/stoned\/conned\/didn’t know that blah, blah, blah . . .”—fill in the blanks. When those excuses don’t calm the waters, the person finally comes out with a belated apology. Life goes back to normal. We once again buy the person's music, or see his movies, or go to his ball games, or elect him or her to office. There’s only one exception to this rule: If the celebrity tries to offer a pseudoapology, one with no real admission of wrongdoing. (For familiar examples, see below.) When that’s the case, the media and public chew on the story until the celebrity spits out an admission of guilt. Only then does life resume for the wronged and the harangued. Ditto at the office. People have difficulty offering an outright apology—an expression of “I’m concerned because I made a mistake\/I did something wrong.” And they get the same kind of reaction as celebrities do to their pseudoapologies. What makes a good apology? 1. Admission of error, guilt, or wrongdoing. The person accepts responsibility for what was said or done and its inappropriateness, inaccuracy, weakness, hurtfulness, insensitivity, or whatever. 2. Specificity. Apologizing specifically sounds sincere. Global, blanket apologies convey lack of concern or understanding of the situation or damage caused. 3. Amends. Apologizing typically involves some attempt to make things right, some words or gesture of goodwill toward the offended person or group. Children learn these steps before they learn to count. But medical schools and hospitals are increasingly adding “How to Apologize” to their curriculum for grown-ups to learn as ways to head off malpractice lawsuits. According to a story by the Associated Press, the hospitals in the University of Michigan Health System have been encouraging doctors to apologize for mistakes. As a result, the system’s annual attorney fees, malpractice lawsuits, and notices of intent to sue have fallen dramatically. An admission of wrongdoing isn’t always appropriate, of course. But you can express regret over a situation, results, or an outcome no matter who or what caused it. Failure to admit mistakes leads to outrage. Failure to express concern leads to bitterness. Survivors, even dying victims, forgive mistakes; they don’t forgive unconcern. Concern connects people. In whatever situation—from product recall to layoffs to employee illness to accident victims to stressed colleagues—there’s tremendous power in communicating your concern. When logic causes a lapse in the relationship, emotion closes the gap. Psuedoapologies That Alienate\nApology, Plus Denial\n“No, I didn’t e-mail the meeting agenda to everyone ahead of time.

Apology, Plus Good Intentions\n“I’ve been putting out fires all morning ever since I came in at 6:30, but I won’t bore you with the details.

As I was lifting it out of the storage space, he reached for it and his littlest pinky finger got pinched in the hinge that connects the sides of the ladder as it opens. Yikes! I put the step ladder down, scooped him up and said, “I’m so sorry.”\nI wanted to say, “But you need to wait til I get it all the way out.” And “That’s why these things are grown-up things.” And probably 15 other things in order to make myself feel better because I very much didn’t like being responsible for an action that pinched his finger. But I didn’t ,because I remember listening to a podcast with psychologist Harriet Lerner on Brené Brown’s Unlocking Us series that was like a master class on apologies. It was 2 years ago and so well done that I still remember some talking points. One being “When ‘but’ is tagged on to an apology, it undoes the sincerity.” If there is a genuine counter point or excuse to the apology, it needs to happen as a separate conversation. So I looked up some more details from Dr. Lerner’s book, Why Won’t You Apologize: Healing Big Betrayals and Every Day Hurts. She notes there are cultural differences when it comes to apologies. There are also gender differences – males are more likely to be non-apologizers, women are more likely to be over-apologizers. But for anyone trying to craft a sincere apology, here are some pointers she provides of things not to do:\n- Saying I’m sorry you feel that way: These are apologies that don’t address what happened but instead try to target the emotions of the other party. - The “IF” apology: I’m sorry IF you thought is a weaselly effort to not own what happened. - The mystifying apology: What is it that the apologizer just said? Apologies that usually are too wordy and talk around the issue, leave the other party feeling confused. - The apology as instant expectation of forgiveness: I apologize now you must forgive me is a quid pro quo that undermines the apology as a genuine offering and not just a means to an end. - Not listening: If we don’t hear the injured party out, they will not feel heard and any apology will fall short of the entire wound. So what is a good apology? A simple statement expressing remorse for the action we are apologizing for, owning what we did, not taking more that our share of blame (because that comes across as insincere) and not trying to speak to how the other person feels. Just thumbing this book reminded me of some old wounds that I was surprised to find hadn’t fully healed over because I can still think of the poor apologies I’ve received. The down-played sorry – “I’m sorry that I called you a ‘brat’ when I was feeling crappy” when that wasn’t the word used at all. The blame-shifting excuse: “I was feeling sick, what was I to do?” when someone no-showed\/no-called to the birthday party I threw for her. And the non-apology because the person who caused the injury paraded around all his own hurts as a way to claim he couldn’t be responsible for his actions. And it also brought to mind incidents where I owed an apology and fell short. The little hitches where I still feel a little guilty or ashamed because my actions were thoughtless, careless or uninformed and I never had the guts to address it properly. All these memories make the case of how important a good apology is. As Dr. Lerner says, “I believe that tendering an apology, one that is authentic and genuinely felt, helps the other person to feel validated, soothed and cared for and can restore a sense of well-being and integrity to the one who sincerely feels she or he did something wrong. Without the possibility of apology and repair, the inherently flawed experience of being human would feel impossibly tragic.”\nThis makes me think of one of the best apologies I’ve ever heard.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:1c12c398-1afb-47a6-b348-ff0ac350b841>"]}]}

The beauty of it all is no one really knows! The old man selling cups of local brew on the street corner will tell you it all began when Don Juan, a Spanish villain and notorious womanizer, was pelted with tomatoes in response to his dreadful singing voice and appalling guitar ability. The little kids trying to make some extra pocket money by looking after your backpack for the night, will swear it was started by a group local rascals raiding a fruit-stand in the town centre and hurling them at each other in a fleeting, moment of madness. And the local women eagerly selling their souvenir T-shirts will say that over 50 years ago a parade, honouring the town’s patron saint Luis Bertràn, ended in carnage when a local produce cart was crushed spilling thousands of ripe tomatoes onto the streets. In true Spanish-fiesta spirit they were promptly picked up and launched at anyone in sight. Whatever legend of La Tomatina you may hear, or choose to believe, nothing comes close to those few breathtaking hours when over 20,000 people ram the streets armed with 250,000 pounds of glorious tomatoes. Forget the term food fight, this is an all-in war! THE FESTIVALOnce a year the sleepy mountain village of Buñol comes alive with thousands of people and truckloads of tomatoes for one of the most amazing spectacles you will ever see! The morning action gets underway when a ham is placed on top of a tall, greased pole in front of the local town hall. The Tomato chaos can only get underway once someone is able to climb the slippery pole and grab the ham. It's hilarious as heaps of people try to scale this pole, climbing over each other, in order to be the illustrious one to claim the ham. Once the ham is snatched the chanting rises to a fever pitch as the trucks roll in and dump masses upon masses of ripe & ready tomatoes in the centre of town, Plaza del Pueblo, and the surrounding streets. The signal for the beginning of the throwing is the firing of five bulbous (tomato-packed rockets) out of a canon and into the air. The crowd erupts into a deafening roar and this launches everyone into a flinging and slinging frenzy. Lock and load because it's on!

BOLAS DE FUEGO\nBack in 1922 the local volcano in Nejapa, El Salvador, erupted. It sent the locals scurrying to safety. Their assumption at the time was that their beloved Saint Jeronimo was fighting the devil. In remembrance of this event, the local youths re-enact the volcanic activity by hurling lit gasoline-soaked balls of cloth at each other. They do have gloves and also carry wet clothes for a modicum of protection, but it’s not unknown for their clothing to catch fire. Hundreds of spectators line up to view the display, and despite the obviously hazardous aspects of the Bolas de Fuego Festival, there are relatively few serious injuries. Perhaps they are under the auspices of San Jeronimo. The last Wednesday of August in Buñol, Spain is reserved for one of the biggest, messiest and yuckiest food fights in the world. Tons of tomatoes are shipped into the little town in large trucks, and as soon as the signal has been given, a free-for-all tomato fight begins. Although the tradition of La Tomatina is a relatively recent one, no one is exactly sure of its origin. It started in 1944. After a few rocky years initially, it was finally designated a bone fide event amongst Spanish festivals in 1975. There’s absolutely no significance to this tomato fight, just an opportunity for some good, messy fun. The actual battle lasts only an hour. It is triggered when a ham placed on top of a greasy pole is retrieved and then participants are showered with and throw tomatoes at each other. The fruit must be squashed before hurling, to help prevent injuries. At the end, people flock to the portable showers, and within a relatively short period, street cleaners leave the streets pristine, and all signs of La Tomatina have completely vanished. Learn more about these and other celebrations happening around the world this week on World Music with Deirdre Saravia, Saturday nights at 8:00 on KSTX 89.1 FM.\n\n5 Festivals That Unite The Weirdest People Together\nThere hardly is a location that never hosts festivals or holds fairs or concerts. People all over the world give away hundreds of dollars to go for another bright event. Music festivals, food and drink fests – all of them find millions of fan that count days for another show. However, there are certain events that have no real reason for being incredibly popular. They seem more weird than exciting. Today we are going to share with you our list of the craziest festivals that unite the oddest people of our planet. Are you ready? The fest unites 2 types of people: those who have the strongest desire to become a mermaid (men and women); those who have a deep love to mermaids and want a photo with at least one of them (even if the tail is made of silicone). To join the group of Merfest’s mermaids, one has to spend some cash for a tail, which cost $80 for one made of fabric and between $2700 and $4000 for a custom-fitted fluke made of silicone. Merfest takes place in North Carolina, the USA at the beginning of January. That won’t be surprised that it is held in swimming pool. 2. Night of the Radishes\nAn annual event of Oaxaca, Mexico. The city has been known for its woodcarving masters. The event has its origins in the colonial period when radishes were introduced by the Spanish. Both these facts became the basis for what is now called ‘Night of the Radishes’. For a whole year, people here struggle to grow huge radishes. The biggest ones they use for carving and exposing their artworks to compete for prizes at the Night of the Radishes. The event is held annually 2 days before Christmas. 3. La Tomatina\nThe Spanish know how to have fun. Imagine 40,000 people using 100 tonnes of fresh tomatoes for the biggest fight of their lives. Sounds weird? Welcome to La Tomatina – the most shocking festival of the August. To join the tomato battle, feel free to come to Buñol, Spain on the last Wednesday in August. Once you hear the water guns – time to start the battle. You have 1 hour sharp to kick asses of those guys you don’t like. After the battle is over – the locals will use irrigation hoses to wash away all tomato remains from your body. 4. Tuna Tossing\nNo wonder this event came to existence in Australia. What other nation could throw away huge tuna fish just for fun? The rules are simple – register for a contest, grab a whole-frozen tuna and throw it away as far as you can. That tuna that lands further than the others will bring the athlete absolute victory and a nice prize. You can try your luck next January in Port Lincoln. 5. Up Helly Aa\nEvery last Tuesday of January a thousand guizers in Lerwick and considerably lower numbers in the more rural festivals, formed into squads who march through the town or village in a variety of themed costumes. The day involves a series of marches and visitations, culminating in a torch-lit procession and the burning of a galley. Don’t know if this is a coincidence, that most of the oddest events are held in January, but at least I know how to start the upcoming year.\n\nPittston Tomato Festival Tomato Fight 2009 in Slow Motion MP3\nhttp:\/\/www.pittstontomatofe...

If you know that a random attack is waiting around the corner, you will learn to think twice before submitting a provocation of any kind.As an observer and resident of Spain you can only hope that what happened today will mark history, not as an unreliable incident, but as a real start of a new era. At least two factors made this day possible. What happened in the world around Spain and -- to a lesser extent -- recent politics. The first one is most important. What happened in Ireland is part of the first factor. But both events depend on what happened on September 11; the entrance of a new enemy often makes old enemies collaborate. Internal politics was also a factor but less important. This is only an opinion but the peaceful approach of the presidential party (PSOE) certainly helped. There are too many counter examples were pull devil pull baker doesn't always temper a conflict.Politics, both in business as societal, can be very stubborn. Rather than harvesting a historical event politicians devote to more rivalry. In this case it is quite a challenge for both political parties to cooperate (only for this one as I'm concerned) and to get this \"issue\" out for ever.Hans Bool..Hans Bool is the founder of Astor White a traditional management consulting company that offers online management advice.

And in Spain, the festival holds special importance in many parts of Andalucia, but especially Córdoba, which has the most famous celebration. Dates from Dates Apr 27, 2012 to May 1, 2012. HISTORY OF THE FESTIVAL\nThe May Crosses Festival celebrated in Andalucia is probably one of the most interesting festivals, not only today, but in historical terms. As legend has it, St Constantine’s mother, the much-venerated St Helen, is the founder of this festival, which shows special respect for the cross upon which Jesus was crucified. As the story goes, in the fourth century AD, St Helen went to Jerusalem in search of the cross, after her son Constantine dreamed of a cross that would help him win a battle he was losing at the time. He ordered his troops to build him a large cross, which they then carried into battle and conquered their enemy. This inspired a family conversion to Christianity and a search for the real cross, led by St Helen. She found three crosses, and to establish which one was authentic, she carried out tests to see which could perform miracles. Only one of them did, healing the sick and even bringing the dead back to life. St Helen then became a champion for the cross, urging people to continue worshipping even after her death. And so this veneration of the cross is the motive for the May Crosses Festivals that are celebrated in so many countries.

Many people believe it was the Greeks, but it was not. In this post, we tell you who started this work called harvest, the harvesting of the fruit of the vine, which has remained almost intact to this day. The development of viticulture\nIt was originated by the Egyptians, who developed this practice for the first time with a certain degree of technique, despite the years that separate us. The process was very similar to what we know today: the bunches of grapes were harvested from the vines and placed in baskets that were transported to a press. This process was carried out by the grape harvesters. Wine, at that time, was considered a divine drink that was enjoyed only by the nobility and royalty. It was common to mix it with honey and other aromas that softened its character. Wine acquired a social and relevant character in Greek and Roman society under the protection of the god of wine, Dionysus for the Greeks, Bacchus for the Romans. In honor of this god, innumerable festivities were celebrated, such as the famous bacchanals. The grape harvest in Spain\nThe arrival of Christianity in the Middle Ages had a great influence on the world of wine. The crops were located around the monasteries and their production was destined for the liturgy and food. In the case of the Cistercian monks, the daily consumption of a glass of wine was part of their diet, and the common people included it in their usual diet. From its origins to the present, the technological advances that occurred at the beginning of the 19th century have been transcendental for the evolution of the grape harvest. We must take the history of La Rioja to contextualize the period of expansion in Spain, with the arrival of Basque and later Jerez capital to invest in new wineries in what was then the only prestigious wine area in the country. This capital, in many cases financial, was invested in winemaking with the introduction of stainless steel and other technologies, in a Spain that was beginning to enjoy wine as a consumer product beyond as part of the diet that winegrowers and other agricultural workers needed for daily work. For years, the harvesters were the ones who picked the grapes and selected in the winery which ones were suitable for producing the wine. The ‘industrialization’ of the sector, first in the 19th century with the arrival of French capital in La Rioja to guarantee the supply of grapes after phylloxera devastated the Bordeaux vineyards, and then in the 20th century with the investment of financial and industrial capital, they raised the wineries to the consideration of companies. Harvesting began to share space with technology when the traditional goblet vineyards gave way to trellis plantations in search of better yields. In this sense, the trellis meant that the plant was trained in a more open way to achieve greater exposure to the sun and better aeration, thus reducing the risk of fungal diseases. In this way, a higher population density and a better use of space was achieved, as well as more uniform clusters both in size and ripening. This system also facilitated certain mechanical works, including harvesting by machine. The grape harvest at Familia Martínez Bujanda\nFounded in 1889, the first Familia Martínez Bujanda winery has become a unique space, a museum, an authentic place of wine worship. Located in the upper part of the town of Oyón, it allows visitors to appreciate the winemaking and ageing techniques that were used more than 100 years ago in La Rioja. The winery is distributed on three different levels, to take advantage of gravity in the winemaking process. How was the wine made? The grapes were received by means of “comportones”, which were deposited in open lakes. The grapes were then lightly crushed, and the wines left to ferment for 8-10 days. Once fermented, the wine was separated from the paste to make four fractions of different qualities, which could then be blended or not. The first fraction was the ‘tear wine’, the one that came out by gravity. The second was the standing wine, which came out by stepping on the pasta. The third, the “remango”, which consisted of treading half a lake on top of the other. The fourth, finally, came from the press. The fusion of tradition and technology.\n\nPopular conception of question time in the Spanish Inquisition \/ newsbiscuit.com\nThis was a Catholic tribunal founded on a temporary basis in France and Germany. Its purpose was to seek out heresy, prosecute and punish it. In the thirteenth and later centuries how you decided to worship God in Europe was not optional. Heretics were severely punished, often capitally, by burning alive. The latter is probably the most painful way to die, but the Church believed that only by burning could the non-conformist devil in a person be driven out and destroyed. The country of Spain, and later its empire, is chiefly associated by historical novelists with the Inquisition, also known as the ‘Holy Office’ or Santo Oficio. A medieval inquisition was set up in the kingdom of Aragon, with headquarters in Tarragona, but this was superceded in the late fifteenth century by the newly invented Castilian or Spanish Inquisition, founded by a papal bull by Sixtus VI in 1478. The branch was devoted first and foremost to investigating how converted Jews and Muslims were behaving now that they were Christian. The Spanish Jews and Muslims of Castilla had been forced to embrace Christianity in the stern form of Catholic Faith in 1492 and 1502 respectively.

The first long trip was to Chios in the eastern Mediterranean, but he also sailed to London. It is not certain if he was simply a member of the crew, or the captain of the ship, but in February, 1477, if we are to believe his own word, he went to Iceland. Most historians do not give this tale much credence, and think he got as far as the Faroes, and why not? In winter the Faroes are as cold as Iceland anyway. What isimportant is that Columbus met and talked with descendants of the Vikings who had settled in Greenland in the 9th and 10th centuries, as well as the eastern coast of North America – and had tales to tell.Continue reading →\nThe Crusades had not achieved very much, had cost a great deal in money and lives, but had at least one merit: they introduced the idea of travel abroad; the fine feeling of leaving your own shores or borders and visiting other countries. Even so, few were the brave souls who ventured from Britain or France, say, to exotic places of renown like Venice or Copenhagen. In the 13th century A.D. two brothers called Polo, who actually came from Venice, had the courage and the resources to wander across the huge Mongol desert, and climb high mountains; at last they found themselves in the Court of the Great Khan at Cathay (which they had thought of as a myth). They even met the Emperor of China without having their hats nailed to their heads. This great adventure was written up by one of their sons, Marco, and it covered a period of around twenty years. Young Marco wrote about a mysterious group of islands on the edge of the world called (by him) Zipangu. We would call this breathlessly beautiful place Japan. But even then, though people wished to Go East, where there are spices and jewels and gold, few made the effort because world travel was dangerous. So they stayed at home, where life was only moderately so.Continue reading →\nRebellion, protest and actual war were made against Spain from 1568 to 1648, in seventeen of the provinces in the Low Countries (now Holland and Belgium). The so-called Council of Blood actually started in 1567, and was a component part of the troubles. The Spanish Hapsburgs ruled these provinces as part of the great Spanish Empire. They had originally been under the influence, if not the mandate, of Burgundy but were at last united by Charles V (Carlos Quinto) who was king of Spain as well as Holy Roman Emperor (q.v.). His son, King Philip II (Felipe Segundo) governed the region through his own appointees the regents, emphasising points of taxation and above all religion.","passages":[{"passage":"HISTORYThere are plenty of theories on how the legend of La Tomatina came about. The beauty of it all is no one really knows! The old man selling cups of local brew on the street corner will tell you it all began when Don Juan, a Spanish villain and notorious womanizer, was pelted with tomatoes in response to his dreadful singing voice and appalling guitar ability. The little kids trying to make some extra pocket money by looking after your backpack for the night, will swear it was started by a group local rascals raiding a fruit-stand in the town centre and hurling them at each other in a fleeting, moment of madness. And the local women eagerly selling their souvenir T-shirts will say that over 50 years ago a parade, honouring the town’s patron saint Luis Bertràn, ended in carnage when a local produce cart was crushed spilling thousands of ripe tomatoes onto the streets. In true Spanish-fiesta spirit they were promptly picked up and launched at anyone in sight. Whatever legend of La Tomatina you may hear, or choose to believe, nothing comes close to those few breathtaking hours when over 20,000 people ram the streets armed with 250,000 pounds of glorious tomatoes. Forget the term food fight, this is an all-in war! THE FESTIVALOnce a year the sleepy mountain village of Buñol comes alive with thousands of people and truckloads of tomatoes for one of the most amazing spectacles you will ever see! The morning action gets underway when a ham is placed on top of a tall, greased pole in front of the local town hall. The Tomato chaos can only get underway once someone is able to climb the slippery pole and grab the ham. It's hilarious as heaps of people try to scale this pole, climbing over each other, in order to be the illustrious one to claim the ham. Once the ham is snatched the chanting rises to a fever pitch as the trucks roll in and dump masses upon masses of ripe & ready tomatoes in the centre of town, Plaza del Pueblo, and the surrounding streets. The signal for the beginning of the throwing is the firing of five bulbous (tomato-packed rockets) out of a canon and into the air. The crowd erupts into a deafening roar and this launches everyone into a flinging and slinging frenzy. Lock and load because it's on! Forget that Sangria headache from the night before, you are now in the world's largest food fight! This is a salsa riot, this is insane!

BOLAS DE FUEGO\nBack in 1922 the local volcano in Nejapa, El Salvador, erupted. It sent the locals scurrying to safety. Their assumption at the time was that their beloved Saint Jeronimo was fighting the devil. In remembrance of this event, the local youths re-enact the volcanic activity by hurling lit gasoline-soaked balls of cloth at each other. They do have gloves and also carry wet clothes for a modicum of protection, but it’s not unknown for their clothing to catch fire. Hundreds of spectators line up to view the display, and despite the obviously hazardous aspects of the Bolas de Fuego Festival, there are relatively few serious injuries. Perhaps they are under the auspices of San Jeronimo. The last Wednesday of August in Buñol, Spain is reserved for one of the biggest, messiest and yuckiest food fights in the world. Tons of tomatoes are shipped into the little town in large trucks, and as soon as the signal has been given, a free-for-all tomato fight begins. Although the tradition of La Tomatina is a relatively recent one, no one is exactly sure of its origin. It started in 1944. After a few rocky years initially, it was finally designated a bone fide event amongst Spanish festivals in 1975. There’s absolutely no significance to this tomato fight, just an opportunity for some good, messy fun. The actual battle lasts only an hour. It is triggered when a ham placed on top of a greasy pole is retrieved and then participants are showered with and throw tomatoes at each other. The fruit must be squashed before hurling, to help prevent injuries. At the end, people flock to the portable showers, and within a relatively short period, street cleaners leave the streets pristine, and all signs of La Tomatina have completely vanished.

People all over the world give away hundreds of dollars to go for another bright event. Music festivals, food and drink fests – all of them find millions of fan that count days for another show. However, there are certain events that have no real reason for being incredibly popular. They seem more weird than exciting. Today we are going to share with you our list of the craziest festivals that unite the oddest people of our planet. Are you ready? The fest unites 2 types of people: those who have the strongest desire to become a mermaid (men and women); those who have a deep love to mermaids and want a photo with at least one of them (even if the tail is made of silicone). To join the group of Merfest’s mermaids, one has to spend some cash for a tail, which cost $80 for one made of fabric and between $2700 and $4000 for a custom-fitted fluke made of silicone. Merfest takes place in North Carolina, the USA at the beginning of January. That won’t be surprised that it is held in swimming pool. 2. Night of the Radishes\nAn annual event of Oaxaca, Mexico. The city has been known for its woodcarving masters. The event has its origins in the colonial period when radishes were introduced by the Spanish. Both these facts became the basis for what is now called ‘Night of the Radishes’. For a whole year, people here struggle to grow huge radishes. The biggest ones they use for carving and exposing their artworks to compete for prizes at the Night of the Radishes. The event is held annually 2 days before Christmas. 3. La Tomatina\nThe Spanish know how to have fun. Imagine 40,000 people using 100 tonnes of fresh tomatoes for the biggest fight of their lives. Sounds weird? Welcome to La Tomatina – the most shocking festival of the August. To join the tomato battle, feel free to come to Buñol, Spain on the last Wednesday in August. Once you hear the water guns – time to start the battle. You have 1 hour sharp to kick asses of those guys you don’t like. After the battle is over – the locals will use irrigation hoses to wash away all tomato remains from your body. 4. Tuna Tossing\nNo wonder this event came to existence in Australia. What other nation could throw away huge tuna fish just for fun? The rules are simple – register for a contest, grab a whole-frozen tuna and throw it away as far as you can. That tuna that lands further than the others will bring the athlete absolute victory and a nice prize. You can try your luck next January in Port Lincoln. 5. Up Helly Aa\nEvery last Tuesday of January a thousand guizers in Lerwick and considerably lower numbers in the more rural festivals, formed into squads who march through the town or village in a variety of themed costumes. The day involves a series of marches and visitations, culminating in a torch-lit procession and the burning of a galley. Don’t know if this is a coincidence, that most of the oddest events are held in January, but at least I know how to start the upcoming year.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:adb3e395-fae5-4ed0-8401-599c9dcea8bb>"]},{"passage":"Pittston Tomato Festival Tomato Fight 2009 in Slow Motion MP3\nhttp:\/\/www.pittstontomatofe...

And in Spain, the festival holds special importance in many parts of Andalucia, but especially Córdoba, which has the most famous celebration. Dates from Dates Apr 27, 2012 to May 1, 2012. HISTORY OF THE FESTIVAL\nThe May Crosses Festival celebrated in Andalucia is probably one of the most interesting festivals, not only today, but in historical terms. As legend has it, St Constantine’s mother, the much-venerated St Helen, is the founder of this festival, which shows special respect for the cross upon which Jesus was crucified. As the story goes, in the fourth century AD, St Helen went to Jerusalem in search of the cross, after her son Constantine dreamed of a cross that would help him win a battle he was losing at the time. He ordered his troops to build him a large cross, which they then carried into battle and conquered their enemy. This inspired a family conversion to Christianity and a search for the real cross, led by St Helen. She found three crosses, and to establish which one was authentic, she carried out tests to see which could perform miracles. Only one of them did, healing the sick and even bringing the dead back to life. St Helen then became a champion for the cross, urging people to continue worshipping even after her death. And so this veneration of the cross is the motive for the May Crosses Festivals that are celebrated in so many countries.

Many people believe it was the Greeks, but it was not. In this post, we tell you who started this work called harvest, the harvesting of the fruit of the vine, which has remained almost intact to this day. The development of viticulture\nIt was originated by the Egyptians, who developed this practice for the first time with a certain degree of technique, despite the years that separate us. The process was very similar to what we know today: the bunches of grapes were harvested from the vines and placed in baskets that were transported to a press. This process was carried out by the grape harvesters. Wine, at that time, was considered a divine drink that was enjoyed only by the nobility and royalty. It was common to mix it with honey and other aromas that softened its character. Wine acquired a social and relevant character in Greek and Roman society under the protection of the god of wine, Dionysus for the Greeks, Bacchus for the Romans. In honor of this god, innumerable festivities were celebrated, such as the famous bacchanals. The grape harvest in Spain\nThe arrival of Christianity in the Middle Ages had a great influence on the world of wine. The crops were located around the monasteries and their production was destined for the liturgy and food. In the case of the Cistercian monks, the daily consumption of a glass of wine was part of their diet, and the common people included it in their usual diet. From its origins to the present, the technological advances that occurred at the beginning of the 19th century have been transcendental for the evolution of the grape harvest. We must take the history of La Rioja to contextualize the period of expansion in Spain, with the arrival of Basque and later Jerez capital to invest in new wineries in what was then the only prestigious wine area in the country. This capital, in many cases financial, was invested in winemaking with the introduction of stainless steel and other technologies, in a Spain that was beginning to enjoy wine as a consumer product beyond as part of the diet that winegrowers and other agricultural workers needed for daily work. For years, the harvesters were the ones who picked the grapes and selected in the winery which ones were suitable for producing the wine. The ‘industrialization’ of the sector, first in the 19th century with the arrival of French capital in La Rioja to guarantee the supply of grapes after phylloxera devastated the Bordeaux vineyards, and then in the 20th century with the investment of financial and industrial capital, they raised the wineries to the consideration of companies. Harvesting began to share space with technology when the traditional goblet vineyards gave way to trellis plantations in search of better yields. In this sense, the trellis meant that the plant was trained in a more open way to achieve greater exposure to the sun and better aeration, thus reducing the risk of fungal diseases. In this way, a higher population density and a better use of space was achieved, as well as more uniform clusters both in size and ripening. This system also facilitated certain mechanical works, including harvesting by machine. The grape harvest at Familia Martínez Bujanda\nFounded in 1889, the first Familia Martínez Bujanda winery has become a unique space, a museum, an authentic place of wine worship. Located in the upper part of the town of Oyón, it allows visitors to appreciate the winemaking and ageing techniques that were used more than 100 years ago in La Rioja. The winery is distributed on three different levels, to take advantage of gravity in the winemaking process. How was the wine made? The grapes were received by means of “comportones”, which were deposited in open lakes. The grapes were then lightly crushed, and the wines left to ferment for 8-10 days. Once fermented, the wine was separated from the paste to make four fractions of different qualities, which could then be blended or not. The first fraction was the ‘tear wine’, the one that came out by gravity. The second was the standing wine, which came out by stepping on the pasta. The third, the “remango”, which consisted of treading half a lake on top of the other. The fourth, finally, came from the press. The fusion of tradition and technology.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:3be9c52c-ca96-471a-8709-1b71a315830b>"]},{"passage":"Popular conception of question time in the Spanish Inquisition \/ newsbiscuit.com\nThis was a Catholic tribunal founded on a temporary basis in France and Germany. Its purpose was to seek out heresy, prosecute and punish it. In the thirteenth and later centuries how you decided to worship God in Europe was not optional. Heretics were severely punished, often capitally, by burning alive. The latter is probably the most painful way to die, but the Church believed that only by burning could the non-conformist devil in a person be driven out and destroyed. The country of Spain, and later its empire, is chiefly associated by historical novelists with the Inquisition, also known as the ‘Holy Office’ or Santo Oficio. A medieval inquisition was set up in the kingdom of Aragon, with headquarters in Tarragona, but this was superceded in the late fifteenth century by the newly invented Castilian or Spanish Inquisition, founded by a papal bull by Sixtus VI in 1478. The branch was devoted first and foremost to investigating how converted Jews and Muslims were behaving now that they were Christian. The Spanish Jews and Muslims of Castilla had been forced to embrace Christianity in the stern form of Catholic Faith in 1492 and 1502 respectively.

The first long trip was to Chios in the eastern Mediterranean, but he also sailed to London. It is not certain if he was simply a member of the crew, or the captain of the ship, but in February, 1477, if we are to believe his own word, he went to Iceland. Most historians do not give this tale much credence, and think he got as far as the Faroes, and why not? In winter the Faroes are as cold as Iceland anyway. What isimportant is that Columbus met and talked with descendants of the Vikings who had settled in Greenland in the 9th and 10th centuries, as well as the eastern coast of North America – and had tales to tell.Continue reading →\nThe Crusades had not achieved very much, had cost a great deal in money and lives, but had at least one merit: they introduced the idea of travel abroad; the fine feeling of leaving your own shores or borders and visiting other countries. Even so, few were the brave souls who ventured from Britain or France, say, to exotic places of renown like Venice or Copenhagen. In the 13th century A.D. two brothers called Polo, who actually came from Venice, had the courage and the resources to wander across the huge Mongol desert, and climb high mountains; at last they found themselves in the Court of the Great Khan at Cathay (which they had thought of as a myth). They even met the Emperor of China without having their hats nailed to their heads. This great adventure was written up by one of their sons, Marco, and it covered a period of around twenty years. Young Marco wrote about a mysterious group of islands on the edge of the world called (by him) Zipangu. We would call this breathlessly beautiful place Japan. But even then, though people wished to Go East, where there are spices and jewels and gold, few made the effort because world travel was dangerous. So they stayed at home, where life was only moderately so.Continue reading →\nRebellion, protest and actual war were made against Spain from 1568 to 1648, in seventeen of the provinces in the Low Countries (now Holland and Belgium).

Both groups said that they became interested in STEM early, usually by Grade 6. Those who persisted in STEM were more likely than those who did not to say that they had always been interested in STEM.

They developed a quantitative instrument based on psychological literature on exploration and play in order to describe and quantify young children's increasing levels of exploration of their environment. They then tested the measurement tool with parents and their preschool-aged children to investigate what types of adult coaching would achieve high-level exploratory behavior at various exhibits.

As we talked about last month, the Internet is chock-full of sites claiming that their activities will turn your young people into scientists and engineers. We know however that all STEM activities are not created equal and it can be challenging to find the right fit for your club or program. Execution, or how you facilitate the STEM activities, is also really important. We will talk about that in future posts! Look for activities that focus on real world things that your young people will be interested in and will spark their curiosity. It is also helpful if the activity has multiple creative solutions and not just one right answer. Here on campus we run a program called Teen Science Café where high school students work with one of our Rutgers scientists or engineers to learn about current research on a STEM topic of their interest. The teens invited an engineer, Dr. Benaroya, to explore the idea of moving to another planet? Dr. Benaroya completely engaged the teens in engineering and design thinking with just a sheet of paper, a pencil, and their collaborative brains. The teens spent over an hour engineering creative space elevators to the moon. This problem was real-world and definitely sparked their interest! There were as many designs as there were groups of teens working collaboratively on the solution. At the end of the day, the activity should provide several opportunities for the youth to experience what scientists and engineers really do:\n- Asking scientific questions\n- Designing investigations or solving problems\n- Using math\n- Constructing explanations\n- Analyzing information\n- Using models to explain phenomena\n- Engaging in argument from evidence\n- Communicating information\nMake it cool to want to do these things… especially for your young girls in your club or program. Making your activities gender friendly for both boys and girls is very important. I encourage you to check out the Click2science STEM Activity Quality Checklist to see how your activity measures up. As club or program leaders we often can sense when things are going right and when they are not. It might be helpful to think about these questions as you design your STEM activity:\n- What will success for your activity look like? - Where were you at the outset of this activity? What do the kids already know about this topic? (establish a baseline so you can measure progress)\n- How will you know that you have been successful? What evidence will you rely upon and hence need to collect to make a judgment on its success? Thoughtful consideration of these ideas can make a club meeting or afterschool program more meaningful to your young people and engage them in true STEM learning. Next month we will talk about how to engage young people in meaningful STEM conversations.

The essence of this range of approaches is that the information is analysed in a way that permits patterns to emerge from within the data itself - ie based on the responses of the informants - rather than being imposed in advance, perhaps incorrectly or simplistically, by the researcher. The study of two or more effects (“dependent variables”) at one time. – A measure of how many people or things in a group were studied by the researcher; followed by an equal sign and a numeral. This refers to analysis of a sample (in this context, a protein) by more than one independent method of analysis. For example, a classical 2-D gel provides two independent, orthogonal parameters, pI and apparent size. MALDI of the intact protein from the gel provides a third dimension, mass, which is an intrinsic property of the protein and is similar, but more useful, than the relative size derived from the SDS dimension. MALDI of the CNBr fragments of the protein directly from the gel provides a true fourth dimension of analysis. analysis of the relationships between three or more variables (as opposed to bivariate analysis, which involves two variables, or univariate analysis which involves one). A statistical analysis technique in which multiple variables are analyzed separately to determine the contribution made by each variable to an observed result. Contrast with univariate analysis. a statistical term refering to analyses that involve a number of different variables. For example, an analysis that looked at whether peer factors and individual factors both influence alcohol use would be called \"multivariate\". A range of techniques that permit the analysis of several variables simultaneously. Most often refers to statistical tests that examine more than two variables at the same time. a generic term for any statistical technique used to analyze data from more than one variable\nAny of several methods for examining multiple variables at the same time. Usage varies. (a) Stricter usage reserves the term for designs with two or more independent variables and two or more dependent variables. (b) More loosely, multivariate analysis applies to designs with more than one independent variable or more than one dependent variable or both. Whichever usage you prefer, either allows researchers to examine the relation between two variables while simultaneously controlling for the influence of other variables. Examples include path analysis, factor analysis, multiple regression analysis, MANOVA, LISREL, canonical correlations, and discriminant analysis. A set of statistical techniques for analyzing the individual and joint effects of a number of factors on the outcomes of the process or disease being studied. Multivariate analysis is a statistical technique that entails the analysis of the relationships between more than two variables. Carrying out multivariate analysis in this research means we could isolate the effect of design on business performance from other factors. See the Detailed research methodology for more information. Product and industrial design This design service covers design of any consumer \/household products, furniture and industrial design such as automotive, engineering and medical products. R&D tax credits for SMEs Research and development (R&D) tax credits are a form of company tax relief which can either reduce a companyâ€(tm)s tax bill or, for some small or medium-sized companies, provide a cash sum. The aim of the tax credits is to encourage greater R&D spending in order to promote investment in innovation. See the HM Customs and Revenue website for more details. the simultaneous study of two or more measures, often involving a relationship with a dependent (outcome) measure. Analysis utilising more than one variable in combination, for example maintaining the wind and pressure fields in balance (Section 8.2.3). The analysis of more than two variables simultaneously, for the purpose of determining the relationship among them. a statistical analysis that involves more than one dependent variable. analysis involving multiple independent or dependent variables. The analysis of relationships between several variables â€“ e.g. factor analysis. is performed when datasets are composed of vector observations. These can consist of observations of different variables at one location or gridpoint values for a particular time sequence. Different multivariate data analysis techniques are used in climate research (see CCA, EOF, SVD, PCA, etc.).\n\nA general knowledge test appropriate for adults was created using materials from a previous study see supplementary materials. The test consisted of 20 multiple choice questions with medium difficulty. Describe any covariates—these are any additional variables that may explain or predict the outcomes. This tells the reader how similarly each response was rated by multiple raters. Report all of the procedures applied for administering the study, processing the data, and for planned data analyses. Data collection methods refers to the general mode of the instruments: surveys, interviews, observations, focus groups, neuroimaging, cognitive tests, and so on. Summarize exactly how you collected the necessary data. Describe all procedures you applied in administering surveys, tests, physical recordings, or imaging devices, with enough detail so that someone else can replicate your techniques. If your procedures are very complicated and require long descriptions e.\nTo report research design, note your overall framework for data collection and analysis. Also note whether a between-subjects or a within-subjects design was used. Describe whether any masking was used to hide the condition assignment e. Using masking in a multi-group study ensures internal validity by reducing bias. Explain how this masking was applied and whether its effectiveness was assessed. Participants were randomly assigned to a control or experimental condition. To begin, all participants were given the AAI and a demographics questionnaire to complete, followed by an unrelated filler task. In the control condition , participants completed a short general knowledge test immediately after the filler task. In the experimental condition, participants were asked to visualize themselves taking the test for 3 minutes before they actually did. For more details on the exact instructions and tasks given, see supplementary materials. In the between-subjects experimental design, the independent variable was whether the visualization intervention was applied and the dependent variable was the difference in test scores between conditions. Data diagnostics Outline all steps taken to scrutinize or process the data after collection. To ensure high validity, you should provide enough detail for your reader to understand how and why you processed or transformed your raw data in these specific ways. The methods section is also where you describe your statistical analysis procedures, but not their outcomes. Their outcomes are reported in the results section. These procedures should be stated for all primary, secondary, and exploratory hypotheses. This annotated example reports methods for a descriptive correlational survey on the relationship between religiosity and trust in science in the US. Hover over each part for explanation of what is included. Example of an APA methods section Methods. The sample included adults aged between 18 and Ethics approval was obtained from the university board before recruitment began. We selected for a geographically diverse sample within the Midwest of the US through an initial screening survey. The primary outcome measures were the levels of religiosity and trust in science. Religiosity refers to involvement and belief in religious traditions, while trust in science represents confidence in scientists and scientific research outcomes. The secondary outcome measures were gender and parental education levels of participants and whether these characteristics predicted religiosity levels. Religiosity was measured using the Centrality of Religiosity scale Huber, The Likert scale is made up of 15 questions with five subscales of ideology, experience, intellect, public practice, and private practice. The internal consistency of the instrument is. Trust in Science. Four Likert scale items were assessed on a scale from 1 completely distrust to 5 completely trust. Potential participants were invited to participate in the survey online using Qualtrics www. The survey consisted of multiple choice questions regarding demographic characteristics, the Centrality of Religiosity scale, an unrelated filler anagram task, and finally the General Trust in Science index. The filler task was included to avoid priming or demand characteristics, and an attention check was embedded within the religiosity scale. For full instructions and details of tasks, see supplementary materials. For this correlational study , we assessed our primary hypothesis of a relationship between religiosity and trust in science using Pearson moment correlation coefficient. The statistical significance of the correlation coefficient was assessed using a t test. To test our secondary hypothesis of parental education levels and gender as predictors of religiosity, multiple linear regression analysis was used. In your APA methods section , you should report detailed information on the participants, materials, and procedures used.\n\nResearch, 2005, Volume 10, Number 2, pages 89-98 Using Personality to Predict Outbound Call Center Job Performance Pamela Skyrme Skyrme & Associates, Inc.

Let’s understand the possible combinations in detail:\nContinuous & Continuous: While doing bi-variate analysis between two continuous variables, we should look at scatter plot. It is a nifty way to find out the relationship between two variables. The pattern of scatter plot indicates the relationship between variables. The relationship can be linear or non-linear. Scatter plot shows the relationship between two variable but does not indicates the strength of relationship amongst them. To find the strength of the relationship, we use Correlation. Correlation varies between -1 and +1. - -1: perfect negative linear correlation\n- +1:perfect positive linear correlation and\n- 0: No correlation\nCorrelation can be derived using following formula:\nCorrelation = Covariance(X,Y) \/ SQRT( Var(X)* Var(Y))\nVarious tools have function or functionality to identify correlation between variables. In Excel, function CORREL() is used to return the correlation between two variables and SAS uses procedure PROC CORR to identify the correlation. These function returns Pearson Correlation value to identify the relationship between two variables:\nIn above example, we have good positive relationship(0.65) between two variables X and Y.\nCategorical & Categorical: To find the relationship between two categorical variables, we can use following methods:\n- Two-way table: We can start analyzing the relationship by creating a two-way table of count and count%. The rows represents the category of one variable and the columns represent the categories of the other variable. We show count or count% of observations available in each combination of row and column categories. - Stacked Column Chart: This method is more of a visual form of Two-way table. - Chi-Square Test: This test is used to derive the statistical significance of relationship between the variables. Also, it tests whether the evidence in the sample is strong enough to generalize that the relationship for a larger population as well. Chi-square is based on the difference between the expected and observed frequencies in one or more categories in the two-way table. It returns probability for the computed chi-square distribution with the degree of freedom. Probability of 0: It indicates that both categorical variable are dependent\nProbability of 1: It shows that both variables are independent. Probability less than 0.05: It indicates that the relationship between the variables is significant at 95% confidence. The chi-square test statistic for a test of independence of two categorical variables is found by:\nwhere O represents the observed frequency. E is the expected frequency under the null hypothesis and computed by:\nFrom previous two-way table, the expected count for product category 1 to be of small size is 0.22. It is derived by taking the row total for Size (9) times the column total for Product category (2) then dividing by the sample size (81). This is procedure is conducted for each cell. Statistical Measures used to analyze the power of relationship are:\n- Cramer’s V for Nominal Categorical Variable\n- Mantel-Haenszed Chi-Square for ordinal categorical variable. Different data science language and tools have specific methods to perform chi-square test. In SAS, we can use Chisq as an option with Proc freq to perform this test. Categorical & Continuous: While exploring relation between categorical and continuous variables, we can draw box plots for each level of categorical variables. If levels are small in number, it will not show the statistical significance. To look at the statistical significance we can perform Z-test, T-test or ANOVA. - Z-Test\/ T-Test:- Either test assess whether mean of two groups are statistically different from each other or not.If the probability of Z is small then the difference of two averages is more significant. The T-test is very similar to Z-test but it is used when number of observation for both categories is less than 30. - ANOVA:- It assesses whether the average of more than two groups is statistically different. Example: Suppose, we want to test the effect of five different exercises. For this, we recruit 20 men and assign one type of exercise to 4 men (5 groups). Their weights are recorded after a few weeks. We need to find out whether the effect of these exercises on them is significantly different or not.\n\nReferences to specific technologies were replaced with just “technology”. Unsuccessful adaptations, or items that were now too similar, were again removed, resulting in 51 items being used for a pilot study. These covered expected aspects of usefulness, enjoyment, ease, confidence, interest, support, and importance. The items included positive and reversed items in order to combat acquiescence bias (Oppenheim, 1998). A small pilot survey (n = 24) was conducted to validate the instrument. It used students from the participant pool expected for the main study, and got a good spread of participants from the target groups (different ages, disciplines, etc). The questionnaire was trialled, and participants interviewed to determine if any questions were unclear, and if they felt anything was missing from the survey. The pilot data was initially checked for errors (e.g. due to duplicate questions). A correlation matrix was checked for items that were highly correlated (> 0.8) with other items (Field, 2005). Where this was found, it was always due to items asking about similar concepts; in all cases, the more clearly-worded item was kept and the other item removed (Oppenheim, 1998). From this, 37 items remained. A principal components analysis (PCA) was run. In order to do this, Horn’s parallel analysis was used to determine how many factors to extract (Horn, 1965). Parallel analysis is considered to be the most accurate method of factor extraction since it outperforms the K1 rule and scree plots (Ledesma & Valero-Mora, 2007; Matsunaga, 2010; O’Connor, 2000; Zwick & Velicer, 1986). Two factors were identified from the parallel analysis. The PCA showed two items loaded onto both factors with a difference of less than 0.4 between the primary and secondary loadings, so these were discarded (Matsunaga, 2010). The first factor contained items about attitudes about technology utility, and the second factor contained items about comfort and confidence when using technology. Internal consistency of the whole attitudes section was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, and was found to be 0.935. The coefficient is sufficiently high, above the minimum recommendation of 0.7 (Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994). It is common for tests with higher numbers of items to result in higher levels of alpha (Tavakol & Dennick, 2011), so the relatively high number of items in this test may explain why alpha is so high. After piloting and validation, 35 items were accepted for use in the final instrument for the main study, which will now be discussed. Technology attitude questionnaire\nThe new instrument is called the Technology Attitude Questionnaire (TAQ), and adapts its 35 attitude items from Al-Emran et al. (2016), Bonanno, and Kommers, P.a.M. (2008), , Edmunds et al. (2012), Jay and Willis (1992), Garland and Noyes (2005), Knezek, Christensen, and Miyashita (1998), Lee and Clarke (2015), Liaw, Huang, and Chen (2007), Nguyen, Hseih, and Allen (2006), Pierce, Stacey, and Barkatsas (2007), Saadé and Kira (2007), Sagin Simsek (2008), Teo (2008), and Teo, Lee, and Chai (2008). In addition to this attitudes section, questions about how students use technology were also included. The TAQ was administered online using Survey Monkey. A copy of the final TAQ is included in the supplementary materials. The TAQ is divided into three sections. The first section gives students a list of 24 types of technology, both hardware (e.g., laptops, mobile telephones, televisions, e-readers) and software (e.g., social networking, office suites, online forums, videos), and explores which of these they have used for course activities, non-course activities, or both. The second section asks how often they use each of the technologies (daily, weekly, monthly, less often than monthly, never, adapted from Kennedy et al. (2010)), and how long they have been using them (less than a year, 1–2 years, 3–5 years, 6–10 years, more than 10 years, never). These first two sections satisfy the behavioural component of attitude, as they describe how the student uses technology (Di Martino & Zan, 2010). The third section explores students’ attitudes to technology and attempts to find underlying factors.\n\n2008\/9 Schools Wikipedia Selection. Related subjects: Mathematics\nStatistics is a mathematical science pertaining to the collection, analysis, interpretation or explanation, and presentation of data. It is applicable to a wide variety of academic disciplines, from the natural and social sciences to the humanities, and to government and business. Statistical methods can be used to summarize or describe a collection of data; this is called descriptive statistics. In addition, patterns in the data may be modeled in a way that accounts for randomness and uncertainty in the observations, and then used to draw inferences about the process or population being studied; this is called inferential statistics. Both descriptive and inferential statistics comprise applied statistics. There is also a discipline called mathematical statistics, which is concerned with the theoretical basis of the subject. The word statistics is also the plural of statistic (singular), which refers to the result of applying a statistical algorithm to a set of data, as in economic statistics, crime statistics, etc. Statistics arose, no later than the 18th century, from the need of states to collect data on their people and economies, in order to administer them. Its meaning broadened in the early 19th century to include the collection and analysis of data in general. Today statistics is widely employed in government, business, and the natural and social sciences. Because of its origins in government and its data-centric world view, statistics is considered to be not a subfield of mathematics but rather a distinct field that uses mathematics. Its mathematical foundations were laid in the 17th and 18th centuries with the development of probability theory. The method of least squares, a central technique of the discipline, was invented in the early 19th century by several authors. Since then new techniques of probability and statistics have been in continual development. Modern computers have expedited large-scale statistical computation, and have also made possible new methods that would be impractical to perform manually. In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or societal problem, one begins with a process or population to be studied. This might be a population of people in a country, of crystal grains in a rock, or of goods manufactured by a particular factory during a given period. It may instead be a process observed at various times; data collected about this kind of \"population\" constitute what is called a time series. For practical reasons, rather than compiling data about an entire population, one usually studies a chosen subset of the population, called a sample. Data are collected about the sample in an observational or experimental setting. The data are then subjected to statistical analysis, which serves two related purposes: description and inference. - Descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the data, either numerically or graphically, to describe the sample. Basic examples of numerical descriptors include the mean and standard deviation. Graphical summarizations include various kinds of charts and graphs. - Inferential statistics is used to model patterns in the data, accounting for randomness and drawing inferences about the larger population. These inferences may take the form of answers to yes\/no questions ( hypothesis testing), estimates of numerical characteristics ( estimation), descriptions of association (correlation), or modeling of relationships (regression). Other modeling techniques include ANOVA, time series, and data mining. |“… it is only the manipulation of uncertainty that interests us. We are not concerned with the matter that is uncertain. Thus we do not study the mechanism of rain; only whether it will rain.”\nDennis Lindley, \"The Philosophy of Statistics\", The Statistician (2000). The concept of correlation is particularly noteworthy. Statistical analysis of a data set may reveal that two variables (that is, two properties of the population under consideration) tend to vary together, as if they are connected. For example, a study of annual income and age of death among people might find that poor people tend to have shorter lives than affluent people. The two variables are said to be correlated. However, one cannot immediately infer the existence of a causal relationship between the two variables (see Correlation does not imply causation). The correlated phenomena could be caused by a third, previously unconsidered phenomenon, called a lurking variable.","passages":[{"passage":"Stem Friends: Friendships and STEM interest\nDiscovering the role that 4th and 5th-grade friendships have to play in children’s STEM interest\nMost parents understand that their child’s friendships hold great influence on their perceptions, hobbies, and interests – but today, our Data Scientist, David Meier, provides us with some interesting evidence that demonstrates how your children’s friends feel about STEM may greatly impact your own child’s STEM interest! Interesting results emerged when we analyzed data from our Camp Invention Research Project: Institute for Learning Innovation study regarding what STEM areas girls and boys enjoy learning about. Using a five-point rating scale with five being the highest, we asked 485 fourth and fifth-grade Camp Invention participants how much they liked finding out about or learning about various STEM topics. These topics were selected to measure interest in three main STEM areas: Life Science, Earth Science, and Technology and Engineering. Utilizing T-Tests, we found that the 209 girls liked finding out about Life Science more than the 276 boys (average rating of 3.69 to 3.37) and that the boys liked finding out about Technology and Engineering more than the girls (average rating of 4.18 to 3.98). While this finding may not be overly surprising to some people, what we found particularly interesting is that no statistically significant difference was found between the reported liking of finding out about Earth Science between the girls and the boys (average rating of 4.15 and 4.00). We also asked the participants to rate their agreement to the question, “My friends think science and engineering are cool.”\nUtilizing regression models, we found there to be a statistically significant and positive relationship between a participant’s friends thinking science and engineering are cool and their own enjoyment in finding out about all three of the STEM areas! Interestingly, while no difference in the average rating for liking learning about Earth Science was found between the girls and the boys, the relationship between girls’ friends thinking science and engineering is cool and their rating of liking finding out about Earth Science was stronger than for the boys. Indeed, for the girls, we found that for every one-unit increase in the rating of their friends’ thinking science and engineering is cool we could predict a corresponding increase of .21 units in their own rating of liking finding out about Earth Science (the predicted increase for the boys was .19 units). While the statistical tests we utilized don’t prove causation, their statistically significant and predictive quality provides us evidence that there definitely is a positive relationship between friends’ attitudes towards science and engineering and a child’s own enjoyment in finding out about Life Science, Earth Science, and Technology and Engineering. Parents, have you found this to be displayed in your own children’s friendships? For more information on these findings, feel free to contact Data Scientist, David Meier.

As we talked about last month, the Internet is chock-full of sites claiming that their activities will turn your young people into scientists and engineers. We know however that all STEM activities are not created equal and it can be challenging to find the right fit for your club or program. Execution, or how you facilitate the STEM activities, is also really important. We will talk about that in future posts! Look for activities that focus on real world things that your young people will be interested in and will spark their curiosity. It is also helpful if the activity has multiple creative solutions and not just one right answer. Here on campus we run a program called Teen Science Café where high school students work with one of our Rutgers scientists or engineers to learn about current research on a STEM topic of their interest. The teens invited an engineer, Dr. Benaroya, to explore the idea of moving to another planet? Dr. Benaroya completely engaged the teens in engineering and design thinking with just a sheet of paper, a pencil, and their collaborative brains. The teens spent over an hour engineering creative space elevators to the moon. This problem was real-world and definitely sparked their interest! There were as many designs as there were groups of teens working collaboratively on the solution. At the end of the day, the activity should provide several opportunities for the youth to experience what scientists and engineers really do:\n- Asking scientific questions\n- Designing investigations or solving problems\n- Using math\n- Constructing explanations\n- Analyzing information\n- Using models to explain phenomena\n- Engaging in argument from evidence\n- Communicating information\nMake it cool to want to do these things… especially for your young girls in your club or program. Making your activities gender friendly for both boys and girls is very important. I encourage you to check out the Click2science STEM Activity Quality Checklist to see how your activity measures up. As club or program leaders we often can sense when things are going right and when they are not. It might be helpful to think about these questions as you design your STEM activity:\n- What will success for your activity look like? - Where were you at the outset of this activity? What do the kids already know about this topic? (establish a baseline so you can measure progress)\n- How will you know that you have been successful? What evidence will you rely upon and hence need to collect to make a judgment on its success? Thoughtful consideration of these ideas can make a club meeting or afterschool program more meaningful to your young people and engage them in true STEM learning. Next month we will talk about how to engage young people in meaningful STEM conversations.

The essence of this range of approaches is that the information is analysed in a way that permits patterns to emerge from within the data itself - ie based on the responses of the informants - rather than being imposed in advance, perhaps incorrectly or simplistically, by the researcher. The study of two or more effects (“dependent variables”) at one time. – A measure of how many people or things in a group were studied by the researcher; followed by an equal sign and a numeral. This refers to analysis of a sample (in this context, a protein) by more than one independent method of analysis. For example, a classical 2-D gel provides two independent, orthogonal parameters, pI and apparent size. MALDI of the intact protein from the gel provides a third dimension, mass, which is an intrinsic property of the protein and is similar, but more useful, than the relative size derived from the SDS dimension. MALDI of the CNBr fragments of the protein directly from the gel provides a true fourth dimension of analysis. analysis of the relationships between three or more variables (as opposed to bivariate analysis, which involves two variables, or univariate analysis which involves one). A statistical analysis technique in which multiple variables are analyzed separately to determine the contribution made by each variable to an observed result. Contrast with univariate analysis. a statistical term refering to analyses that involve a number of different variables. For example, an analysis that looked at whether peer factors and individual factors both influence alcohol use would be called \"multivariate\". A range of techniques that permit the analysis of several variables simultaneously. Most often refers to statistical tests that examine more than two variables at the same time. a generic term for any statistical technique used to analyze data from more than one variable\nAny of several methods for examining multiple variables at the same time. Usage varies. (a) Stricter usage reserves the term for designs with two or more independent variables and two or more dependent variables. (b) More loosely, multivariate analysis applies to designs with more than one independent variable or more than one dependent variable or both. Whichever usage you prefer, either allows researchers to examine the relation between two variables while simultaneously controlling for the influence of other variables. Examples include path analysis, factor analysis, multiple regression analysis, MANOVA, LISREL, canonical correlations, and discriminant analysis. A set of statistical techniques for analyzing the individual and joint effects of a number of factors on the outcomes of the process or disease being studied. Multivariate analysis is a statistical technique that entails the analysis of the relationships between more than two variables.

Religiosity refers to involvement and belief in religious traditions, while trust in science represents confidence in scientists and scientific research outcomes. The secondary outcome measures were gender and parental education levels of participants and whether these characteristics predicted religiosity levels. Religiosity was measured using the Centrality of Religiosity scale Huber, The Likert scale is made up of 15 questions with five subscales of ideology, experience, intellect, public practice, and private practice. The internal consistency of the instrument is. Trust in Science. Four Likert scale items were assessed on a scale from 1 completely distrust to 5 completely trust. Potential participants were invited to participate in the survey online using Qualtrics www. The survey consisted of multiple choice questions regarding demographic characteristics, the Centrality of Religiosity scale, an unrelated filler anagram task, and finally the General Trust in Science index. The filler task was included to avoid priming or demand characteristics, and an attention check was embedded within the religiosity scale. For full instructions and details of tasks, see supplementary materials. For this correlational study , we assessed our primary hypothesis of a relationship between religiosity and trust in science using Pearson moment correlation coefficient.

Let’s understand the possible combinations in detail:\nContinuous & Continuous: While doing bi-variate analysis between two continuous variables, we should look at scatter plot. It is a nifty way to find out the relationship between two variables. The pattern of scatter plot indicates the relationship between variables. The relationship can be linear or non-linear. Scatter plot shows the relationship between two variable but does not indicates the strength of relationship amongst them. To find the strength of the relationship, we use Correlation. Correlation varies between -1 and +1. - -1: perfect negative linear correlation\n- +1:perfect positive linear correlation and\n- 0: No correlation\nCorrelation can be derived using following formula:\nCorrelation = Covariance(X,Y) \/ SQRT( Var(X)* Var(Y))\nVarious tools have function or functionality to identify correlation between variables. In Excel, function CORREL() is used to return the correlation between two variables and SAS uses procedure PROC CORR to identify the correlation. These function returns Pearson Correlation value to identify the relationship between two variables:\nIn above example, we have good positive relationship(0.65) between two variables X and Y.\nCategorical & Categorical: To find the relationship between two categorical variables, we can use following methods:\n- Two-way table: We can start analyzing the relationship by creating a two-way table of count and count%. The rows represents the category of one variable and the columns represent the categories of the other variable. We show count or count% of observations available in each combination of row and column categories. - Stacked Column Chart: This method is more of a visual form of Two-way table. - Chi-Square Test: This test is used to derive the statistical significance of relationship between the variables. Also, it tests whether the evidence in the sample is strong enough to generalize that the relationship for a larger population as well. Chi-square is based on the difference between the expected and observed frequencies in one or more categories in the two-way table. It returns probability for the computed chi-square distribution with the degree of freedom. Probability of 0: It indicates that both categorical variable are dependent\nProbability of 1: It shows that both variables are independent. Probability less than 0.05: It indicates that the relationship between the variables is significant at 95% confidence. The chi-square test statistic for a test of independence of two categorical variables is found by:\nwhere O represents the observed frequency. E is the expected frequency under the null hypothesis and computed by:\nFrom previous two-way table, the expected count for product category 1 to be of small size is 0.22. It is derived by taking the row total for Size (9) times the column total for Product category (2) then dividing by the sample size (81). This is procedure is conducted for each cell. Statistical Measures used to analyze the power of relationship are:\n- Cramer’s V for Nominal Categorical Variable\n- Mantel-Haenszed Chi-Square for ordinal categorical variable. Different data science language and tools have specific methods to perform chi-square test. In SAS, we can use Chisq as an option with Proc freq to perform this test. Categorical & Continuous: While exploring relation between categorical and continuous variables, we can draw box plots for each level of categorical variables. If levels are small in number, it will not show the statistical significance. To look at the statistical significance we can perform Z-test, T-test or ANOVA. - Z-Test\/ T-Test:- Either test assess whether mean of two groups are statistically different from each other or not.If the probability of Z is small then the difference of two averages is more significant. The T-test is very similar to Z-test but it is used when number of observation for both categories is less than 30. - ANOVA:- It assesses whether the average of more than two groups is statistically different. Example: Suppose, we want to test the effect of five different exercises. For this, we recruit 20 men and assign one type of exercise to 4 men (5 groups). Their weights are recorded after a few weeks. We need to find out whether the effect of these exercises on them is significantly different or not.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:f9216a37-f874-4aad-920b-19877fcc9a41>"]},{"passage":"References to specific technologies were replaced with just “technology”. Unsuccessful adaptations, or items that were now too similar, were again removed, resulting in 51 items being used for a pilot study. These covered expected aspects of usefulness, enjoyment, ease, confidence, interest, support, and importance. The items included positive and reversed items in order to combat acquiescence bias (Oppenheim, 1998). A small pilot survey (n = 24) was conducted to validate the instrument. It used students from the participant pool expected for the main study, and got a good spread of participants from the target groups (different ages, disciplines, etc). The questionnaire was trialled, and participants interviewed to determine if any questions were unclear, and if they felt anything was missing from the survey. The pilot data was initially checked for errors (e.g. due to duplicate questions). A correlation matrix was checked for items that were highly correlated (> 0.8) with other items (Field, 2005). Where this was found, it was always due to items asking about similar concepts; in all cases, the more clearly-worded item was kept and the other item removed (Oppenheim, 1998). From this, 37 items remained. A principal components analysis (PCA) was run. In order to do this, Horn’s parallel analysis was used to determine how many factors to extract (Horn, 1965). Parallel analysis is considered to be the most accurate method of factor extraction since it outperforms the K1 rule and scree plots (Ledesma & Valero-Mora, 2007; Matsunaga, 2010; O’Connor, 2000; Zwick & Velicer, 1986). Two factors were identified from the parallel analysis. The PCA showed two items loaded onto both factors with a difference of less than 0.4 between the primary and secondary loadings, so these were discarded (Matsunaga, 2010). The first factor contained items about attitudes about technology utility, and the second factor contained items about comfort and confidence when using technology. Internal consistency of the whole attitudes section was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, and was found to be 0.935. The coefficient is sufficiently high, above the minimum recommendation of 0.7 (Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994). It is common for tests with higher numbers of items to result in higher levels of alpha (Tavakol & Dennick, 2011), so the relatively high number of items in this test may explain why alpha is so high. After piloting and validation, 35 items were accepted for use in the final instrument for the main study, which will now be discussed. Technology attitude questionnaire\nThe new instrument is called the Technology Attitude Questionnaire (TAQ), and adapts its 35 attitude items from Al-Emran et al. (2016), Bonanno, and Kommers, P.a.M. (2008), , Edmunds et al. (2012), Jay and Willis (1992), Garland and Noyes (2005), Knezek, Christensen, and Miyashita (1998), Lee and Clarke (2015), Liaw, Huang, and Chen (2007), Nguyen, Hseih, and Allen (2006), Pierce, Stacey, and Barkatsas (2007), Saadé and Kira (2007), Sagin Simsek (2008), Teo (2008), and Teo, Lee, and Chai (2008). In addition to this attitudes section, questions about how students use technology were also included. The TAQ was administered online using Survey Monkey. A copy of the final TAQ is included in the supplementary materials. The TAQ is divided into three sections. The first section gives students a list of 24 types of technology, both hardware (e.g., laptops, mobile telephones, televisions, e-readers) and software (e.g., social networking, office suites, online forums, videos), and explores which of these they have used for course activities, non-course activities, or both. The second section asks how often they use each of the technologies (daily, weekly, monthly, less often than monthly, never, adapted from Kennedy et al. (2010)), and how long they have been using them (less than a year, 1–2 years, 3–5 years, 6–10 years, more than 10 years, never). These first two sections satisfy the behavioural component of attitude, as they describe how the student uses technology (Di Martino & Zan, 2010). The third section explores students’ attitudes to technology and attempts to find underlying factors.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:2767e4e1-1b58-45d8-8cfe-ec79430e9853>"]},{"passage":"2008\/9 Schools Wikipedia Selection. Related subjects: Mathematics\nStatistics is a mathematical science pertaining to the collection, analysis, interpretation or explanation, and presentation of data. It is applicable to a wide variety of academic disciplines, from the natural and social sciences to the humanities, and to government and business. Statistical methods can be used to summarize or describe a collection of data; this is called descriptive statistics. In addition, patterns in the data may be modeled in a way that accounts for randomness and uncertainty in the observations, and then used to draw inferences about the process or population being studied; this is called inferential statistics. Both descriptive and inferential statistics comprise applied statistics. There is also a discipline called mathematical statistics, which is concerned with the theoretical basis of the subject. The word statistics is also the plural of statistic (singular), which refers to the result of applying a statistical algorithm to a set of data, as in economic statistics, crime statistics, etc. Statistics arose, no later than the 18th century, from the need of states to collect data on their people and economies, in order to administer them. Its meaning broadened in the early 19th century to include the collection and analysis of data in general. Today statistics is widely employed in government, business, and the natural and social sciences. Because of its origins in government and its data-centric world view, statistics is considered to be not a subfield of mathematics but rather a distinct field that uses mathematics. Its mathematical foundations were laid in the 17th and 18th centuries with the development of probability theory. The method of least squares, a central technique of the discipline, was invented in the early 19th century by several authors. Since then new techniques of probability and statistics have been in continual development. Modern computers have expedited large-scale statistical computation, and have also made possible new methods that would be impractical to perform manually. In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or societal problem, one begins with a process or population to be studied. This might be a population of people in a country, of crystal grains in a rock, or of goods manufactured by a particular factory during a given period. It may instead be a process observed at various times; data collected about this kind of \"population\" constitute what is called a time series. For practical reasons, rather than compiling data about an entire population, one usually studies a chosen subset of the population, called a sample. Data are collected about the sample in an observational or experimental setting. The data are then subjected to statistical analysis, which serves two related purposes: description and inference. - Descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the data, either numerically or graphically, to describe the sample. Basic examples of numerical descriptors include the mean and standard deviation. Graphical summarizations include various kinds of charts and graphs. - Inferential statistics is used to model patterns in the data, accounting for randomness and drawing inferences about the larger population. These inferences may take the form of answers to yes\/no questions ( hypothesis testing), estimates of numerical characteristics ( estimation), descriptions of association (correlation), or modeling of relationships (regression). Other modeling techniques include ANOVA, time series, and data mining. |“… it is only the manipulation of uncertainty that interests us. We are not concerned with the matter that is uncertain. Thus we do not study the mechanism of rain; only whether it will rain.”\nDennis Lindley, \"The Philosophy of Statistics\", The Statistician (2000). The concept of correlation is particularly noteworthy. Statistical analysis of a data set may reveal that two variables (that is, two properties of the population under consideration) tend to vary together, as if they are connected. For example, a study of annual income and age of death among people might find that poor people tend to have shorter lives than affluent people. The two variables are said to be correlated. However, one cannot immediately infer the existence of a causal relationship between the two variables (see Correlation does not imply causation).

Applying ideas from theoretical computer science, such as analysis of algorithms and computational complexity, enables us to place optical computing in a framework where we can try to answer a number of important questions. For example,which problems are optical computers suitable for solving? Also, how does the resource usage on optical computers compare with more standard (e.g. digital electronic) architectures? The physical principles behind some efficiencies in optical computing are outlined here. 1. Fan-in efficiency\nKirchoff’s Law is well understood in analog electronics as a natural and constant time means of summing the current at the intersection of an arbitrary number of wires. In optics, the same thing is possible by directing several light beams towards a point detector with a linear response to incident light. Such an optical arrangement sums n non-negative integers in O(1) addition steps. On a model of a sequential digital electronic computer this would require n − 1 addition operations and even many typical (bounded fan-in)parallel models, with n or more processors, take O(log n) time steps. Tasks that rely on scalar summation operations (such as matrix multiplication) would benefit greatly from an optical implementation of the scalar sum operation. Similarly, O(1) multiplication and O(1) convolution operations can be realised optically. Very recently, an optics-based digital signal processing platform has been marketed that claims digital processing speeds of tera (10^12) operations per second. 2. Efficiency in interconnection complexity\nAs optical pathways can cross in free space without measurable effect on the information in either channel, high interconnection densities are possible with optics. Architectures with highly parallel many-to-many interconnections between parallel surfaces have already been proposed for common tasks such as sorting. Currently, intrachip, inter-chip, and inter-board connections are being investigated for manufacturing feasibility. 3. Energy efficiency\nElectrical wires suffer from induced noise and heat, which increases dramatically whenever wires are made thinner or placed closer together, or whenever the data throughput is increased. As a direct consequence of their resistance free pathways and noise-reduced environments, optical systems have the potential to generate less waste heat and so consume less energy per computation step than electronic systems. This has beend emonstrated experimentally with general purpose digital optical processors.\n\nResearchers at the Technische Universität Darmstadt in Germany have managed to stop light for up to one minute inside a crystal and store digitally-encoded information inside it. The technique shatters previous records and could prove very useful in developing faster and highly-efficient quantum and optical computers. The switch to photonics\nToday's technologies use semiconductor-based processors and storage devices to compute and store data electronically. However, with data being increasingly transmitted in the optical regime (e.g. through fiber optics), switching to all-optical components is appearing more and more like an appealing prospect. Photons are much harder to interact with and manipulate than electrons, but if this hurdle can be cleared, switching from electronics to a photonics ecosystem would bring about many key advantages. Electronic components dissipate a large portion of energy as heat, whereas in photonics components losses are very limited. Optical storage and computation would also be resistant to radiation, have a much higher transmission bandwidth, and allow for the manipulation of a single photon at a time, which would translate into better performance at a tiny fraction of the energy cost. \"Although classical data storage already offers very high read\/write rates, optical data storage has the potential to be much faster,\" Georg Heinze, who was part of the research team, told Gizmag. \"If everything operates in the optical regime there is no need to convert optical pulses in electronic signals and vice versa.\" Bringing light to a halt\nTo store data in a photonics device, the researchers use a technique known as electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). EIT consists of firing a laser \"control beam\" at a crystal which contains ions of the element praseodymium. The laser triggers a quantum reaction in the crystal that has two contemporary effects. First, it makes this normally opaque crystal transparent over a narrow spectrum; and secondly, it changes the refractive index of the crystal dramatically, slowing the incoming light pulse down to a complete halt. At this point, the researchers fire a second laser beam (containing the information to be stored) at the crystal. At the precise moment in which the laser beam carrying the information is crossing the temporarily transparent crystal, the control beam is turned off, trapping light and information inside the now opaque crystal. The photons are converted into atomic spin excitations (or \"spin waves\"), which can be stored in the crystal until the control beam is fired again and the spin waves are turned back into light, which finally escapes the crystal. Scientists have used this technique in previous experiments, but they could only use it to store data for a few millionths of a second. This is because the spin wave is very delicate, subject to energy fluctuations that can corrupt the information it encodes. The TU Darmstadt team figured out how they could prolong this storage time significantly. Their approach was to develop an algorithm that senses the noise and applies magnetic fields and high-frequency pulses to the crystal to maintain the spin wave in its original state, so that the information is kept safe for as long as possible – up to a minute. \"In this first proof-of-principle experiment we focused on long storage times rather than on transfer rates,\" says Heinze. \"However, we showed that by image storage it is possible to increase the storage capacity of the memory, and this is very important feature for spatially multiplexed quantum memories.\" The researchers are now building on this result to try and store light for even longer periods of time (up to a week) in a more energy-efficient way while achieving higher data transfer rates. In a word of caution, however, Heinze points out that it will probably be several years before this technology is ready for commercial use, and possibly decades before all-photonics devices become the norm in consumer devices. The team's research appears on the journal Physical Review Letters.\n\nScientists \"freeze\" light inside a crystal for one minute\nResearchers at the Technische Universität Darmstadt in Germany have managed to stop light for up to one minute inside a crystal and store digitally-encoded information inside it.

The team's research appears on the journal Physical Review Letters.\n\nScientists from the University of Oxford have developed a tiny nanoscale device that can be programmed using either photons or electrons. This electro-optical device is a bridge between traditional electronic computing and the emerging field of optical computing, and it could lead to faster and more energy-efficient processors and memory in the future. “Computing at the speed of light has been an enticing but elusive prospect, but with this development, it’s now in tangible proximity,” Phys.org reports. Scientists have been trying to use light to transfer information extremely fast since the 1950s. However, there are practical limitations of how light can be used in this manner, especially when trying to integrate it along with electronic computing hardware. The problem is that electrical chips operate most efficiently when they are small in size, but optical chips benefit from being larger. This is because the wavelength of light is larger than that of electrons. The new device uses light which has been compressed into a small size, in a process called surface plasmon polariton. This allows optical chips to be integrated along with electrical chips because now the sizes are more comparable. The ability for devices to work in both electrical and optical domains, without the need for conversion, allows the creation of dual functionalities that can use both photons and electrons for processing. “This is a very promising path forward in computation and especially in fields where high processing efficiency is needed,” Nikolaos Farmakidis, graduate student and co-first author, said in a statement. There are many potential uses of this technology, but the current focus is on applications that require a large amount of processing power, such as artificial intelligence. The new device can improve on current technology like complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication of MOSFETs, which are the transistors that form the basis of many modern digital circuits. Co-author Nathan Youngblood explains the potential applications for the new nanoscale device: “This naturally includes artificial intelligence applications where on many occasions, the needs for high-performance, low-power computing far exceeds our current capabilities. It is believed that interfacing light-based photonic computing with its electrical counterpart is the key to the next chapter in CMOS technologies.”\nThe findings are published in the journal Science Advances.\n\nMobile communication for voice applications (e.g., cellular phone) is widely established throughout the world and witnesses a very rapid growth in all its dimensions including the increase in the number of subscribers of various cellular networks. An extension of this technology is the ability to send and receive data across various cellular networks using small devices such as smartphones. There can be numerous applications based on this technology; for example, video call or conferencing is one of the important applications that people prefer to use in place of existing voice (only) communications on mobile phones. Mobile computing–based applications are becoming very important and rapidly evolving with various technological advancements as it allows users to transmit data from remote locations to other remote or fixed locations. 1.9 Quantum Computing\nManufacturers of computing systems say that there is a limit for cram-ming more and more transistors into smaller and smaller spaces of inte-grated circuits (ICs) and thereby doubling the processing power about every 18 months. This problem will have to be overcome by a new quantum\ncomputing–based solution, wherein the dependence is on quantum\n7 Computing Paradigms\n1.10 Optical Computing\nOptical computing system uses the photons in visible light or infrared beams, rather than electric current, to perform digital computations. An elec-tric current flows at only about 10% of the speed of light. This limits the rate at which data can be exchanged over long distances and is one of the factors that led to the evolution of optical fiber. By applying some of the advantages of visible and\/or IR networks at the device and component scale, a computer can be developed that can perform operations 10 or more times faster than a conventional electronic computer. Nanocomputing refers to computing systems that are constructed from nanoscale components. The silicon transistors in traditional computers may be replaced by transistors based on carbon nanotubes. The successful realization of nanocomputers relates to the scale and inte-gration of these nanotubes or components. The issues of scale relate to the dimensions of the components; they are, at most, a few nanometers in at least two dimensions. The issues of integration of the components are twofold: first, the manufacture of complex arbitrary patterns may be economically infeasible, and second, nanocomputers may include massive quantities of devices. Researchers are working on all these issues to bring nanocomputing a reality. 1.12 Network Computing\nAlmost all the computing paradigms that were discussed earlier are of this nature. Even in the future, if any one invents a totally new computing para-digm, it would be based on a networked architecture, without which it is impossible to realize the benefits for any end user. We are into a post-PC era, in which a greater number and a variety of com-puters and computing paradigms with different sizes and functions might be used everywhere and with every human being; so, the purpose of this chap-ter is to illustrate briefly the ideas of all these computing domains, as most of these are ubiquitous and pervasive in its access and working environment. • Mobile computing: Mobile computing consists of small processing elements (i.e., handheld devices) and the communication between various resources is by using wireless media (see Section 1.8). • Nanocomputing: Makes use of nanoscale components (see Section 1.11). 1. Why is it necessary to understand the various computing paradigms? 2. Compare grid computing with electric power grid\n3. Will mobile computing play a dominant role in the future? Discuss 4. How are distributed computing and network computing different or\n5. How may nanocomputing shape future devices? Ditto, W. L., A. Miliotis, K. Murali, and S. Sinha. The chaos computing paradigm. Cloud Computing Fundamentals\nThe objectives of this chapter are to\n• Understand the basic ideas and motivation for cloud computing • To define cloud computing\n• Understand the 5-4-3 principles of cloud computing and cloud ecosystem\n• Understand the working of a cloud application\n• Have a brief understanding on the benefits and drawbacks in cloud computing\n2.1 Motivation for Cloud Computing\nLet us review the scenario of computing prior to the announcement and availability of cloud computing: The users who are in need of computing are expected to invest money on computing resources such as hardware, software, networking, and storage; this investment naturally costs a bulk currency to the users as they have to buy these computing resources, keep these in their premises, and maintain and make it operational—all these tasks would add cost.\n\nWhen co-author Zhaoming Zhu, Gauthier's postdoctoral research associate, encoded information onto one of these beams, the data could be imprinted on these newly created phonons and retained for 12 billionths of a second, long enough to be transferred back to light again by shining a third laser through the fiber. \"When thinking about how to store light in optical fibers,\" Zhu says, \"we realized that we can convert optical information to acoustic vibration, something that hasn't been done before.\" The researchers are seeking ways to create longer storage times and reduce the peak power of the laser beam needed for retaining and reading out the information, a process that will take years before a commercial version of the technology is available. \"There is still a great need for developing new strategies for optimizing the flow of information over the Internet,\" says Robert Boyd, a professor of optics and physics at the Institute of Optics and a research co-author. \"If two data packets arrive at a switch at the same time, you need to store one until the other packet clears the switch, maybe 100 nanoseconds later. Our technique is aimed at … building buffers for high-speed telecommunications.\" During the first phase of the project—which is part of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Defense Sciences Office slow-light program—Zhu says he learned that pulses could be stored and read out at a later time. The second phase was the actual experiment in which data pulses were stored (as acoustic waves in an optical fiber) and retrieved after a certain period of time. \"We really want to demonstrate that methods for storing optical information are much broader than people thought,\" Gauthier says. \"In the current telecommunication systems, you turn the optical signal into an electronic signal and store it in RAM. The optical data pulses are then regenerated by using the electrical signals to turn on and off an auxiliary laser source. But this process generates heat. The faster this is done, the more heat is generated.\" For this to work in the real world, the scientists say the communication fibers must be made of a material that provides an acoustic time frame long enough to allow the information to move from optical to sound, then return to optical. One option, Gauthier says, is to work with a new type of glass made from a chalcogenide, which has good semiconductor properties and contains one or more elements from the periodic table's chalcogenide group, also known as the \"oxygen family,\" which includes oxygen, sulfur, selenium and tellurium. Another option that researchers are exploring is to run the laser beams through a hollow optical fiber filled with gas (such as xenon), which would allow them to use a less powerful laser to induce longer lasting sound waves in the gas. This could potentially create a sound wave 50 times longer and allow the lasers used to be 100 times less powerful—and less energy intensive—thereby delivering more data more quickly at a lower cost. New Video VoIP Software, Webcams End That Pixelated Feeling\nSkype and Logitech team up to deliver video voice over Internet protocol calls that look more like TV than home videos\nThanks to the rapid-fire growth of broadband network connectivity, video voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) services now give callers around the world the ability to gab away for no more than the cost of their monthly Internet service provider fee. Until now, though, the video capabilities have been little more than a novelty that tempts callers with grainy images of their friends and family that lack the ability to capture their movement with any fluidity. But that could change as early as next month when Luxembourg–based Skype, a division of online auctioneer eBay, is set to unveil the latest version of its software, which is tuned to work with a new lineup of \"high-quality video\" Web cameras from Fremont, Calif.–based Logitech. The companies gave a preview Tuesday of what's to come at a New York City press conference, where they demonstrated their software and hardware working together to produce video VoIP that looks more like watching TV than grainy home movies. This is no small feat, as the laundry list of requirements indicates. What do you need to take advantage of this latest offering?\n\nThe growing demands of high definition digital video content, fixed content data, and compliance and security application will soon outstrip the capabilities of current storage technologies to keep up the demand. Clearly a new storage paradigm is needed to meet the growing storage demands. So what is it going to be?With its omnipresent computer, all connected via the internet, the information age has led to an explosion of information available to users. The decreasing cost of storing data and the increasing storage capability of the same small device footprint have been key enablers of this revolution. While current storage needs are being met, storage technology must continue to improve in order to keep pace with the rapidly increasing demand. So how is it going to be?Both magnetic and conventional optical data storage technologies, where individual bits are stored as distinct magnetic or optical changes on the surface of a recording medium are approaching physical limits beyond which individual bits may be too small or too difficult to store. So what next step is going to be?Storing information throughout the volume of a medium, not just on its surface is an intriguing solution to our entire problem regarding storage. So this is it, Holographic Data Storage. Holographic Data Storage is a volumetric approach which, although conceived decades ago, has made recent progress towards practicality with the appearance of lower-cost enabling technologies, significant results from longstanding research efforts and progress in holographic recording materials.This is a quest to find the answer to these entire questions, the technology and the story behind the next revolution in data storage. Advantages of HVD\n1. Resistance to damage - If some parts of the medium are damaged, all information can still be obtained from other parts. 2. Efficient retrieval - All information can be retrieved from any part of the medium. 3. These discs have the capacity to hold up to 3.9 terabyte (TB) of information, which is approximately 6,000 times the capacity of a CDROM, 830 times the capacity of a DVD, 160 times the capacity of single-layer Blu-ray-Discs, and about 48 times the capacity of standard computer hard drives. 4. The HVD also has a transfer rate of 1 gigabit\/s. 5. While reading a page the entire page of data can be retrieved quickly and at one time .\n\nMemory and storage are two terms that are regularly used to mean the same thing in computer technology. The reason for this is that some devices designed as memory also act as storage devices. There is however a distinction between the two terms. This article discusses the differences. Storage is where programs and other data can be stored permanently. It can also refer to temporary storage which is offered by devices normally meant for memory. Storage holds data and programs in such a way that it can be accessed by the processor through the computer memory. Storage includes hard disk drives and removable devices such as optical disks and memory cards. |Includes cache, primary and secondary memory||Includes storage devices such as optical disks, hard disks and memory cards|\n|Easy retrieval of data||Slower access than memory|\n|Computer will not run without it||Computer can be used even without it|\n|Upgradeable but expensive||Upgradeable and affordable|\n|Uses semiconductor chips||Uses magnetic disk technology, optical technology and semiconductor technology|\nMemory vs Storage\nSo what is the difference between memory and storage? Let’s find this out based on types, data access speeds, computer system dependence, cost and technology used. - Memory can refer to any device that stores data and instructions either temporarily or permanently for execution. It includes cache, primary and secondary memory. Storage on the other hand includes storage devices which store data and programs in a semi-permanent or permanent state. The stored data and programs can be accessed by the memory for processing. - Memory is quite fast. The access of data and instructions by the processor needs to be extremely fast to enable efficiency of the computer system. Access to data and programs in storage is relatively slow. This can be seen when you try to watch a DVD video using a computer. The computer will take a few seconds before it identifies the storage media (DVD), reads its contents and runs the appropriate program to enable video watching. - The computer system needs installed memory to run. The memory is the location where all data and instructions needed to execute a program are stored. The storage on the other hand is optional. - Memory can be upgraded by installing higher capacity chips. They are relatively expensive given that they use high speed technology. Upgrading storage is cheaper since storage devices use slower technology. - Memory mainly uses semiconductor chip technology. It’s quite fast but expensive. Storage on the other hand mainly uses magnetic and optical technology. However, emerging trends in storage are making used of solid state drives and semiconductor technology.\n\nIn an article published in the trade journal Optics Express, IBM has announced that it is developing technology that may replace current electronic chips in future computers. Rather than using electrical connections, which are prone to overheating and EMI problems, the company is planning to produce processors that use light to carry out calculations. Using micro-miniaturised Mach-Zehnder electro-optic modulators\n, IBM hopes to produce chips which are capable of running up to one hundred times faster than is currently possible with traditional CPUs, and some three times faster than the gains promised by recent research into 3D processors\nThe best news is yet to come: the new chips will do all this and consume somewhere in the region of a tenth\nthe power of current CPUs. Less power means less heat, which in turn means you can cram more horsepower into a smaller area without worrying about things melting down. You'll have a bit of a wait on your hands for the new light-based superchip, however: the head honcho of the project, Will Green, is predicting commercial availability “in the timeframe of 10 to 15 years. ” Initial batches of the chip have been earmarked by, surprise surprise, the high-tech branch of the Department of Defense - DARPA\n- who is partially funding the research project. To allow Will to blow his own trumpet for a moment: “Just like fibre optic networks have enabled the rapid expansion of the Internet by enabling users to exchange huge amounts of data from anywhere in the world, IBM's technology is bringing similar capabilities to the computer chip. While the research is clearly aimed at customers who need big-budget supercomputers, it'll be interesting to see how and when it trickles down to the retail level.

The long term aim is to boost processing speeds and data storage densities by several orders of magnitude and take the information technology industry into a new era, combining greatly improved performance with dramatically lower energy consumption. The phenomenon of “fast and slow” light arises from the dispersion of electromagnetic waves when they interact with, and travel through, a physical medium such as a crystal. This can have the effect of slowing down the light pulses, or on occasions appearing to cause local acceleration. These speed variations have the potential for developing purely optical devices using just electromagnetic radiation, rather than electrical signals, to store and process information. In the more immediate future, these properties will be used to enhance existing hybrid communication systems combining electronic and photonic (light-based) devices. But first more fundamental research is needed, and the current state of play along with a roadmap for future projects was discussed at a recent workshop organised by the European Science Foundation (ESF). The project achieved its main objectives of reviewing the state of the art, highlighting possible applications, and gathering a dispersed European community of scientists, according to the workshop’s convenor Marco Santagiustina. “There were two remarkable highlights: slow and fast light research has immense potential in applications like microwave and millimeter wave photonics, and secondly such applications can be targeted by making progress in a selected set of technologies,” said Santagiustina. Light signals are already used for communication over fibre optic cables, but cannot yet be stored directly, or used for computation. This would require slowing down the light signals so that they can be buffered within a small area, and can be achieved by exploiting “fast and slow” light effects. Before the arrival of true photonic computing, there is the more immediate prospect of building optical interconnects for example in communication networks, which would reduce latency, the time taken for signals to travel from source to destination. Latency imposed by the communications network has become a significant problem in an age of globalisation where computers in different continents are cooperating in tasks that need to be executed very quickly in fractions of a second. Another more immediate application of “fast and slow” light is likely to come from the ability in processing ultrawide band microwave signals, for radio communications, both for mobile telephony and wireless LANs. “Fast and slow” light can be harnessed to transmit radio frequencies directly over fibre, making it easier, cheaper, and more efficient to connect up base stations or wireless access points. “Radio over fiber is an existing application field destined to grow in the near future,” said Santagiustina. “This field will also represent a significant step forward for the photonic\/electronic convergence. In that area the time-delay\/phase-shift provided by slow and fast light devices can yield unprecedented functions.”\nSome of these functions have not yet been conceived, but the fundamental point is that converging photonics with electronics reduces delays and increases the bandwidth available, cutting costs and boosting communications capacity.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ce1a9862-3acc-47fe-a46f-5d9cba25c524>"]},{"passage":"Optical computing is an inherently multidisciplinary subject whose study routinely involves a spectrum of expertise that threads optical physics, materials science, optical engineering, electrical engineering, computer architecture, computer programming, and computer theory. Applying ideas from theoretical computer science, such as analysis of algorithms and computational complexity, enables us to place optical computing in a framework where we can try to answer a number of important questions. For example,which problems are optical computers suitable for solving? Also, how does the resource usage on optical computers compare with more standard (e.g. digital electronic) architectures? The physical principles behind some efficiencies in optical computing are outlined here. 1. Fan-in efficiency\nKirchoff’s Law is well understood in analog electronics as a natural and constant time means of summing the current at the intersection of an arbitrary number of wires. In optics, the same thing is possible by directing several light beams towards a point detector with a linear response to incident light. Such an optical arrangement sums n non-negative integers in O(1) addition steps. On a model of a sequential digital electronic computer this would require n − 1 addition operations and even many typical (bounded fan-in)parallel models, with n or more processors, take O(log n) time steps. Tasks that rely on scalar summation operations (such as matrix multiplication) would benefit greatly from an optical implementation of the scalar sum operation. Similarly, O(1) multiplication and O(1) convolution operations can be realised optically. Very recently, an optics-based digital signal processing platform has been marketed that claims digital processing speeds of tera (10^12) operations per second. 2. Efficiency in interconnection complexity\nAs optical pathways can cross in free space without measurable effect on the information in either channel, high interconnection densities are possible with optics. Architectures with highly parallel many-to-many interconnections between parallel surfaces have already been proposed for common tasks such as sorting. Currently, intrachip, inter-chip, and inter-board connections are being investigated for manufacturing feasibility. 3. Energy efficiency\nElectrical wires suffer from induced noise and heat, which increases dramatically whenever wires are made thinner or placed closer together, or whenever the data throughput is increased. As a direct consequence of their resistance free pathways and noise-reduced environments, optical systems have the potential to generate less waste heat and so consume less energy per computation step than electronic systems. This has beend emonstrated experimentally with general purpose digital optical processors.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ac456a32-9360-4961-be4b-8baafe289cc6>"]},{"passage":"Researchers at the Technische Universität Darmstadt in Germany have managed to stop light for up to one minute inside a crystal and store digitally-encoded information inside it.

Electronic components dissipate a large portion of energy as heat, whereas in photonics components losses are very limited.

EIT consists of firing a laser \"control beam\" at a crystal which contains ions of the element praseodymium. The laser triggers a quantum reaction in the crystal that has two contemporary effects. First, it makes this normally opaque crystal transparent over a narrow spectrum; and secondly, it changes the refractive index of the crystal dramatically, slowing the incoming light pulse down to a complete halt. At this point, the researchers fire a second laser beam (containing the information to be stored) at the crystal. At the precise moment in which the laser beam carrying the information is crossing the temporarily transparent crystal, the control beam is turned off, trapping light and information inside the now opaque crystal. The photons are converted into atomic spin excitations (or \"spin waves\"), which can be stored in the crystal until the control beam is fired again and the spin waves are turned back into light, which finally escapes the crystal. Scientists have used this technique in previous experiments, but they could only use it to store data for a few millionths of a second. This is because the spin wave is very delicate, subject to energy fluctuations that can corrupt the information it encodes. The TU Darmstadt team figured out how they could prolong this storage time significantly. Their approach was to develop an algorithm that senses the noise and applies magnetic fields and high-frequency pulses to the crystal to maintain the spin wave in its original state, so that the information is kept safe for as long as possible – up to a minute. \"In this first proof-of-principle experiment we focused on long storage times rather than on transfer rates,\" says Heinze. \"However, we showed that by image storage it is possible to increase the storage capacity of the memory, and this is very important feature for spatially multiplexed quantum memories.\" The researchers are now building on this result to try and store light for even longer periods of time (up to a week) in a more energy-efficient way while achieving higher data transfer rates.

This electro-optical device is a bridge between traditional electronic computing and the emerging field of optical computing, and it could lead to faster and more energy-efficient processors and memory in the future. “Computing at the speed of light has been an enticing but elusive prospect, but with this development, it’s now in tangible proximity,” Phys.org reports. Scientists have been trying to use light to transfer information extremely fast since the 1950s. However, there are practical limitations of how light can be used in this manner, especially when trying to integrate it along with electronic computing hardware. The problem is that electrical chips operate most efficiently when they are small in size, but optical chips benefit from being larger. This is because the wavelength of light is larger than that of electrons. The new device uses light which has been compressed into a small size, in a process called surface plasmon polariton. This allows optical chips to be integrated along with electrical chips because now the sizes are more comparable. The ability for devices to work in both electrical and optical domains, without the need for conversion, allows the creation of dual functionalities that can use both photons and electrons for processing. “This is a very promising path forward in computation and especially in fields where high processing efficiency is needed,” Nikolaos Farmakidis, graduate student and co-first author, said in a statement. There are many potential uses of this technology, but the current focus is on applications that require a large amount of processing power, such as artificial intelligence. The new device can improve on current technology like complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication of MOSFETs, which are the transistors that form the basis of many modern digital circuits. Co-author Nathan Youngblood explains the potential applications for the new nanoscale device: “This naturally includes artificial intelligence applications where on many occasions, the needs for high-performance, low-power computing far exceeds our current capabilities. It is believed that interfacing light-based photonic computing with its electrical counterpart is the key to the next chapter in CMOS technologies.”\nThe findings are published in the journal Science Advances.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:84cc7973-2b66-4130-8e98-d69e2e42381b>"]},{"passage":"Mobile communication for voice applications (e.g., cellular phone) is widely established throughout the world and witnesses a very rapid growth in all its dimensions including the increase in the number of subscribers of various cellular networks. An extension of this technology is the ability to send and receive data across various cellular networks using small devices such as smartphones. There can be numerous applications based on this technology; for example, video call or conferencing is one of the important applications that people prefer to use in place of existing voice (only) communications on mobile phones. Mobile computing–based applications are becoming very important and rapidly evolving with various technological advancements as it allows users to transmit data from remote locations to other remote or fixed locations. 1.9 Quantum Computing\nManufacturers of computing systems say that there is a limit for cram-ming more and more transistors into smaller and smaller spaces of inte-grated circuits (ICs) and thereby doubling the processing power about every 18 months.

An elec-tric current flows at only about 10% of the speed of light. This limits the rate at which data can be exchanged over long distances and is one of the factors that led to the evolution of optical fiber. By applying some of the advantages of visible and\/or IR networks at the device and component scale, a computer can be developed that can perform operations 10 or more times faster than a conventional electronic computer. Nanocomputing refers to computing systems that are constructed from nanoscale components. The silicon transistors in traditional computers may be replaced by transistors based on carbon nanotubes. The successful realization of nanocomputers relates to the scale and inte-gration of these nanotubes or components. The issues of scale relate to the dimensions of the components; they are, at most, a few nanometers in at least two dimensions. The issues of integration of the components are twofold: first, the manufacture of complex arbitrary patterns may be economically infeasible, and second, nanocomputers may include massive quantities of devices. Researchers are working on all these issues to bring nanocomputing a reality. 1.12 Network Computing\nAlmost all the computing paradigms that were discussed earlier are of this nature. Even in the future, if any one invents a totally new computing para-digm, it would be based on a networked architecture, without which it is impossible to realize the benefits for any end user. We are into a post-PC era, in which a greater number and a variety of com-puters and computing paradigms with different sizes and functions might be used everywhere and with every human being; so, the purpose of this chap-ter is to illustrate briefly the ideas of all these computing domains, as most of these are ubiquitous and pervasive in its access and working environment. • Mobile computing: Mobile computing consists of small processing elements (i.e., handheld devices) and the communication between various resources is by using wireless media (see Section 1.8). • Nanocomputing: Makes use of nanoscale components (see Section 1.11). 1.

Our technique is aimed at … building buffers for high-speed telecommunications.\" During the first phase of the project—which is part of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Defense Sciences Office slow-light program—Zhu says he learned that pulses could be stored and read out at a later time. The second phase was the actual experiment in which data pulses were stored (as acoustic waves in an optical fiber) and retrieved after a certain period of time. \"We really want to demonstrate that methods for storing optical information are much broader than people thought,\" Gauthier says. \"In the current telecommunication systems, you turn the optical signal into an electronic signal and store it in RAM. The optical data pulses are then regenerated by using the electrical signals to turn on and off an auxiliary laser source. But this process generates heat. The faster this is done, the more heat is generated.\" For this to work in the real world, the scientists say the communication fibers must be made of a material that provides an acoustic time frame long enough to allow the information to move from optical to sound, then return to optical. One option, Gauthier says, is to work with a new type of glass made from a chalcogenide, which has good semiconductor properties and contains one or more elements from the periodic table's chalcogenide group, also known as the \"oxygen family,\" which includes oxygen, sulfur, selenium and tellurium. Another option that researchers are exploring is to run the laser beams through a hollow optical fiber filled with gas (such as xenon), which would allow them to use a less powerful laser to induce longer lasting sound waves in the gas. This could potentially create a sound wave 50 times longer and allow the lasers used to be 100 times less powerful—and less energy intensive—thereby delivering more data more quickly at a lower cost.

Let’s find this out based on types, data access speeds, computer system dependence, cost and technology used. - Memory can refer to any device that stores data and instructions either temporarily or permanently for execution. It includes cache, primary and secondary memory. Storage on the other hand includes storage devices which store data and programs in a semi-permanent or permanent state. The stored data and programs can be accessed by the memory for processing. - Memory is quite fast. The access of data and instructions by the processor needs to be extremely fast to enable efficiency of the computer system. Access to data and programs in storage is relatively slow. This can be seen when you try to watch a DVD video using a computer. The computer will take a few seconds before it identifies the storage media (DVD), reads its contents and runs the appropriate program to enable video watching. - The computer system needs installed memory to run. The memory is the location where all data and instructions needed to execute a program are stored. The storage on the other hand is optional. - Memory can be upgraded by installing higher capacity chips. They are relatively expensive given that they use high speed technology. Upgrading storage is cheaper since storage devices use slower technology. - Memory mainly uses semiconductor chip technology. It’s quite fast but expensive. Storage on the other hand mainly uses magnetic and optical technology.

I would rather shape my soul than furnish it. There is no exercise that is either feeble or more strenuous, according to the nature of the mind concerned, than that of conversing with one’s own thoughts. The greatest men make it their vocation, “those for whom to live is to think. – Montaigne\n“Meditation,” here, is taken to mean “cerebration,” vigorous thinking — the same practice John Dewey addressed so eloquently a few centuries later in How We Think. This conflation, at first glance, seems rather antithetical to today’s notion of meditation — a practice often mistakenly interpreted by non-practitioners as non-thinking, an emptying of one’s mind, a cultivation of cognitive passivity. In reality, however, meditation requires an active, mindful presence, a bearing witness to one’s inner experience as it unfolds. In that regard, despite the semantic evolution of the word itself, Montaigne’s actual practice of meditation was very much aligned with the modern concept and thus centuries ahead of his time, as were a great deal of his views.\nThe great majority of men and women, in ordinary times, pass through life without ever contemplating or criticising, as a whole, either their own conditions or those of the world at large. They find themselves born into a certain place in society, and they accept what each day brings forth, without any effort of thought beyond what the immediate present requires…they seek the satisfaction of the needs of the moment, without much forethought, and without considering that by sufficient effort the whole condition of their lives could be changed…It is only a few rare and exceptional men who have that kind of love toward mankind at large that makes them unable to endure patiently the general mass of evil and suffering, regardless of any relation it may have to their own lives.

It is the more necessary to consider this question, in view of the fact that many men, under the influence of science or of practical affairs, are inclined to doubt whether philosophy is anything better than innocent but useless trifling, hair-splitting distinctions, and controversies on matters concerning which knowledge is impossible.\nThe value of philosophy is, in fact, to be sought largely in its very uncertainty. The man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense, from the habitual beliefs of his age or his nation, and from convictions which have grown up in his mind without the co-operation or consent of his deliberate reason. To such a man the world tends to become definite, finite, obvious; common objects rouse no questions, and unfamiliar possibilities are contemptuously rejected. As soon as we begin to philosophize, on the contrary, we find, as we saw in our opening chapters, that even the most everyday things lead to problems to which only very incomplete answers can be given. Philosophy, though unable to tell us with certainty what is the true answer to the doubts which it raises, is able to suggest many possibilities which enlarge our thoughts and free them from the tyranny of custom. Thus, while diminishing our feeling of certainty as to what things are, it greatly increases our knowledge as to what they may be; it removes the somewhat arrogant dogmatism of those who have never travelled into the region of liberating doubt, and it keeps alive our sense of wonder by showing familiar things in an unfamiliar aspect.\n“I’ve always tried to make a home for myself, but I have not felt at home in myself.

Consequently, philosophy enriches our personal growth, decision-making processes, and problem-solving capabilities, even without providing definitive answers.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: Why study Philosophy? 6 reasons of weight\nAt a time when everything must be valued according to the price that can be paid for it in the market, philosophy is increasingly cornered: it is forgotten and undervalued in the political reforms of education. Now, that does not mean that this training option has no value, on the contrary. Studying philosophy means learning skills that will hardly be developed in other disciplines. And is that There are plenty of reasons to study philosophy , shortly we learn about the nature of this source of knowledge. In the following lines we will see the most remarkable. - Related article: \"How are Psychology and Philosophy alike?\" Why study philosophy? This is a selection of those strengths that philosophy offers to those people who decide to learn from it. They are not ordered according to a certain criterion, but you can order them in your head, highlighting those that most appeal to you. If you're wondering why study philosophy , it will be very useful. 1. Offers a better scientific knowledge\nScience is a type of knowledge-gathering method that has proven to be incredibly valuable for centuries. Now, in practice, knowledge of science does not always imply interpreting the data that your research methods offer us. And is that many times we believe that scientific information is given by nature and convey an obvious meaning to anyone who knows, but this is not so. The philosophy of science it allows us to know if certain interpretations of data are adequate or not, if the research methods used allow us to draw the conclusions we want, or even if the hypotheses from which we start are defective. Thus, the training in philosophy is an excellent complement for science-based careers, on the one hand, and also allow for carving out a career as consultant science philosophers that can guide teams of researchers to review the approaches of their studies. 2. It is suitable for curious minds\nPhilosophy is the formative career par excellence for curious people, interested in the big questions about life and about existence . For example: what do we live for? What can we know? What exists and what does not? How should we behave to be good? In practice, the amount of questions of this type that philosophers can come to think is infinite and, although they do not usually reach conclusions that completely satisfy their initial curiosity, the hunger to know more and more leads them to organize their ideas in an increasingly sophisticated way . - Maybe you're interested: \"123 wise phrases to reflect on life\"\n3. It allows to develop constructive criticisms\nThe world moves more and more by the logic imposed by the market, and that is why it is good to maintain a perspoective distance from this system and raise criticisms of those relations and trade dynamics from which it is so difficult to escape. Philosophy was born just for this: to question the most widespread beliefs, those that dominate our minds so much that we do not even consider them beliefs, but absolute truths. In this way, studying philosophy provides a rational counterpoint that makes it possible to have a different mentality, able to detect anomalies where other people can not, and that therefore makes social change possible. - Maybe it interests you: \"Are we rational or emotional beings?\" 4. It can be applied to one's life\nMany of the questions posed by philosophy have personal implications. For example, the existential crisis is not the same if you already have an experience in this field , and the same happens with doubts about how to act correctly and what kind of behaviors should be avoided. In other words, philosophical activity does not take place outside personal life; They usually merge into one thing. 5. It helps us to reinterpret the world\nPhilosophy is not exactly a form of therapy, but it does allow you to reach stimulating reflections on their own experiences, the world, personal relationships and everything that surrounds us. So, it makes it easier for us to find alternative ways of interpretation, those that satisfy us more and allow us to be happy. In the end, given that we can never have a totally objective vision of reality, it is better to direct our subjectivity towards what brings us closer to happiness and well-being. 6. It allows detecting manipulation attempts\nThe analysis of discourses is one of the areas in which philosophy is most useful.\n\n- Inductive reasoning is a method of logical thinking wherein broad generalizations and theories are derived from specific examples and observations. - Deductive reasoning, on the other hand, is opposite of inductive reasoning. It is the method wherein specific ideas and conclusions are derived from general statements and hypotheses. - Metaphysics is the branch or type of philosophy that focuses on finding answers to questions about nature, reality, and the physical universe. - Axiology is the type or branch of philosophy that studies fundamental values and principles. - Epistemology is the branch or type of philosophy that scrutinizes how we, people, are able to learn and understand what we know. Why Do We Study Philosophy? Philosophy in life is extremely important. Why? It is because philosophy is like a way of life. It is a way of thinking, understanding, and gaining wisdom about human life, the reality, and the world. All of us are taught about philosophy at school because it is important to study about philosophy as we grow and become adults and as we fully embrace the reality of life. Here are 10 reasons why we study philosophy:\n1) To become a person of our own\nWith philosophy, we are able to think and become a person of our own. It enables us to not become just a “yes person”, who does not know how to think and decide for himself \/ herself. It gives us the ability to think critically, especially in real life situations. With this, philosophy also takes courage to be independent and decide for the self. 2) To get ready and succeed in various fields of expertise and careers\nWhen we study philosophy, we develop many essential skills such as reading, writing, speaking, reasoning, thinking, learning, adapting, communicating, and organizing. Now, these skills are very important in the real world, especially at the workplace where we need to perform and excel. Without these skills, we will be forever stuck and dependent on our families, especially our parents. 3) To realize your own understanding of what success is\nSuccess varies in different people and through philosophy, you will be able to realize and discover the meaning of success to you. Philosophy encourages you to think deeply, confront yourself, and know the answers, especially when it comes to questions about values, success, and fulfillment. 4) To be able to get great scores in standardized exams\nPhilosophy centers on critical, analytical, and logical thinking. Therefore, philosophy helps us figure out the correct answers in standardized tests like LSAT, GRE, MCAT, and GMAT. It is because these standardized exams are filled with philosophical questions and problems. 5) To grow and become a well informed citizen\nBeing an informed citizen does not only mean watching or reading the news everyday or surfing the web every hour. Being a well informed citizen means that beyond all the information overload that we are bombarded with everyday, we are able to think critically and behave according to what and why we know. 6) To have the potential to earn higher income\nPhilosophy stimulates the mind like no other field of study. This is the reason why so-called philosophers are very intelligent people full of wisdom. Now, when we study philosophy, we are able to develop our knowledge and wisdom to prepare for the real world of working and competition. We could have the potential to earn higher income through our learnings from philosophy. 7) To gain wisdom about ethical principles and their practice in real life\nThrough philosophy, we are able to learn about ethics, life, family, work, and social principles. With these ethical principles, we can be able to think and act ethically to various types of discussions, arguments, and situations. 8) To become a valuable and effective communicator\nPhilosophy teaches us the value of communication for personal and societal growth. When we study philosophy, our communication skills are also developed and enhanced. This further enables us to become excellent communicators who express our ideas, opinions, and theories effectively and intelligently. 9) To be able to determine our chosen path\nAnalytical thinking allows us to reflect on our deepest needs, desire, and passion. Philosophy helps us become analytical thinkers who are capable to know the best career path for ourselves so that we will not be wasting our time with the wrong choice or decision. 10) To get ready for a possible career in law\nSome of us want to partake in the world of law by becoming lawyers or attorneys.\n\nWhy Study Philosophy?Page address: https:\/\/www.mnsu.edu\/philosophy\/whystudy.html\nThe great virtue of philosophy is that it teaches not what to think, but how to think. It is the study of meaning, of the principles underlying conduct, thought and knowledge. The skills it hones are the ability to think critically and creatively, to question orthodoxies, and to express ideas clearly. While only a small proportion of philosophy majors go on to become professional philosophers, they flourish in a surprisingly diverse range of career fields. Philosophy has always been excellent training for the law, but it is equally useful for computer scientists. Philosophy majors have the highest acceptance rate to US medical schools, compared with all other majors. And more and more businesses recognize the valuable skills that philosophy majors bring to the workplace. Studying philosophy helps one become a truly independent thinker. And that is the ultimate transferable job skill.

A great many employers (see this and this) actively seek out students who have demonstrated abilities in such areas as communication, analytic thinking, and problem-solving areas that receive a great deal of attention in the philosophy classroom! Indeed, philosophy majors tend to be very competitive in areas such as law, business, and medicine:\n- Philosophy majors rank third highest on the LSAT. - Philosophy majors ranked the highest among majors on both the verbal section and the analytic section of the GRE in the period from 2001 to 2004. Among humanities and social science majors, philosophy majors ranked highest on the quantitative section as well. - According to\nThe Economist, \"philosophy students do better in examinations for business and management schools than anybody except mathematicians\", better even than those who study economics, business or other vocational subjects. - A recent study by the American Medical Association found that philosophy majors enjoyed the third highest acceptance rate into American medical schools. Philosophy majors address the fundamental questions by developing foundational cognitive skills. They learn to question the things most people take for granted and they learn how to go about pursuing the answers to those questions. In the words of a 1998 editorial from the Times of London, \"The great virtue of philosophy is that it teaches not what to think, but how to think.\" Because of this, a philosophical education is a valuable foundation for just about any career, and just about any sort of life. Many philosophy majors go into business (investment banking is a popular option). Many others go into law (including Justices Stephen Breyer and David Souter of the US Supreme Court). Some become novelists (Philip K. Dick, David Foster Wallace, Pearl S. Buck), artists (Robert Motherwell, Barnett Newman), film critics (Pauline Kael, Gene Siskel) or entertainers (Harrison Ford, David Duchovny, Steve Martin, Bruce Lee). Some become doctors, or study ethics and serve on advisory boards to hospitals. Some go into politics (Robert McNamara, William Bennett, Jerry Brown, Bill Clinton). Many teach: some in the public school system, others at the university level. And some,like Martin Luther King, fundamentally change the world we live in. The ancient Greek philosopher Socrates said, \"the unexamined life is not worth living.\" Perhaps living an unexamined life is the only thing a person with a degree in philosophy cannot do.\n\nIf any of my readers have any experience applying to graduate schools, I’m looking for advice and feedback on my statement of purpose. Highlighted sections are areas that I think may need some work. One of the things that I believe most firmly is that the world would benefit from having more philosophy. I am a philosophy student, and philosophy is an integral part of my life. I write a philosophy blog, I read philosophy books, and I attend philosophy discussion groups. It’s most pervasive influence however is that it has become the lens through which I view life. For though philosophy is, in a sense, in the metaphorical lens manufacturing business, I think in many ways the main benefit of philosophy is that you get a feel for the nature of the lenses themselves. To a certain extent philosophy helps us get outside of ourselves; something which I believe is invaluable, not just in academic study but also in our personal lives. I want philosophy to be my life’s work, but by this I do not just mean that I want to study philosophy academically – I am also interested in cultivating the philosophical mindset in society and government. I think the factor that has played the biggest role in my philosophical development is my interdisciplinary education at Quest University Canada. The philosophical courses that I took were excellent, but I think I got far more out of them then I otherwise would because they were situated in a broader context. My understanding of freewill was shaped by Kant and Dostoyevsky, but also by studies in molecular biology. My understanding of human nature was informed by Heidegger and evolutionary psychology. To learn about politics I’ve studied Plato, and I’ve also studied governmental systems and modern media theory. I have found that all of my studies’ have been mutually supportive, and that the most valuable contribution of philosophy is the critical mindset that it fosters. My opinion of the value of this mindset was reinforced to m by my experience working as a peer tutor at Quest. I edited papers from a wide variety of fields, including economics, ecology, biology, and many others. What I continuously found was that clarity of thought was the essential differentiating factor between good and bad papers, and that often the best way to help the other student was to try to draw them into a critical analysis of their own thoughts. My specific field of interest for academic study is ethics and phenomenology. My undergraduate thesis, On Humility, was a phenomenological theory of knowledge in which I propose that the way to be knowledgeable is to have an epistemically humble demeanour. In working on this project I increasingly found that my epistemological project was also inseparably an ethical one. I want to continue this line of research. Drawing on the works of philosophers such as Heidegger and Levinas, I want to explore the idea that the constitution of our phenomenal world is ultimately ethical. I think that we fundamentally experience the world as a normative question, and that our essential nature lies in perceiving and answering the question. Public policy is thoroughly intertwined with my philosophical interests, because work on policy is first and foremost an ethical project. I am inclined to think that all research is ultimately ethical in nature, but public policy is one of the fewer fields that studies ethics explicitly. The project of public policy, informed by many other fields of research, is to determine both how we think the world should be and how to change it to match our vision. I am interested in public policy because I have an ethical project, and I believe that I would be well served in a public policy program because of my philosophy and interdisciplinary background. In the end everything comes down to ethics. We must all struggle with the question of what we should do with our lives. I think that one of the most fascinating aspects of the question is that the question itself can also be a subject of study. What is the question? Are there right answers? Can we answer the question for others? It is, in a sense, the ultimate question of human existence. I have researched many different programs, and I have concluded that the London School of Economics MSC in philosophy and public policy would be an excellent fit for me. The program will allow me to continue my research on ethics in an interdisciplinary environment, while also providing me with the practical skills and the theoretical background to excel in many potential careers.\n\nor: Descartes says that Q. I find this claim plausible, for the following reasons. There are a variety of things a philosophy paper can aim to accomplish. It usually begins by putting some thesis or argument on the table for consideration. Then it goes on you feel for someone you thought you couldn't live, to do one or two of the following: Criticize that argument; or show that certain arguments for the thesis are no good Defend the argument or thesis against Pomodoro, Ltd. Research someone else's criticism Offer reasons to What should when love you thought you couldn't live, believe the Paper on Genetic, thesis Offer counter-examples to What you're for someone you couldn't without?, the thesis Contrast the strengths and Effectiveness of online, weaknesses of two opposing views about the thesis Give examples which help explain the thesis, or which help to make the thesis more plausible Argue that certain philosophers are committed to the thesis by their other views, though they do not come out and explicitly endorse the thesis Discuss what consequences the thesis would have, if it were true Revise the thesis, in the light of some objection. No matter which of these aims you set for yourself, you have to explicitly present reasons for the claims you make . Students often feel that since it's clear to them that some claim is true, it does not need much argument. But it's very easy to overestimate the strength of your own position. After all, you already accept it. You should assume that your audience does not already accept your position; and you should treat your paper as an attempt to persuade such an audience. Hence, don't start with assumptions which your opponents are sure to reject. Should You Feel When You're Losing For Someone You Thought! If you're to Sample Letter Letters, have any chance of persuading people, you have to start from common assumptions you all agree to. A good philosophy paper is modest and makes a small point ; but it makes that point clearly and straightforwardly, and it offers good reasons in support of it. People very often attempt to accomplish too much in a philosophy paper. The usual result of this is should you're losing for someone you thought you couldn't live a paper that's hard to read, and which is full of inadequately defended and poorly explained claims. Research On Genetic! So don't be over-ambitious. Don't try to establish any earth-shattering conclusions in your 5-6 page paper. Done properly, philosophy moves at a slow pace. The aim of these papers is for you to show that you understand the material and that you're able to think critically about it. Should When You're Losing You Couldn't Live! To do this, your paper does have to show some independent thinking. That doesn't mean you have to Research, come up with your own theory, or that you have to make a completely original contribution to What you feel you're losing love for someone you couldn't live without?, human thought. What You Feel You're Love For Someone You Thought Live! There will be plenty of time for What when you're losing love for someone you thought, that later on. Effectiveness Of Online Marketing Essay! An ideal paper will be clear and when losing for someone you couldn't live, straightforward (see below), will be accurate when it attributes views to other philosophers (see below), and marketing business essay, will contain thoughtful critical responses to What should you feel losing love you thought you couldn't without?, the texts we read. It need not always break completely new ground. But you should try to come up with your own arguments, or your own way of elaborating or criticizing or defending some argument we looked at in class. Writing Title! Merely summarizing what others have said won't be enough. It's even more valuable to talk to each other about what you want to What should you feel you're losing for someone live without?, argue in your paper. When you have your ideas worked out Research Engineering well enough that you can explain them to should when you're without?, someone else, verbally, then you're ready to sit down and of online essay, start making an outline. The overall clarity of What losing love you couldn't without? your paper will greatly depend on its structure. That is why it is important to think about these questions before you begin to write.\n\nThe profession of philosophy, largely under the leadership of the American Philosophical Association, has taken steps which, together with a pattern of a significant number of faculty approaching retirement, have gradually moved the market toward equilibrium between supply and demand of PhDs. Although the job market remains stringent for candidates, it is also becoming more difficult for employers to hire their top choices. Institutions that aspire to offer an undergraduate major in philosophy will find themselves in a stronger position to recruit better teachers. The value of philosophy graduate programs must be understood differently. At least three points should be added to what has already been said about philosophy programs: that teaching is not the only activity for which advanced philosophy training can prepare a person; that, in part for reasons indicated above, advanced work in philosophy is important to various non-philosophers, both in the academic world and outside it; and that MA programs in philosophy can effectively serve certain people preparing for a non-academic profession, such as law or public service. We must also emphasize that for many universities, graduate programs in philosophy \"pay their own way” by generating more tuition revenue to the university than it costs to pay for departmental salaries, stipends, and overhead. It is true, however, that because of the writing-intensive nature of many courses in philosophy, the faculty-student ratio is even more important than in many other disciplines. There are at least two other reasons for the value of philosophy graduate programs. They are needed in order to prepare the next generation of the professoriate in both research and teaching. Moreover, in philosophy, the relation between teaching and research is especially close, and reducing or eliminating a graduate program is very likely (in some cases certain) to weaken undergraduate teaching. It would almost certainly hinder research that supports undergraduate teaching. Philosophy is unlike many fields in that the content even of beginning courses is greatly affected by the instructor’s research. Controversial issues like the relation between mind and body come into introductory courses, and what a teacher has to say about the issues depends heavily on a grasp of sophisticated argumentation that may underlie—indeed, may be necessary for giving—a clear and simple presentation, even though it may never enter the class discussion. This observation implies no negative attitude toward any other field; the point is to emphasize that philosophical research supports and is often necessary for good teaching in philosophy, even at the lower levels. 6. Measures of Programmatic Success\nThe following remarks suggest ways in which the success of a philosophy program can be measured. One such internal measure is provided by an institution’s outcomes assessment policies and procedures. (The American Philosophical Associations’s statement on outcomes assessment can be found at its website: www.apaonline.org.) In this section we address two different issues. We begin by expressing some skepticism about overly simplistic quantitative measures. We then turn to the issue of success from the student’s point of view, in particular, how a background in philosophy contributes to a student’s employment prospects. Enrollments and Grants: Cautionary Remarks\nIt would be a mistake to assess the value of a philosophy program by its enrollment figures. Few students entering college have had much exposure to philosophy. The same is true of such disciplines as economics, anthropology, and sociology, but students can quickly see the practical application of these disciplines to the study of human behavior. Philosophy can seem initially to be more esoteric, especially in light of its invisibility in most secondary school curriculums in the United States. With the exception of church-affiliated institutions, which often require multiple philosophy courses of all students, very few colleges or universities have any formal philosophy course requirement. Students thus quite often enroll in a philosophy course simply to fulfill an institutional requirement or to sample an intriguing elective. Moreover, philosophy can be a demanding discipline. In most colleges and universities the number of biology majors exceeds the number of physics majors. One should not infer from that phenomenon that physics is therefore less central than biology. For these reasons the importance of a philosophy program to an institution’s academic mission is not apt to be measured accurately by total course enrollments or total number of majors.\n\nThus we have completed the circuit and returned to the conceptions of the first portion of this book: such as the biological continuity of human impulses and instincts with natural energies; the dependence of the growth of mind upon participation in conjoint activities having a common purpose; the influence of the physical environment through the uses made of it in the social medium; the necessity of utilization of individual variations in desire and thinking for a progressively developing society; the essential unity of method and subject matter; the intrinsic continuity of ends and means; the recognition of mind as thinking which perceives and tests the meanings of behavior. These conceptions are consistent with the philosophy which sees intelligence to be the purposive reorganization, through action, of the material of experience; and they are inconsistent with each of the dualistic philosophies mentioned. 2. The Nature of Philosophy\nOur further task is to extract and make explicit the idea of philosophy implicit in these considerations. We have already virtually described, though not defined, philosophy in terms of the problems with which it deals; and we have pointed out that these problems originate in the conflicts and difficulties of social life. The problems are such things as the relations of mind and matter; body and soul; humanity and physical nature; the individual and the social; theory - or knowing, and practice - or doing. The philosophical systems which formulate these problems record the main lineaments and difficulties of contemporary social practice. They bring to explicit consciousness what men have come to think, in virtue of the quality of their current experience, about nature, themselves, and the reality they conceive to include or to govern both. As we might expect, then, philosophy has generally been defined in ways which imply a certain totality, generality, and ultimateness of both subject matter and method. With respect to subject matter, philosophy is an attempt to comprehend - that is, to gather together the varied details of the world and of life into a single inclusive whole, which shall either be a unity, or, as in the dualistic systems, shall reduce the plural details to a small number of ultimate principles. On the side of the attitude of the philosopher and of those who accept his conclusions, there is the endeavor to attain as unified, consistent, and complete an outlook upon experience as is possible. This aspect is expressed in the word 'philosophy' - love of wisdom. Whenever philosophy has been taken seriously, it has always been assumed that it signified achieving a wisdom which would influence the conduct of life. Witness the fact that almost all ancient schools of philosophy were also organized ways of living, those who accepted their tenets being committed to certain distinctive modes of conduct; witness the intimate connection of philosophy with the theology of the Roman church in the middle ages, its frequent association with religious interests, and, at national crises, its association with political struggles. This direct and intimate connection of philosophy with an outlook upon life obviously differentiates philosophy from science. Particular facts and laws of science evidently influence conduct. They suggest things to do and not do, and provide means of execution. When science denotes not simply a report of the particular facts discovered about the world but a general attitude toward it - as distinct from special things to do - it merges into philosophy. For an underlying disposition represents an attitude not to this and that thing nor even to the aggregate of known things, but to the considerations which govern conduct. Hence philosophy cannot be defined simply from the side of subject matter. For this reason, the definition of such conceptions as generality, totality, and ultimateness is most readily reached from the side of the disposition toward the world which they connote. In any literal and quantitative sense, these terms do not apply to the subject matter of knowledge, for completeness and finality are out of the question. The very nature of experience as an ongoing, changing process forbids. In a less rigid sense, they apply to science rather than to philosophy. For obviously it is to mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, anthropology, history, etc. that we must go, not to philosophy, to find out the facts of the world. It is for the sciences to say what generalizations are tenable about the world and what they specifically are. But when we ask what sort of permanent disposition of action toward the world the scientific disclosures exact of us we are raising a philosophic question.\n\nPersonal philosophy statements can be fantastic in helping you focus on your goals and determining the steps necessary to achieve them. Developing a personal philosophy is an invaluable exercise that allows you to understand yourself better – both professionally and personally. You can create a roadmap to guide your actions and decisions by reflecting on your beliefs, values, and priorities. This article guides us into what personal philosophy entails and how to craft a great one. Meaning of “Personal Philosophy”\nAll the world’s greatest humanitarians, gurus, faiths, and charities have one. But what exactly is one’s philosophy, and how can it serve one? One’s philosophy encompasses all that a person values, believes in, and is motivated to live by. Its goal is to serve as a guidepost for your daily decisions and help you live according to your principles. Ultimately, your goals drive whatever endeavor you undertake or inspire you to pursue any specific action. How to Craft Great Personal Philosophy Statements\nPersonal worldviews change with a person’s development, education, and experience. As you go through life, you will always get a more nuanced view of the world and a simpler philosophy to guide your actions. So, without further ado, let’s get into some pointers to get you rolling. 1. Enhance Your Sense of Individuality\nThe first step in becoming who you want to be is accepting who you now are. Take a personality test or ask your friends about your strengths and weaknesses and what motivates you. Maintaining focus might be aided by writing down your ideas in a journal. Some people find that having a personal philosophy helps them remember who they are and what they’re capable of. You could be on a voyage of self-discovery, learning things about yourself that you didn’t know previously. Your philosophy statement can be improved by focusing on its intended purpose. 2. Determine Your Ideal Self and Stick to It\nPeople have different goals in life; some aim for grandeur, while others want to be left alone in peace. I’m curious as to your ultimate goal(s). Possibly, you know roughly what it is you want to do, but you need help figuring out how to get there. This is why it’s helpful to have your philosophy to use as a starting point. Answering the following questions will help you figure out what you want from this trip. When you think about your daily routine, what makes you most eager to get out of bed? - If you had to sum up your beliefs in one sentence, what would they be? - In what ways do you think it’s necessary to uphold specific values? - Which moral traits do you admire in other people? Your answers to these questions can serve as a roadmap for your life’s purpose. As such, the answers may shed light on how you envision your future self-relationship. 3. Create Your Statement of Philosophy\nLook at your notes from these exercises. See if you can see any recurring themes in terms of the values and characteristics that emerged. This could be seen as a fundamental moral tenet of your character. It could be overt, such as altering your self-talk or your expectations for the future, or it could be more subtle. Using the information you’ve obtained, try writing your personal philosophy statement while keeping the factors we’ve just discussed in mind. Your guiding philosophy should be concise and to the point. Don’t worry if this isn’t how it comes out at first. Changes can always be made. Developing a philosophy of life is a lifelong endeavor, and your beliefs and values will evolve as you do. There is always something to take away from any situation, no matter how dire it may seem. To grow, you need to broaden your horizons and be more accepting of the change. Ultimately, you are the total of your experiences. So, keep your development active by taking advantage of opportunities to live and learn. 4. Extending One’s Worldview and Life-Learnings\nYour quest to formulate a guiding philosophy has resulted in your actively seeking out those experiences that get you closer to realizing your goals. Consider engaging in some of these pursuits to help shape your unique philosophy. 5. Take in Some Literary Works\nBoth fictional and nonfictional books can teach you about the world, yourself, and your passions.\n\nPhilosophy makes me think philosophy courses give you more than just knowledge of the world they give you a deep understanding of how the my philosophy senior thesis was not only the best part of my lehigh experience, but it has helped me tremendously throughout law school and my life.

In the following lines we will see the most remarkable. - Related article: \"How are Psychology and Philosophy alike?\" Why study philosophy? This is a selection of those strengths that philosophy offers to those people who decide to learn from it. They are not ordered according to a certain criterion, but you can order them in your head, highlighting those that most appeal to you. If you're wondering why study philosophy , it will be very useful. 1. Offers a better scientific knowledge\nScience is a type of knowledge-gathering method that has proven to be incredibly valuable for centuries. Now, in practice, knowledge of science does not always imply interpreting the data that your research methods offer us. And is that many times we believe that scientific information is given by nature and convey an obvious meaning to anyone who knows, but this is not so. The philosophy of science it allows us to know if certain interpretations of data are adequate or not, if the research methods used allow us to draw the conclusions we want, or even if the hypotheses from which we start are defective. Thus, the training in philosophy is an excellent complement for science-based careers, on the one hand, and also allow for carving out a career as consultant science philosophers that can guide teams of researchers to review the approaches of their studies. 2. It is suitable for curious minds\nPhilosophy is the formative career par excellence for curious people, interested in the big questions about life and about existence . For example: what do we live for? What can we know? What exists and what does not? How should we behave to be good? In practice, the amount of questions of this type that philosophers can come to think is infinite and, although they do not usually reach conclusions that completely satisfy their initial curiosity, the hunger to know more and more leads them to organize their ideas in an increasingly sophisticated way . - Maybe you're interested: \"123 wise phrases to reflect on life\"\n3. It allows to develop constructive criticisms\nThe world moves more and more by the logic imposed by the market, and that is why it is good to maintain a perspoective distance from this system and raise criticisms of those relations and trade dynamics from which it is so difficult to escape. Philosophy was born just for this: to question the most widespread beliefs, those that dominate our minds so much that we do not even consider them beliefs, but absolute truths. In this way, studying philosophy provides a rational counterpoint that makes it possible to have a different mentality, able to detect anomalies where other people can not, and that therefore makes social change possible. - Maybe it interests you: \"Are we rational or emotional beings?\" 4. It can be applied to one's life\nMany of the questions posed by philosophy have personal implications. For example, the existential crisis is not the same if you already have an experience in this field , and the same happens with doubts about how to act correctly and what kind of behaviors should be avoided. In other words, philosophical activity does not take place outside personal life; They usually merge into one thing. 5. It helps us to reinterpret the world\nPhilosophy is not exactly a form of therapy, but it does allow you to reach stimulating reflections on their own experiences, the world, personal relationships and everything that surrounds us. So, it makes it easier for us to find alternative ways of interpretation, those that satisfy us more and allow us to be happy. In the end, given that we can never have a totally objective vision of reality, it is better to direct our subjectivity towards what brings us closer to happiness and well-being. 6. It allows detecting manipulation attempts\nThe analysis of discourses is one of the areas in which philosophy is most useful.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:81d92461-8427-44b0-89b9-d5f483d5f171>"]},{"passage":"- Inductive reasoning is a method of logical thinking wherein broad generalizations and theories are derived from specific examples and observations. - Deductive reasoning, on the other hand, is opposite of inductive reasoning.

Why Do We Study Philosophy? Philosophy in life is extremely important. Why? It is because philosophy is like a way of life. It is a way of thinking, understanding, and gaining wisdom about human life, the reality, and the world. All of us are taught about philosophy at school because it is important to study about philosophy as we grow and become adults and as we fully embrace the reality of life. Here are 10 reasons why we study philosophy:\n1) To become a person of our own\nWith philosophy, we are able to think and become a person of our own. It enables us to not become just a “yes person”, who does not know how to think and decide for himself \/ herself. It gives us the ability to think critically, especially in real life situations. With this, philosophy also takes courage to be independent and decide for the self. 2) To get ready and succeed in various fields of expertise and careers\nWhen we study philosophy, we develop many essential skills such as reading, writing, speaking, reasoning, thinking, learning, adapting, communicating, and organizing. Now, these skills are very important in the real world, especially at the workplace where we need to perform and excel. Without these skills, we will be forever stuck and dependent on our families, especially our parents. 3) To realize your own understanding of what success is\nSuccess varies in different people and through philosophy, you will be able to realize and discover the meaning of success to you. Philosophy encourages you to think deeply, confront yourself, and know the answers, especially when it comes to questions about values, success, and fulfillment. 4) To be able to get great scores in standardized exams\nPhilosophy centers on critical, analytical, and logical thinking. Therefore, philosophy helps us figure out the correct answers in standardized tests like LSAT, GRE, MCAT, and GMAT. It is because these standardized exams are filled with philosophical questions and problems. 5) To grow and become a well informed citizen\nBeing an informed citizen does not only mean watching or reading the news everyday or surfing the web every hour. Being a well informed citizen means that beyond all the information overload that we are bombarded with everyday, we are able to think critically and behave according to what and why we know. 6) To have the potential to earn higher income\nPhilosophy stimulates the mind like no other field of study. This is the reason why so-called philosophers are very intelligent people full of wisdom. Now, when we study philosophy, we are able to develop our knowledge and wisdom to prepare for the real world of working and competition. We could have the potential to earn higher income through our learnings from philosophy. 7) To gain wisdom about ethical principles and their practice in real life\nThrough philosophy, we are able to learn about ethics, life, family, work, and social principles. With these ethical principles, we can be able to think and act ethically to various types of discussions, arguments, and situations. 8) To become a valuable and effective communicator\nPhilosophy teaches us the value of communication for personal and societal growth. When we study philosophy, our communication skills are also developed and enhanced. This further enables us to become excellent communicators who express our ideas, opinions, and theories effectively and intelligently. 9) To be able to determine our chosen path\nAnalytical thinking allows us to reflect on our deepest needs, desire, and passion. Philosophy helps us become analytical thinkers who are capable to know the best career path for ourselves so that we will not be wasting our time with the wrong choice or decision. 10) To get ready for a possible career in law\nSome of us want to partake in the world of law by becoming lawyers or attorneys.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:5d930711-9b1f-42e7-afd1-08291e098a07>"]},{"passage":"Why Study Philosophy?Page address: https:\/\/www.mnsu.edu\/philosophy\/whystudy.html\nThe great virtue of philosophy is that it teaches not what to think, but how to think.

The skills it hones are the ability to think critically and creatively, to question orthodoxies, and to express ideas clearly. While only a small proportion of philosophy majors go on to become professional philosophers, they flourish in a surprisingly diverse range of career fields. Philosophy has always been excellent training for the law, but it is equally useful for computer scientists. Philosophy majors have the highest acceptance rate to US medical schools, compared with all other majors. And more and more businesses recognize the valuable skills that philosophy majors bring to the workplace. Studying philosophy helps one become a truly independent thinker.

A great many employers (see this and this) actively seek out students who have demonstrated abilities in such areas as communication, analytic thinking, and problem-solving areas that receive a great deal of attention in the philosophy classroom! Indeed, philosophy majors tend to be very competitive in areas such as law, business, and medicine:\n- Philosophy majors rank third highest on the LSAT. - Philosophy majors ranked the highest among majors on both the verbal section and the analytic section of the GRE in the period from 2001 to 2004.

Philosophy majors address the fundamental questions by developing foundational cognitive skills. They learn to question the things most people take for granted and they learn how to go about pursuing the answers to those questions. In the words of a 1998 editorial from the Times of London, \"The great virtue of philosophy is that it teaches not what to think, but how to think.\" Because of this, a philosophical education is a valuable foundation for just about any career, and just about any sort of life. Many philosophy majors go into business (investment banking is a popular option). Many others go into law (including Justices Stephen Breyer and David Souter of the US Supreme Court). Some become novelists (Philip K. Dick, David Foster Wallace, Pearl S. Buck), artists (Robert Motherwell, Barnett Newman), film critics (Pauline Kael, Gene Siskel) or entertainers (Harrison Ford, David Duchovny, Steve Martin, Bruce Lee). Some become doctors, or study ethics and serve on advisory boards to hospitals. Some go into politics (Robert McNamara, William Bennett, Jerry Brown, Bill Clinton). Many teach: some in the public school system, others at the university level. And some,like Martin Luther King, fundamentally change the world we live in. The ancient Greek philosopher Socrates said, \"the unexamined life is not worth living.\" Perhaps living an unexamined life is the only thing a person with a degree in philosophy cannot do.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e16035d4-733b-4c73-bedf-1554a5b3cdb0>"]},{"passage":"If any of my readers have any experience applying to graduate schools, I’m looking for advice and feedback on my statement of purpose. Highlighted sections are areas that I think may need some work. One of the things that I believe most firmly is that the world would benefit from having more philosophy. I am a philosophy student, and philosophy is an integral part of my life. I write a philosophy blog, I read philosophy books, and I attend philosophy discussion groups. It’s most pervasive influence however is that it has become the lens through which I view life. For though philosophy is, in a sense, in the metaphorical lens manufacturing business, I think in many ways the main benefit of philosophy is that you get a feel for the nature of the lenses themselves. To a certain extent philosophy helps us get outside of ourselves; something which I believe is invaluable, not just in academic study but also in our personal lives. I want philosophy to be my life’s work, but by this I do not just mean that I want to study philosophy academically – I am also interested in cultivating the philosophical mindset in society and government. I think the factor that has played the biggest role in my philosophical development is my interdisciplinary education at Quest University Canada. The philosophical courses that I took were excellent, but I think I got far more out of them then I otherwise would because they were situated in a broader context. My understanding of freewill was shaped by Kant and Dostoyevsky, but also by studies in molecular biology. My understanding of human nature was informed by Heidegger and evolutionary psychology. To learn about politics I’ve studied Plato, and I’ve also studied governmental systems and modern media theory. I have found that all of my studies’ have been mutually supportive, and that the most valuable contribution of philosophy is the critical mindset that it fosters. My opinion of the value of this mindset was reinforced to m by my experience working as a peer tutor at Quest. I edited papers from a wide variety of fields, including economics, ecology, biology, and many others. What I continuously found was that clarity of thought was the essential differentiating factor between good and bad papers, and that often the best way to help the other student was to try to draw them into a critical analysis of their own thoughts. My specific field of interest for academic study is ethics and phenomenology. My undergraduate thesis, On Humility, was a phenomenological theory of knowledge in which I propose that the way to be knowledgeable is to have an epistemically humble demeanour. In working on this project I increasingly found that my epistemological project was also inseparably an ethical one. I want to continue this line of research. Drawing on the works of philosophers such as Heidegger and Levinas, I want to explore the idea that the constitution of our phenomenal world is ultimately ethical. I think that we fundamentally experience the world as a normative question, and that our essential nature lies in perceiving and answering the question. Public policy is thoroughly intertwined with my philosophical interests, because work on policy is first and foremost an ethical project. I am inclined to think that all research is ultimately ethical in nature, but public policy is one of the fewer fields that studies ethics explicitly. The project of public policy, informed by many other fields of research, is to determine both how we think the world should be and how to change it to match our vision. I am interested in public policy because I have an ethical project, and I believe that I would be well served in a public policy program because of my philosophy and interdisciplinary background. In the end everything comes down to ethics. We must all struggle with the question of what we should do with our lives. I think that one of the most fascinating aspects of the question is that the question itself can also be a subject of study. What is the question? Are there right answers? Can we answer the question for others? It is, in a sense, the ultimate question of human existence. I have researched many different programs, and I have concluded that the London School of Economics MSC in philosophy and public policy would be an excellent fit for me. The program will allow me to continue my research on ethics in an interdisciplinary environment, while also providing me with the practical skills and the theoretical background to excel in many potential careers.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:10fc25c4-382f-4798-a7a5-7c19eac61f05>"]},{"passage":"or: Descartes says that Q.

Although the job market remains stringent for candidates, it is also becoming more difficult for employers to hire their top choices. Institutions that aspire to offer an undergraduate major in philosophy will find themselves in a stronger position to recruit better teachers. The value of philosophy graduate programs must be understood differently. At least three points should be added to what has already been said about philosophy programs: that teaching is not the only activity for which advanced philosophy training can prepare a person; that, in part for reasons indicated above, advanced work in philosophy is important to various non-philosophers, both in the academic world and outside it; and that MA programs in philosophy can effectively serve certain people preparing for a non-academic profession, such as law or public service. We must also emphasize that for many universities, graduate programs in philosophy \"pay their own way” by generating more tuition revenue to the university than it costs to pay for departmental salaries, stipends, and overhead. It is true, however, that because of the writing-intensive nature of many courses in philosophy, the faculty-student ratio is even more important than in many other disciplines. There are at least two other reasons for the value of philosophy graduate programs. They are needed in order to prepare the next generation of the professoriate in both research and teaching. Moreover, in philosophy, the relation between teaching and research is especially close, and reducing or eliminating a graduate program is very likely (in some cases certain) to weaken undergraduate teaching. It would almost certainly hinder research that supports undergraduate teaching. Philosophy is unlike many fields in that the content even of beginning courses is greatly affected by the instructor’s research. Controversial issues like the relation between mind and body come into introductory courses, and what a teacher has to say about the issues depends heavily on a grasp of sophisticated argumentation that may underlie—indeed, may be necessary for giving—a clear and simple presentation, even though it may never enter the class discussion. This observation implies no negative attitude toward any other field; the point is to emphasize that philosophical research supports and is often necessary for good teaching in philosophy, even at the lower levels. 6. Measures of Programmatic Success\nThe following remarks suggest ways in which the success of a philosophy program can be measured. One such internal measure is provided by an institution’s outcomes assessment policies and procedures. (The American Philosophical Associations’s statement on outcomes assessment can be found at its website: www.apaonline.org.) In this section we address two different issues. We begin by expressing some skepticism about overly simplistic quantitative measures. We then turn to the issue of success from the student’s point of view, in particular, how a background in philosophy contributes to a student’s employment prospects. Enrollments and Grants: Cautionary Remarks\nIt would be a mistake to assess the value of a philosophy program by its enrollment figures. Few students entering college have had much exposure to philosophy. The same is true of such disciplines as economics, anthropology, and sociology, but students can quickly see the practical application of these disciplines to the study of human behavior. Philosophy can seem initially to be more esoteric, especially in light of its invisibility in most secondary school curriculums in the United States. With the exception of church-affiliated institutions, which often require multiple philosophy courses of all students, very few colleges or universities have any formal philosophy course requirement. Students thus quite often enroll in a philosophy course simply to fulfill an institutional requirement or to sample an intriguing elective. Moreover, philosophy can be a demanding discipline. In most colleges and universities the number of biology majors exceeds the number of physics majors. One should not infer from that phenomenon that physics is therefore less central than biology. For these reasons the importance of a philosophy program to an institution’s academic mission is not apt to be measured accurately by total course enrollments or total number of majors.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ea680cee-f35b-4066-8bde-6c41186c4d9b>"]},{"passage":"Thus we have completed the circuit and returned to the conceptions of the first portion of this book: such as the biological continuity of human impulses and instincts with natural energies; the dependence of the growth of mind upon participation in conjoint activities having a common purpose; the influence of the physical environment through the uses made of it in the social medium; the necessity of utilization of individual variations in desire and thinking for a progressively developing society; the essential unity of method and subject matter; the intrinsic continuity of ends and means; the recognition of mind as thinking which perceives and tests the meanings of behavior. These conceptions are consistent with the philosophy which sees intelligence to be the purposive reorganization, through action, of the material of experience; and they are inconsistent with each of the dualistic philosophies mentioned. 2. The Nature of Philosophy\nOur further task is to extract and make explicit the idea of philosophy implicit in these considerations. We have already virtually described, though not defined, philosophy in terms of the problems with which it deals; and we have pointed out that these problems originate in the conflicts and difficulties of social life. The problems are such things as the relations of mind and matter; body and soul; humanity and physical nature; the individual and the social; theory - or knowing, and practice - or doing. The philosophical systems which formulate these problems record the main lineaments and difficulties of contemporary social practice. They bring to explicit consciousness what men have come to think, in virtue of the quality of their current experience, about nature, themselves, and the reality they conceive to include or to govern both. As we might expect, then, philosophy has generally been defined in ways which imply a certain totality, generality, and ultimateness of both subject matter and method. With respect to subject matter, philosophy is an attempt to comprehend - that is, to gather together the varied details of the world and of life into a single inclusive whole, which shall either be a unity, or, as in the dualistic systems, shall reduce the plural details to a small number of ultimate principles. On the side of the attitude of the philosopher and of those who accept his conclusions, there is the endeavor to attain as unified, consistent, and complete an outlook upon experience as is possible. This aspect is expressed in the word 'philosophy' - love of wisdom. Whenever philosophy has been taken seriously, it has always been assumed that it signified achieving a wisdom which would influence the conduct of life. Witness the fact that almost all ancient schools of philosophy were also organized ways of living, those who accepted their tenets being committed to certain distinctive modes of conduct; witness the intimate connection of philosophy with the theology of the Roman church in the middle ages, its frequent association with religious interests, and, at national crises, its association with political struggles. This direct and intimate connection of philosophy with an outlook upon life obviously differentiates philosophy from science. Particular facts and laws of science evidently influence conduct. They suggest things to do and not do, and provide means of execution. When science denotes not simply a report of the particular facts discovered about the world but a general attitude toward it - as distinct from special things to do - it merges into philosophy. For an underlying disposition represents an attitude not to this and that thing nor even to the aggregate of known things, but to the considerations which govern conduct. Hence philosophy cannot be defined simply from the side of subject matter. For this reason, the definition of such conceptions as generality, totality, and ultimateness is most readily reached from the side of the disposition toward the world which they connote. In any literal and quantitative sense, these terms do not apply to the subject matter of knowledge, for completeness and finality are out of the question. The very nature of experience as an ongoing, changing process forbids. In a less rigid sense, they apply to science rather than to philosophy. For obviously it is to mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, anthropology, history, etc. that we must go, not to philosophy, to find out the facts of the world. It is for the sciences to say what generalizations are tenable about the world and what they specifically are. But when we ask what sort of permanent disposition of action toward the world the scientific disclosures exact of us we are raising a philosophic question.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:83a754ea-6d83-4f74-af5b-10156a6bed1b>"]},{"passage":"Personal philosophy statements can be fantastic in helping you focus on your goals and determining the steps necessary to achieve them. Developing a personal philosophy is an invaluable exercise that allows you to understand yourself better – both professionally and personally. You can create a roadmap to guide your actions and decisions by reflecting on your beliefs, values, and priorities. This article guides us into what personal philosophy entails and how to craft a great one. Meaning of “Personal Philosophy”\nAll the world’s greatest humanitarians, gurus, faiths, and charities have one. But what exactly is one’s philosophy, and how can it serve one? One’s philosophy encompasses all that a person values, believes in, and is motivated to live by. Its goal is to serve as a guidepost for your daily decisions and help you live according to your principles. Ultimately, your goals drive whatever endeavor you undertake or inspire you to pursue any specific action. How to Craft Great Personal Philosophy Statements\nPersonal worldviews change with a person’s development, education, and experience. As you go through life, you will always get a more nuanced view of the world and a simpler philosophy to guide your actions. So, without further ado, let’s get into some pointers to get you rolling. 1. Enhance Your Sense of Individuality\nThe first step in becoming who you want to be is accepting who you now are. Take a personality test or ask your friends about your strengths and weaknesses and what motivates you. Maintaining focus might be aided by writing down your ideas in a journal. Some people find that having a personal philosophy helps them remember who they are and what they’re capable of. You could be on a voyage of self-discovery, learning things about yourself that you didn’t know previously. Your philosophy statement can be improved by focusing on its intended purpose. 2. Determine Your Ideal Self and Stick to It\nPeople have different goals in life; some aim for grandeur, while others want to be left alone in peace. I’m curious as to your ultimate goal(s). Possibly, you know roughly what it is you want to do, but you need help figuring out how to get there. This is why it’s helpful to have your philosophy to use as a starting point. Answering the following questions will help you figure out what you want from this trip. When you think about your daily routine, what makes you most eager to get out of bed? - If you had to sum up your beliefs in one sentence, what would they be? - In what ways do you think it’s necessary to uphold specific values? - Which moral traits do you admire in other people? Your answers to these questions can serve as a roadmap for your life’s purpose. As such, the answers may shed light on how you envision your future self-relationship. 3. Create Your Statement of Philosophy\nLook at your notes from these exercises. See if you can see any recurring themes in terms of the values and characteristics that emerged. This could be seen as a fundamental moral tenet of your character. It could be overt, such as altering your self-talk or your expectations for the future, or it could be more subtle. Using the information you’ve obtained, try writing your personal philosophy statement while keeping the factors we’ve just discussed in mind. Your guiding philosophy should be concise and to the point. Don’t worry if this isn’t how it comes out at first. Changes can always be made. Developing a philosophy of life is a lifelong endeavor, and your beliefs and values will evolve as you do. There is always something to take away from any situation, no matter how dire it may seem. To grow, you need to broaden your horizons and be more accepting of the change. Ultimately, you are the total of your experiences. So, keep your development active by taking advantage of opportunities to live and learn. 4. Extending One’s Worldview and Life-Learnings\nYour quest to formulate a guiding philosophy has resulted in your actively seeking out those experiences that get you closer to realizing your goals. Consider engaging in some of these pursuits to help shape your unique philosophy. 5. Take in Some Literary Works\nBoth fictional and nonfictional books can teach you about the world, yourself, and your passions.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e6c44055-a58b-47b8-a5a0-860c2ce13122>"]},{"passage":"Philosophy makes me think philosophy courses give you more than just knowledge of the world they give you a deep understanding of how the my philosophy senior thesis was not only the best part of my lehigh experience, but it has helped me tremendously throughout law school and my life.

Complete details on the CDL General Qualifications can be found here\n\nThe FMCSA is looking for comments on the training, qualification and safety issues that should be considered for this second pilot program. It is specifically looking for available safety data on 18- to 20-year-old drivers who operate commercial vehicles in intrastate commerce, where drivers this age are currently allowed to operate. This is an effort years in the making. The FMCSA said it was petitioned to consider this change as far back as October 2, 2000 when the Truckload Carriers Association asked the agency to consider such a pilot. The FMCSA held a public comment period the next year and received 1,600 comments, with 90% of them opposed to the idea on the basis younger drivers lack the maturity for the job, the agency explained in its Federal Register posting. \"None explained how interstate drivers under 21 would diminish safety when most States have concluded that intrastate drivers under 21 do not do so,\" FMCSA said of the 2001 comments. \"Very few truck drivers and motor carriers commented, but most of them also opposed the pilot program.\" The petition was denied in 2003.\n\nAge: You must be at least 18 years old to obtain a Class A CDL, but you cannot engage in interstate commerce until you are at least 21 years old. 2. Driver's License: You must have a valid driver's license and a good driving record. 3. Medical Certification: You must provide a valid medical certificate that meets the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) medical standards. 4. Knowledge Tests: You must pass the general knowledge test and any applicable endorsement tests, such as air brakes and combination vehicles. 5. Commercial Learner's Permit (CLP): You must obtain a Commercial Learner's Permit (CLP) by passing the knowledge tests. 6. Training: You must complete behind-the-wheel training with a qualified instructor or employer, and practice driving with your CLP under the supervision of a licensed CDL holder. 7. Skills Test: You must pass a three-part skills test that includes pre-trip inspection, basic control skills, and an on-road driving test. 8. Fees: You must pay the required fees to obtain your Class A CDL license. It is important to note that additional requirements may apply depending on the type of commercial vehicle you plan to operate, such as endorsements for hazardous materials or passenger transport. It is important to note that some employers may have additional age requirements for their drivers, so it is important to check with potential employers to determine their specific hiring criteria. In Oregon, the following endorsements are available for Class A CDL holders:\n1. T - Double\/Triple Trailers: To pull double or triple trailers. 2. P - Passenger: To transport passengers in a commercial vehicle. 3. N - Tank Vehicle: To transport liquids or gases in bulk containers. 4. H - Hazardous Materials: To transport hazardous materials as defined by federal regulations. 5. X - Combination of Tank Vehicle and Hazardous Materials: To transport both hazardous materials and liquids or gases in bulk containers. If you plan to operate a commercial vehicle that requires any of these endorsements, you will need to pass additional knowledge tests and meet other requirements, such as background checks and fingerprinting. 1. Pre-Trip Vehicle Inspection: You will be asked to perform a thorough inspection of your vehicle to ensure that it is safe to operate. This includes checking the brakes, steering, lights, tires, and other components. 2. Basic Vehicle Control: You will be asked to demonstrate your ability to control your vehicle in a variety of situations, such as backing up, turning, and maneuvering through a course. 3. On-Road Driving: You will be asked to drive your vehicle on public roads while demonstrating your ability to follow traffic laws, merge safely onto highways, change lanes, and make turns. Each part of the test is designed to evaluate your knowledge and skills related to operating a commercial vehicle safely and effectively. It is important to practice and prepare for the test by studying the Oregon Commercial Driver Manual and getting hands-on experience with a qualified instructor or mentor. 1. Air Brake Restriction: If you have not passed the air brake knowledge test and skills test, you will have an \"L\" restriction on your license, which means you are not authorized to drive a commercial vehicle with air brakes. 2. Intrastate Only Restriction: If you do not meet the federal medical requirements or do not self-certify to operate in interstate commerce, you will have an \"O\" restriction on your license, which means you are only authorized to operate commercial vehicles within Oregon. 3. Automatic Transmission Restriction: If you take your skills test in a vehicle with an automatic transmission, you will have an \"E\" restriction on your license, which means you are not authorized to drive a commercial vehicle with a manual transmission. 4. Other restrictions: Depending on your driving history or other factors, you may have additional restrictions on your license, such as a restriction that limits you to driving during daylight hours or prohibits you from driving certain types of vehicles. It is important to understand and comply with any restrictions or limitations on your CDL license to avoid penalties or other consequences. However, it's important to note that the skills test and the pre-trip inspection test must be taken in English. This is because the CDL skills test requires clear communication between the examiner and the driver, and the pre-trip inspection test involves identifying and describing various components of a commercial vehicle using standard English terminology.\n\nCommercial driving license CDL refers to a driver’s license that is used to operate commercial vehicles without any trouble. It is necessary to have a commercial driving license for those who want to drive commercial vehicles or vehicles used for transportation. The CDL is used to operate heavy and large vehicles, vehicles to transport hazardous material, and other commercial vehicles. Commercial vehicles include trucks, buses, and trailers. Driving a commercial vehicle is a huge responsibility so a truck driver or a trailer driver must have a Commercial Truck License for smooth business operations. Types of Commercial Licenses\nCommercial driving licenses include Class A, Class B, and Class C licenses. To get any of the mentioned licenses, you need to pass a test to showcase your driving knowledge, road sense, and specific driving skills. For few drivers, it is highly recommended to have a training from training school to avoid road conditions and accidents\nClass A Commercial Driving License\nClass A driving license is to operate any commercial vehicle with another vehicle like a trailer that weighs more than 26000 pounds. Drivers having a Class A driving license can drive tractor-trailers, 18-wheelers, semi or big rigs, a combination of trucks and trailers, livestock carriers, flatbeds, vehicles related to Class B and Class C, and tanker vehicles. Class B Commercial Driving License\nClass B driving license is to operate any single commercial vehicle (not attached to a trailer) that weighs more than 26000 pounds. Drivers having Class B driving licenses can drive straight trucks, delivery trucks like furniture trucks, box trucks, large buses, tourist buses, school buses, dump trucks with small trailers. They can also drive Class C vehicles. Class C Commercial Driving License\nClass B driving license is to operate any single commercial vehicle (not attached to a trailer) that weighs less than 26000 pounds. Drivers having Class C driving licenses can drive double trailers, triple trailers, passenger vans, buses, tanks, and other similar vehicles. How to Get a Commercial Driving License? Check for the minimum age requirement before you apply for the commercial driving license. The minimum age requirement varies from state to state. Some states allow applying for a commercial driving license between the ages of 18 to 21. However, some states require a minimum age of 21 years. A single state commercial driving license allows a driver to operate the commercial vehicle within the boundaries of the state of the residence of the drive. There are strict rules and guidelines to obtain a commercial driving license and each state has its regulations and requirements. To get a commercial driving license, you must pass a written knowledge test and a driving skills test, which is designed and conducted by the state itself. - Fulfill the minimum age requirement according to your residential state. - Think about the license type that you want to have. If you need a Class A or Class B driving license, you must complete driving training from an approved training provider or a training school. - Check for the application process and required documents you need to submit with your application. - Complete your application form. Attach all required documents and submit to the concerned office for further proceedings. - Submit your identity and social security number verifications as per the requirements by your state. - Show proof of your residence and proof of the state. - Plan your medical examination from an authorized doctor, laboratory, hospital, or clinic. Submit your complete medical examination report. Make sure to get a certificate that proves that the laboratory or hospital is certified to conduct a medical examination. - Pass the vision test to prove that you can see properly. - Pass a knowledge exam that will prove that you know the basics of driving and know the road signs and other important information. - Now wait for a few days and then schedule your driving test on the road. - Passing a pre-trip inspection is necessary. - Bring your commercial vehicle to pass the road skill test and driving test. - Once you have passed and cleared all exams and tests, pay the necessary fee to get your Commercial Driving License. - If you already have a driving license from one state and want to apply for a driving license of a second state, you must submit the driving record of at least 10 years along with your application.\n\nFMCSA May Eliminate Driving Experience Criterion in Vision Exemption Process\nA proposed rule from the agency offers two options: driving with a stable vision condition for at least a year or no specific amount of CMV driving experience required. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration is planning to change the eligibility requirements for someone seeking an exemption to operate a commercial motor vehicle without meeting the vision standards. Currently, and since 1998, the requirement has been three years of intrastate CMV driving experience immediately prior to the application date. There are other requirements, including being at least 21 years old, holding a valid license, and no license suspensions or convictions for serious traffic violations while operating any motor vehicle, even a personal vehicle. FMCSA has published a proposed rule Dec. 18 that offers two options: driving with a stable vision condition for at least a year or no specific amount of CMV driving experience required. Eliminating the experience requirement would be consistent with FMCSA’s diabetes exemption program, according to the rule. The criterion covering involvement in a crash, where the driver was cited for a moving violation or his\/her actions were a contributing factor in the crash, also is being tweaked by this rule. FMCSA states that it plans to use this definition of \"accident\" from 49 CFR 390.5 as being synonymous with \"crash\": \"An occurrence involving a CMV operating on a highway in interstate or intrastate commerce which results in:\n- \"A fatality;\n- \"Bodily injury to a person who, as a result of the injury, receives immediate medical treatment away from the scene of the accident; or\n- \"One or more vehicles incurring disabling damage as a result of the accident, requiring the motor vehicle(s) to be transported away from the scene by a tow truck or other motor vehicle.\" FMCSA is accepting comments on the proposed rule (www.regulations.gov, Docket No. FMCSA-2013-0097) for 30 days.\n\nThese requirements apply to both interstate and intrastate operations whose drivers are subject to the commercial driver’s license requirements found in Part 383 of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. The drug and alcohol testing requirements are very extensive, as you will see on the following pages. For that reason, we would suggest that small carriers join a drug and alcohol testing program and\/or consortium. Such programs\/consortiums will usually provide all necessary materials and help to ensure compliance. |Table 3.1: REQUIRED TESTS FOR DRUGS & ALCOHOL|\n|Drug Tests||Pre-Employment, Post-Accident, Random, Reasonable Suspicion, Return-to-Duty, and Follow-Up.|\n|Alcohol Tests||Post-Accident, Random, Reasonable Suspicion, Return-to-Duty, and Follow-Up.|\n\nTruck Driver Shortage Prompts Pilot Program to Test Teen Commercial Drivers on Public Roads\nThe trucking industry has become known for its aggressive lobbying tactics, and for supporting regulatory rollbacks and new rules that allow commercial trucking operators to increase profits at the expense of public safety. This includes recent amendments to drop testing of commercial drivers with conditions like sleep apnea (which makes them more likely to crash), and efforts to pass laws that increase vehicle weight limits, terminate certain Hours-of-Service requirements regarding mandatory driver rest breaks, and reduce the federal age limit for commercial drivers from 21 to 18. With a recent announcement from federal regulators, younger truckers may soon be a common site on our roads. This month, officials from the DOT’s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) announced that they are preparing to launch a pilot program that would test out teen commercial drivers on public roads. Here are few important details about what it involves:\n- Under the FMCSA’s pilot program, drivers between 18 and 20 will be able to drive commercial trucks and vehicles across state lines. Currently, only drivers 21 and older can operate trucks for interstate commerce. - Only drivers who have military experience and training in certain occupational specialists will be allowed to participate in the program. - The pilot program will include policies that require young drivers to complete a 240-hour apprentice driving program where they may only drive with veteran CDL holders and may not exceed 65 mph. - The program is intended to roll out later this year. The announcement has received a great deal of attention, in part because proposed laws to reduce the federal commercial driver age limit have long been supported by the trucking industry since the start of a chronic shortage. In fact, reducing the age limit has been one of the industry’s top solutions for addressing the trucker shortage problem, which is expected to reach nearly 65,000 drivers this year. That’s equal to roughly one commercial tractor-trailer per every 12 cargo loads, the lowest ratio in 15 years. While it may seem like a reasonable solution to the commercial trucking operators and companies that want to keep up with a rising demand for transportation of consumer goods, the proposed age limit reduction has faced harsh scrutiny from public safety advocates who argue that it puts the public at risk while allowing major corporations to profit from cheap labor. Additionally, they cite statistics like those from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which show that teen drivers are approximately 3 times more likely to fatally crash than drivers who are 20 or older. In response to these arguments, proponents and the trucking industry have pointed to the safety apprentice driving policy requiring young drivers to first train with more experienced drivers. They also commonly argue that 18-year-olds are currently allowed to operate commercial vehicles, though within state borders, in many states across the country. Trucking Regulations & Public Safety\nAs a personal injury and workers’ compensation law firm that fights for victims across Chicago and the state of Illinois, our legal team at Leonard Law Group knows how crucially important trucking regulations are to protecting the public and ensuring commercial operators take the necessary steps to reduce risks of serious truck accidents. Over the years, we’ve represented many victims of truck accidents, including drivers of passenger vehicles hit by truckers and truck drivers themselves, and are well aware of the devastating and often life-altering damage these massive machines can cause. Because commercial trucks pose such overwhelming dangers on our roads, we know it is important for advocates, lawmakers, and the public to keep apprised of trucking industry efforts fueled by money and potential profits rather than any concern for public safety. Just because the status quo may allow teens to get behind the wheel of trucks in some states doesn’t mean it should be preserved and strengthened across the board. That’s what many safety advocates will continue to focus on as they track the new pilot program and prepare to fight efforts for implementing the regulatory change nationwide. Fighting for Truck Accident Victims\nAlthough trucking regulations have been prone to change, there are still numerous laws that apply to trucking operators and drivers and make them responsible for taking appropriate safety measures.\n\nHow to Get a Commercial Drivers License in Indiana\nAll drivers must possess a CDL in Indiana in order to operate a commercial motor vehicle (CMV) in the state. The Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) can issue a commercial drivers license to any driver that meets the state’s eligibility requirements and passes the state’s testing criteria. Applicants for a commercial license must be of a certain age, pass the necessary medical screening, be able to prove lawful presence in the U.S., and more, in order to be found eligible. Applications for a CDL license in Indiana must be submitted in person, to a BMV licensing agency. All drivers must apply for – and receive – their commercial permits before they will be allowed to apply for their full commercial licenses. Some drivers are exempt from needing to meet all of the state’s typical licensing requirements, like military personnel and some farmers. Drivers must complete knowledge exams and driving skills tests using a vehicle of the class and type that they will be licensed to operate. Several endorsements can be added to a license for drivers who meet the requirements. CDL Requirements in Indiana\nCDL requirements for drivers in Indiana include being at least 18 years of age at the time of submitting the application, if applying for an intrastate permit, or 21 years of age, if applying for an interstate license. Other CDL license requirements include:\n- Holding a valid IN driver’s license for at least one year before application. - Having a valid U.S. Social Security Number (SSN). - Passing the DOT medical exam (if applicable). - Passing the written CDL test. - Obtaining a learner’s permit. - Passing a driving skills test. How to Apply for a CDL Permit in Indiana\nAll Indiana drivers must first apply for – and receive – the CDL permit, or CLP, before they can be found eligible to apply for the full commercial operator’s license. Drivers applying for a CDL learners permit will be required to meet all of the abovementioned requirements, except for passing the driving skills test, which occurs later on to receive the full license. Applications for the CLP are accepted in person, at licensing agencies around the state. The BMV has an up-to-date list of all locations currently processing permit requests. According to IN CDL permit requirements, drivers will have to pass all of the written knowledge tests required, according to the type of license they are requesting. They will also be asked to pass a vision screening. Other requirements may be asked of drivers in some circumstances. Exam results are valid for 180 days. CDL Written Test in Indiana\nAll students must complete the general CDL written test, along with area-specific tests, depending on the driver’s vehicle class and desired endorsements. The CDL general knowledge test is required by all applying drivers, and along with any of the following exams:\n- All commercial vehicles drivers: General knowledge exam\n- All school bus drivers: School bus endorsement exam and passenger transport exam\n- All bus drivers: Passenger transport exam\n- Vehicle with air brakes: Air brakes exam\n- Combination of vehicles: Combination vehicle exam\n- Drivers required to transport hazardous material: Hazardous material exam\n- Drivers required to transport liquids in bulk: Tanker exam\n- Drivers required to pull double or triple trailers: Doubles\/triples exam\nIndiana CDL Training Schools & Practice Tests\nCDL prep for Indiana drivers begins with reviewing the Commercial Driver’s License Manual issued by the BMV, which includes all of the details new commercial drivers need to know for the written and skills exams. Drivers can also choose to enroll in CDL school at any of a number of state-approved locations across the state. The BMV oversees all schooling for commercial drivers in Indiana to assure that they offer top-quality instruction and have qualified teachers. Although enrolling in a program for extra CDL training is highly encouraged by the BMV, it is not one of the requirements for receiving a CLP or full license. Drivers looking for hands-on instruction from drivers with years of experience can especially benefit from signing up. The BMV regularly publishes a list of approved truck driver training schools in Indiana from which drivers can choose. How to Get a CDL License in Indiana\nWhen a driver is ready to apply for a full license, how to get a CDL comes down to scheduling the driving skills exam, and passing all of its parts at the same time.\n\nIf you want to enter the world of truck driving, then you should apply for a CDL or commercial driver’s license training. However, before you apply, make sure that you are ready to handle the job. Truck driving is not just for anyone; it is only for those who can endure the type of work situation that this job involves, such as long hours and extreme conditions behind the wheel. Instruction is to ensure that you are equipped with the proper skills in order to handle the job like an expert. In the end, it all goes back to really wanting the job and being ready to put in the time and effort required to become successful. There different types of CDL requirements depending on the type of class of license that you are applying for. This is especially for those who are seeking additional endorsements to their licenses. New standards requirements have been set in place in order to meet the growing demand for safety and efficiency in the driving capabilities of those involved in commercial activities. This means that what may have worked ten or twenty years ago may not be applicable for those who wish to work as commercial drivers today. You will also need to be updated about newer regulations from the DOT if you want a thorough discussion of these rules. Typically, those who want to work as a semi-truck driver will need to get a Class A driver’s license. The first thing that you have to possess in order to qualify for a Class A commercial driver’s license is to be at the required age. This varies from one state to another as there are states who allow 16 to 17 year olds to apply for an intrastate commercial driver’s license whereas there are others who require applicants to have a minimum age of 18. You must check your local DMV office or website in order to learn more about their age requirements. Next, you will have to apply for an instruction permit. In order to do so, you will have to submit several requirements: a current and active driver’s license, a CDL application form (Form 735-155) which is available at your local DMV office, IDs that show your legal name, proof of your US citizenship or legal status in the US, birth certificate, and your Social Security number. After or before you submit these requirements at the local DMV office, you will be required to undergo a DOT physical exam. The exam is conducted in order to determine your physical fitness for the demanding job of being a commercial driver. After this, you will be asked to pass a written test which shall be based on the DMV CDL manual. You can get a copy of this manual in your local DMV office. Study the manual well before you take the written exam. Once you pass the written exam, you will then be given an instruction permit which will allow you to drive a commercial vehicle as long as you are accompanied by a licensed individual. The permit will only be valid for a set period of time so make sure that you learn as much as you can during the period. The DMV will also require you to undergo a medical and visual exam right before or after you take the actual test depending on the rules in your state. This is to make sure that you do not have a medical condition which can affect your driving capacity. Before your permit expires, you should be able to take the actual or practical exam for a CDL. You will have to visit the DMV office in order to know how you will be able to take this. If you pass this driving test, you will then be given your commercial driver’s license after paying the required fees. Those who desire a Class B driver’s license will often be pursued by those wanting to drive a bus, dump truck, or other commercial vehicle. Where to find CDL Training\nToday, you can find CDL schools in a variety of facilities and institutions. This is due to the fact that there is a large demand for truck drivers in the industry. Truck driving classes are being offered by community colleges, technical and vocational schools, as well as by private trucking companies who are looking for a steady supply of driver’s for their business. If you want to be sure that you are getting the best training possible, you can try searching for those which are accredited by national organizations or by the trucking industry. The training involves both theoretical teaching and practical sessions where you will be required to drive an actual truck. But before you enroll for these classes, you will be required to acquire an instruction permit first from your local DMV or BMV office so you can drive the truck. You also need to be specific about the type of commercial vehicle that you will be practicing on.\n\nIf you haven’t heard of the Drive Safe Act, you may be either shocked or pleased to learn that a bill has been filed that would authorize 18-21 year olds to drive 18-wheelers professionally on the interstate, whereas now they must be 21. In most states, drivers can get their automobile drivers’ license at the age of 16, but the federal law states you must be 21 to drive a truck professionally. If the Drive Safe Act becomes a law, that will change. The Proposed Drive Safe Act\nOn February 26, 2019, The Drive Safe Act bill was introduced that, if passed, states drivers from 18-21 years old will be allowed to drive trucks professionally across state lines. Right now, drivers under the age of 21 can be a professional truck driver, but must remain in their home state until they reach the age of 21. This bill was introduced to reduce the interstate commercial truck driving age to 18 nationally in an effort to address a truck driver shortage. Currently in the United States, there is a 51,000 truck driver shortage and appears to be on a continuing rise, unless something is done. “DRIVE” Safe Act stands for Developing Responsible Individuals for a Vibrant Economy. Because of the concern for interstate safety knowing that 18 year olds may be soon operating 18-wheelers, there are requirements that must be met. First of all, the drivers must log 240 hours of on-duty drive time in the presence of an experienced truck driver as part of their job training. Furthermore, the trucks being driven by the trainees must come equipped with approved safety technologies such as automatic “active breaking” systems and dashboard cameras. Once these requirements are satisfied, that driver(s) will then be eligible to drive the trucks, moving freight, across state lines without limitation. All in Favor Say Aye\nThere are varying opinions on the Drive Safe Act, but those who are in favor of it have their reasons. Supporters strongly believe it will improve the national truck driving shortage and thus, enhance the job economy by giving younger people more job opportunities in this field. Supporters, in response to highway safety concerns, claim with the outlined extensive training program and safety equipped trucks, that safety is not a concern. Their argument is that safety\/training are the focus and not the age of the driver. All Opposed Say Nay\nThis bill has a lot of people shaking their heads wondering how severely this will affect public safety if passed by legislation. Despite what the followers state, those against this Bill claim that age is a factor and studies show that young drivers are more likely to be involved in fatal crashes than their older counterparts. Furthermore, those against this bill state that instead of solving the trucking shortage, they are simply endangering others on the interstate and only putting a Band-Aid on the problem. Their belief is that by putting younger people behind the wheels of 18-wheelers, it will only drive the wages downward due to the increased truck driver expansion pool of young people. Right now, by maintaining a smaller pool of people, the wages remain high and could even rise to a higher level. That is not a Band-Aid, but a solution in the eyes of those protesting this Bill. Nothing to date has been resolved with the Drive Safe Act, so the issue remains until legislation votes.

It is necessary to have a commercial driving license for those who want to drive commercial vehicles or vehicles used for transportation. The CDL is used to operate heavy and large vehicles, vehicles to transport hazardous material, and other commercial vehicles. Commercial vehicles include trucks, buses, and trailers. Driving a commercial vehicle is a huge responsibility so a truck driver or a trailer driver must have a Commercial Truck License for smooth business operations. Types of Commercial Licenses\nCommercial driving licenses include Class A, Class B, and Class C licenses. To get any of the mentioned licenses, you need to pass a test to showcase your driving knowledge, road sense, and specific driving skills. For few drivers, it is highly recommended to have a training from training school to avoid road conditions and accidents\nClass A Commercial Driving License\nClass A driving license is to operate any commercial vehicle with another vehicle like a trailer that weighs more than 26000 pounds. Drivers having a Class A driving license can drive tractor-trailers, 18-wheelers, semi or big rigs, a combination of trucks and trailers, livestock carriers, flatbeds, vehicles related to Class B and Class C, and tanker vehicles. Class B Commercial Driving License\nClass B driving license is to operate any single commercial vehicle (not attached to a trailer) that weighs more than 26000 pounds.

Check for the minimum age requirement before you apply for the commercial driving license. The minimum age requirement varies from state to state. Some states allow applying for a commercial driving license between the ages of 18 to 21. However, some states require a minimum age of 21 years. A single state commercial driving license allows a driver to operate the commercial vehicle within the boundaries of the state of the residence of the drive. There are strict rules and guidelines to obtain a commercial driving license and each state has its regulations and requirements. To get a commercial driving license, you must pass a written knowledge test and a driving skills test, which is designed and conducted by the state itself. - Fulfill the minimum age requirement according to your residential state. - Think about the license type that you want to have. If you need a Class A or Class B driving license, you must complete driving training from an approved training provider or a training school. - Check for the application process and required documents you need to submit with your application. - Complete your application form. Attach all required documents and submit to the concerned office for further proceedings. - Submit your identity and social security number verifications as per the requirements by your state. - Show proof of your residence and proof of the state. - Plan your medical examination from an authorized doctor, laboratory, hospital, or clinic. Submit your complete medical examination report. Make sure to get a certificate that proves that the laboratory or hospital is certified to conduct a medical examination. - Pass the vision test to prove that you can see properly. - Pass a knowledge exam that will prove that you know the basics of driving and know the road signs and other important information. - Now wait for a few days and then schedule your driving test on the road. - Passing a pre-trip inspection is necessary. - Bring your commercial vehicle to pass the road skill test and driving test. - Once you have passed and cleared all exams and tests, pay the necessary fee to get your Commercial Driving License. - If you already have a driving license from one state and want to apply for a driving license of a second state, you must submit the driving record of at least 10 years along with your application.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:32ef2577-818f-4dfe-b8cc-8cc1fdc449d3>"]},{"passage":"FMCSA May Eliminate Driving Experience Criterion in Vision Exemption Process\nA proposed rule from the agency offers two options: driving with a stable vision condition for at least a year or no specific amount of CMV driving experience required. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration is planning to change the eligibility requirements for someone seeking an exemption to operate a commercial motor vehicle without meeting the vision standards. Currently, and since 1998, the requirement has been three years of intrastate CMV driving experience immediately prior to the application date. There are other requirements, including being at least 21 years old, holding a valid license, and no license suspensions or convictions for serious traffic violations while operating any motor vehicle, even a personal vehicle.

This includes recent amendments to drop testing of commercial drivers with conditions like sleep apnea (which makes them more likely to crash), and efforts to pass laws that increase vehicle weight limits, terminate certain Hours-of-Service requirements regarding mandatory driver rest breaks, and reduce the federal age limit for commercial drivers from 21 to 18. With a recent announcement from federal regulators, younger truckers may soon be a common site on our roads. This month, officials from the DOT’s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) announced that they are preparing to launch a pilot program that would test out teen commercial drivers on public roads. Here are few important details about what it involves:\n- Under the FMCSA’s pilot program, drivers between 18 and 20 will be able to drive commercial trucks and vehicles across state lines. Currently, only drivers 21 and older can operate trucks for interstate commerce. - Only drivers who have military experience and training in certain occupational specialists will be allowed to participate in the program. - The pilot program will include policies that require young drivers to complete a 240-hour apprentice driving program where they may only drive with veteran CDL holders and may not exceed 65 mph. - The program is intended to roll out later this year. The announcement has received a great deal of attention, in part because proposed laws to reduce the federal commercial driver age limit have long been supported by the trucking industry since the start of a chronic shortage. In fact, reducing the age limit has been one of the industry’s top solutions for addressing the trucker shortage problem, which is expected to reach nearly 65,000 drivers this year. That’s equal to roughly one commercial tractor-trailer per every 12 cargo loads, the lowest ratio in 15 years. While it may seem like a reasonable solution to the commercial trucking operators and companies that want to keep up with a rising demand for transportation of consumer goods, the proposed age limit reduction has faced harsh scrutiny from public safety advocates who argue that it puts the public at risk while allowing major corporations to profit from cheap labor. Additionally, they cite statistics like those from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which show that teen drivers are approximately 3 times more likely to fatally crash than drivers who are 20 or older. In response to these arguments, proponents and the trucking industry have pointed to the safety apprentice driving policy requiring young drivers to first train with more experienced drivers. They also commonly argue that 18-year-olds are currently allowed to operate commercial vehicles, though within state borders, in many states across the country. Trucking Regulations & Public Safety\nAs a personal injury and workers’ compensation law firm that fights for victims across Chicago and the state of Illinois, our legal team at Leonard Law Group knows how crucially important trucking regulations are to protecting the public and ensuring commercial operators take the necessary steps to reduce risks of serious truck accidents. Over the years, we’ve represented many victims of truck accidents, including drivers of passenger vehicles hit by truckers and truck drivers themselves, and are well aware of the devastating and often life-altering damage these massive machines can cause. Because commercial trucks pose such overwhelming dangers on our roads, we know it is important for advocates, lawmakers, and the public to keep apprised of trucking industry efforts fueled by money and potential profits rather than any concern for public safety. Just because the status quo may allow teens to get behind the wheel of trucks in some states doesn’t mean it should be preserved and strengthened across the board. That’s what many safety advocates will continue to focus on as they track the new pilot program and prepare to fight efforts for implementing the regulatory change nationwide. Fighting for Truck Accident Victims\nAlthough trucking regulations have been prone to change, there are still numerous laws that apply to trucking operators and drivers and make them responsible for taking appropriate safety measures.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:07f77690-d438-48e2-a5a3-7c0529f81909>"]},{"passage":"How to Get a Commercial Drivers License in Indiana\nAll drivers must possess a CDL in Indiana in order to operate a commercial motor vehicle (CMV) in the state.

However, before you apply, make sure that you are ready to handle the job. Truck driving is not just for anyone; it is only for those who can endure the type of work situation that this job involves, such as long hours and extreme conditions behind the wheel. Instruction is to ensure that you are equipped with the proper skills in order to handle the job like an expert. In the end, it all goes back to really wanting the job and being ready to put in the time and effort required to become successful. There different types of CDL requirements depending on the type of class of license that you are applying for. This is especially for those who are seeking additional endorsements to their licenses. New standards requirements have been set in place in order to meet the growing demand for safety and efficiency in the driving capabilities of those involved in commercial activities. This means that what may have worked ten or twenty years ago may not be applicable for those who wish to work as commercial drivers today. You will also need to be updated about newer regulations from the DOT if you want a thorough discussion of these rules. Typically, those who want to work as a semi-truck driver will need to get a Class A driver’s license. The first thing that you have to possess in order to qualify for a Class A commercial driver’s license is to be at the required age. This varies from one state to another as there are states who allow 16 to 17 year olds to apply for an intrastate commercial driver’s license whereas there are others who require applicants to have a minimum age of 18. You must check your local DMV office or website in order to learn more about their age requirements. Next, you will have to apply for an instruction permit. In order to do so, you will have to submit several requirements: a current and active driver’s license, a CDL application form (Form 735-155) which is available at your local DMV office, IDs that show your legal name, proof of your US citizenship or legal status in the US, birth certificate, and your Social Security number. After or before you submit these requirements at the local DMV office, you will be required to undergo a DOT physical exam. The exam is conducted in order to determine your physical fitness for the demanding job of being a commercial driver. After this, you will be asked to pass a written test which shall be based on the DMV CDL manual. You can get a copy of this manual in your local DMV office. Study the manual well before you take the written exam. Once you pass the written exam, you will then be given an instruction permit which will allow you to drive a commercial vehicle as long as you are accompanied by a licensed individual. The permit will only be valid for a set period of time so make sure that you learn as much as you can during the period. The DMV will also require you to undergo a medical and visual exam right before or after you take the actual test depending on the rules in your state. This is to make sure that you do not have a medical condition which can affect your driving capacity. Before your permit expires, you should be able to take the actual or practical exam for a CDL. You will have to visit the DMV office in order to know how you will be able to take this. If you pass this driving test, you will then be given your commercial driver’s license after paying the required fees. Those who desire a Class B driver’s license will often be pursued by those wanting to drive a bus, dump truck, or other commercial vehicle. Where to find CDL Training\nToday, you can find CDL schools in a variety of facilities and institutions. This is due to the fact that there is a large demand for truck drivers in the industry. Truck driving classes are being offered by community colleges, technical and vocational schools, as well as by private trucking companies who are looking for a steady supply of driver’s for their business. If you want to be sure that you are getting the best training possible, you can try searching for those which are accredited by national organizations or by the trucking industry. The training involves both theoretical teaching and practical sessions where you will be required to drive an actual truck. But before you enroll for these classes, you will be required to acquire an instruction permit first from your local DMV or BMV office so you can drive the truck.

All in Favor Say Aye\nThere are varying opinions on the Drive Safe Act, but those who are in favor of it have their reasons. Supporters strongly believe it will improve the national truck driving shortage and thus, enhance the job economy by giving younger people more job opportunities in this field. Supporters, in response to highway safety concerns, claim with the outlined extensive training program and safety equipped trucks, that safety is not a concern. Their argument is that safety\/training are the focus and not the age of the driver. All Opposed Say Nay\nThis bill has a lot of people shaking their heads wondering how severely this will affect public safety if passed by legislation. Despite what the followers state, those against this Bill claim that age is a factor and studies show that young drivers are more likely to be involved in fatal crashes than their older counterparts. Furthermore, those against this bill state that instead of solving the trucking shortage, they are simply endangering others on the interstate and only putting a Band-Aid on the problem. Their belief is that by putting younger people behind the wheels of 18-wheelers, it will only drive the wages downward due to the increased truck driver expansion pool of young people. Right now, by maintaining a smaller pool of people, the wages remain high and could even rise to a higher level. That is not a Band-Aid, but a solution in the eyes of those protesting this Bill. Nothing to date has been resolved with the Drive Safe Act, so the issue remains until legislation votes.

Yo ho! A pirate's life for me. Okay, when I say pirates, what's the first thing that comes to your mind? Chances\nare, you just pictured the skull and crossbones, some dude that looks like Captain\nHook, or even that drunk guy hanging out with a pig in the Pirates of the Caribbean\nride at Disneyland. But what if the path of history took a different course\nand pirates turned out to be smooth talking, fearless warriors of the air rather\nthan liquor-guzzling sea ruffians? Well, Microsoft and Zipper Interactive have\nimagined just that and cranked out a game worthy of an old Hollywood studio. It is a world of gutsy pilots and high adventure. The Great Depression has\nstruck, destroying the progress of all ground transportation, leaving the skies\nto serve as the ultimate roadway of the future. Here, survival means gripping\nthe flight stick of a tricked-out muscle plane and letting your guns do the\ntalking. Fly or die with the guys and dolls of Crimson Skies. Crimson Skies is a beautiful, guns-blazing, lip-biting, heart-pounding\nflight action game. Packed with plenty of attitude, the game's combination of\nsim elements and arcade hijinks sets it apart from the rest of the field\nOne of Crimson Skies' biggest assets is the universe that it is set\nin. Starting off as an air-combat based board game, the world of Crimson Skies\nis intricately detailed and well chronicled. Everything about the game, from\nthe characters to the movies to the sound, simply screams romantic era 1930's\nYou are Nathan Zachary, the heroic Robin Hood of the skies. With your band\nof merry men and women known as the Fortune Hunters, you'll fly over 24 missions\nto defend justice, honor, and a fat wallet. I mean, what is piracy without a\nlittle booty here and there? The FMV cut scenes lend a hand in creating the tone of the game by taking on\nfeel of watching an old feature film from Hollywood's early days. Run in black\nand white with all the static of the old films, these movie sequences are like\nsomething out of a History Channel documentary. With all this good stuff going for it, the only thing that could shoot down\nthis game would be bad gameplay. Fortunately, gameplay is where Crimson Skies\ntruly soars. In much the same way as the Playstaion smash hit Driver,\nthe game does a marvelous balancing act between flight sim realism and in-your-face,\nfrantic action. Players can jump into the thick of things without reading volumes\nupon volumes of flight manuals. While you don't need to boggle your mind with\nthoughts of ailerons and HUD's, you do need to watch out for engine stalls and\nthat pesky gravity, which will cancel your flight faster than a rogue hurricane\noff the Florida coast. This is definitely a game for gamers, not flight school\nall this goodness isn't enough, the Crimson Skies crew keeps it coming. The game runs on a tweaked version of the Combat Flight Sim engine\nto bring you some superior visuals. The graphics are excellent, with smooth\ntextures and plenty of details everywhere. You'll see your plane take damage\nand catch fire when the action gets hot and heavy, witness wing flaps move as\nyour plane changes directions, and delight as stray shots hitting the water\nsend splashes skyward. As you progress through the missions, you'll gain money that can be put towards\nthe purchase of your very own custom plane. We're not just talking about a new\ncoat of paint, we're talking about a choice of engine, armor, style and payload. Of course, your new frame must be able to support the weight of it all, so don't\nget too carried away. For those of you that just want to jump into the fray without any of this\n\"story\" business, Crimson Skies also includes an Instant Action mode. Want to dogfight a squadron of enemy fighters? No problem. Try to hijack a zeppelin? You got it. If time is short or you just feel like blowing stuff up, this mode\nhas what it takes to fulfill all your piratical needs. The game's music also immerses you completely in a 1930's mindset with authentic\nsounding swing music. The Grade-A voice acting is terrific as well.\n\nI was able to play a few levels at a Capcom event yesterday and also bring a build to the office, giving me a look at a few levels from various bits of the game as well as the opening sequences. The game starts off with you playing as soldier, testing out a new Tesla-designed rocket pack. Of course, no game would be complete without a sneak attack by the enemy, so a group of UFOs show up to give you an introduction to the game's flight mechanics. After dispatching a group of them, the character you start with looks to be killed and you then take control of the game's protagonist, Will, about a week later. By default, the flight controls are inverted to act like regular plane controls, while the ground combat is not, which for me helps make it feel a little more separated. If you've played Crimson Skies, you'll be familiar with a lot of the dual-stick clicking special moves, like flip reversals and dodges. This isn't very surprising as the Airtight Games team was formed from the dissolved staff that worked on Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge, and their experience shows through nicely as the controls are smooth, responsive and relatively easy to use. This sequence, which I also had a chance to play at the event as there's a nearly identical (but much more extended) sequence later in the game, takes place near a cliff side overlooking an ocean. Large rock pillars give you plenty of things to dodge and use for cover during the battle to make it more interesting than open air. In the prologue, you basically just take down a couple ships and then get put out of your misery. When you return later as Will, after you clear the skies you'll need to turn your attention to some ground troops. One cool bit to the game is that the flying and ground-based mechanics are blurred by your ability to hover. When you do this, you're still airborne and can travel in six directions (albeit much more slowly than standard flight), but you also have total control over where you're shooting rather than just in front of you. The game encourages you to make use of your hovering ability as the enemies will have a harder time picking you out of the sky than if you're standing on solid ground. Since I had just jumped right into this sequence (the first thing I played was the second time in the part, playing as Will), switching between flying, standing on solid ground and hovering took some getting used to strictly in a button command sense (I can't even remember how to do it offhand), though I imagine that when you actually run through the game this'll be much more natural by this point. While the flight bits feel a lot like Crimson Skies (which is great), the ground combat is very much akin to what you'll find in a lot of third-person shooters these days, which makes it easy to jump right into. You can take cover and then fire blindly, aim down your sights with some guns and generally go about things like you would in something like Uncharted or Gears of War. Again though, what makes this unique is the ability to take to the skies at pretty much any time and change up the way you take on combat. You won't always have flight, though. Early on in the game, once you take control of Will, you'll be on foot and fighting enemies in a more \"classic\" sense until you eventually find the jet pack. This opening sequence takes place in the jungle, and while you won't find the sort of platforming bits to do ala Uncharted, it does make for a rather stark contrast to the more mechanical stuff you'll see later on. An example of this is a cylindrical generator shaft that you'll come to later where you're tasked with shutting down the power. Blue electrical bolts fly pretty much everywhere here, and the deep chasm formed by the shaft means that you'll have to make use of your hover ability a lot during combat. Dark Void is set to ship early next year. In the meantime, take a look at our media pages for new screens and video, and keep your eyes peeled for details on how you can win a Tesla Roadster as part of a promotional giveaway that Capcom is holding for the game.\n\n\"Grant Howitt's games are always strong on play experiences. With Spire, he and Chris Taylor have carved out a compelling space for us to play in, too -- a dark, desperate setting that nonetheless has room for hope and beauty, and looks very different from the familiar worlds of mainstream roleplaying games.” - merritt k, host of Woodland Secrets, designer of Vin Diesel DMing a Game of D&D Just For You\n\"I'm so glad you guys are creating another game together.\" - Rob Heinsoo, lead designer on D&D 4e and 13th Age\n“Spire deals with skills in a way that makes every check as interesting and as much of a threat as combat, the world feels huge and unique, and the classes are just beautifully ridiculous.” - Dylan Malenfant, playtester\n“Spire is a tinderbox of evocative potential weaved together to form the most compelling setting I've read this decade. It features the kind of resonance Neil Gaiman aims for on a good day.” - Sean Smith, author of Exuviae\n\"This setting is really dazzling. I want to try out these characters!\" - Jason Cordova of The Gauntlet podcast\n\"So you're telling me one of the classes just comes with a hyena? 'Core abilities: Hyena' is what you should put on the cover instead of review blurbs.\" - General Ironicus of the Six Feats Under podcast\n“I've never said 'I want to use that' so many times as when making my Spire character. Every word reinforces the eerie setting, and the mechanics fizz with a perfect blend of weirdness, power and risk.” - Clare Jones, playtester\n\"Grant Howitt always seems to be involved in the kinds of games that make me wish I had more time to play games – and more time to write games. Always inspiring and challenging. The Spire is no different, with a strong focus on storytelling, the mechanics geared towards great roleplaying in a world that offers something we’ve not seen before. The sort of game experience that’s not just fun, but actually rewarding to play.\" - Gav Thorpe, author of Inquisitor and, like, half the Warhammer 40k universe\nWHAT IS THE SPIRE? Spire is a new stand-alone roleplaying game from the designers of Unbound and Goblin Quest. It’s like D&D crossed with Unknown Armies, or Gormenghast crossed with Necromunda: a city-bound fantasy horror game of terrible decisions, hard choices, and deeply personal loss. Spire is a city of a thousand gods: Our Glorious Lady, the light of the moon, beloved of the drow (and her sisters, the dark side of the moon and the eclipse, whose worship is banned by the high elves); the Solar Pantheon, great and terrible, who dominate the city from glittering cathedrals; the ravenous Hungry Deep that slumbers beneath the city; the laughing carrion god Charnel, whose hyenas prowl the bloody streets of New Heaven. Worship of these gods can grant miracles to the faithful - player characters included. It is a place of industry and profit: human retro-engineers arrive with armfuls of arcane technology dug up from forgotten dungeons of a lost civilisation, then hotwire them into life and sell cheap copies down in the lawless undercity. There are acres of underground lakes brimming with algae; dark farms where the dead hang from spidersilk, their bodies dotted with fungi; and the vast, cursed, never-completed Vermissian, a failed attempt at a subterranean travel network. It is a place of horror, too: bloodwitches return from the Heart, the rotten hole in reality that is the centre of Spire, carrying mystical blood diseases that rewrite men’s minds; spider-skinned midwives sprout additional chitinous limbs to defend unborn drow; magic masks are sutured to unwilling faces; hearts are plucked out and stored in jars, so that the owner might have eternal, strange life at the hands of the Morticians.\n\nIn order to tell what effect a weapon or piece of armor will have on a party member’s arsenal of spells, you must first enter a menu, equip it, back out, enter another menu and examine the new skill set. The idea of a short, inexpensive micro-RPG that focuses on replayability through new game+ rather than homogeneous padding is brilliant, and perfectly suited to handhelds like the 3DS and Vita. Unfortunately, Crimson Shroud weighs down its own lean package with too many UI oddities, trial-and-error gameplay and cliched plot points to let its own brilliance soar. The best thing I can say about Crimson Shroud is that in this sequel-driven industry, we probably haven’t seen the last of the ideas on display here. And that is definitely a good thing. This review is based on a copy of Crimson Shroud provided to SideQuesting by the publisher.\n\nIn this post I will talk about the future features of the game and ideas of mine. Feel free to comment! One of my goal is, that the game should be 2-3 hours long. I believe that is a huge amount of work but I am optimistic that I can do it. The game is not an open world game. It is level based like Cry of Fear. You go to a door, press “e” and you load the next level. You can also go back to see if you missed something. If you think of Cry of Fear, there was an inventory system. This won’t be in Obscuritas. The only things you will be able to pick up are keys and notes. As it is usual in a horror game, there will be some evil stuff in the game, like scares. Therefore Obscuritas is more an interactive story than an “real” FPS. While you play you discover more and more about Vincent and what happened to him. Of course there will be some things you can do and you also should feel scared while you play it. For now that’s all I want to tell. I will write development diaries when I have done enough for one. That’s why you should stay tuned to me and my game. You can also read this on IndieDB:\n\nVincent has predicted this game might \"behave in some subtly strange ways online.\" (linky\nI'm not too worried. I think the game will play fine. We can, however, expect some rules discussion, so this thread is for that. From reading the rule clarification questions that have popped up in places, I see some advice and feedback that I think will help our on-line play. Tips\nWe should Describe Actions first; consequences are negotiated later. (Vincent, The Forge\nBe comfortable to back track slightly from described events. The above distinction (Action vs. consequences) might not be entirely clear at all times. If we find confusion, we might need to rewind a bit. Be prudent with your narrative power. Unless another character \"can and would try to interfere\" with the stated concrete action, we don't roll dice. Also, I'd like to put out some words of encouragement to keep the enthusiasm and posting pace going. Each post need not be some spectacular literary event. Any response is better than letting the game die. So don't hesitate to ask other players for input or ideas. Even just \"dialing it in\" on occasion to keep the story moving is perfectly fine with me.\n\nCrimson Shroud blends the design from the old-school class of turn-based JRPG with the oldest of the old west(ern style of role-playing games). I’m not talking about Baldur’s Gate or Icewind Dale, either. I’m talking about 20-sided dice, percentage chances and saving throws. The success of just about everything you do during Crimson Shroud’s otherwise fairly traditional turn-based combat is determined and\/or enhanced by using the 3DS touchscreen to roll digital dice. Dice don’t just play a role in the game’s look, however. Starting a combo by repeatedly casting spells of different elements will earn you more dice that can then be added either to your odds of successfully attacking or to the damage dealt by them. But, if you think you can get by without, banking your dice for later will allow you to loot more items at the end of combat. Further supporting the game’s style is the fact that every character in the game — from NPCs to party members — is represented by a mounted miniature. More important in bringing the style to life than either of those touches is the game’s dedication to narration. The entire story (which is, unfortunately, conveyed entirely without voice acting) is narrated by a sort of disembodied dungeon master in the second-person. Of all the wonderful touches Crimson Shroud includes to set the stage, this is the most effective and endearingly low-tech. It’s a shame, then, that the story Level 5 decided to tell isn’t very exciting. Our band of heroes is sent off in search of the titular and mysterious Crimson Shroud, rumored to be the source of the magical “gifts” that makes the game’s world go round. Besides a couple of predictable twists and a cliffhanger ending, that’s more or less the entire story. Crimson Shroud isn’t a terribly long game. That’s understandable considering its $8 price tag and status as a Guild01 experiment. That’s not meant as a knock against the game. Crimson Shroud doesn’t try to make you feel like it’s the only game you’ll need all year. It sets up an interesting structure and the tools to play with it, and then wraps up once its tricks have been exhausted. Crimson Shroud knows when its time is up and doesn’t try to claw at your free time for more than you have the patience to offer. That’s something that every RPG could stand to learn. What really keeps the game concise is the way that it completely circumvents the issue of grinding by ignoring character leveling systems entirely. Regrettably only leads to another. Since stats and magic attacks are tied to gear drops rather than character progression it’s easy to find yourself completely unprepared for enemy encounters. This traps you in the cycle of picking a fight, hoping you have whatever spells will work properly and then either dying or restarting from your last save and trying again with different gear if you found yourself unprepared. Poking the touchscreen to set virtual d20s tumbling is no more effective than plucking a random integer from thin air. It’s a neat gimmick, but one that can start to feel tedious once you start to think about what you’re actually doing. It’s also painfully obvious that the molded miniature aesthetic and non-voiced story were chosen as much for their cost-effectiveness as nostalgia. It certainly doesn’t help that most of the character models are so poorly rendered that it’s often difficult to make out exactly what they’re supposed to look like. However, none of that makes the player feel any less like a massive nerd scratching charisma bonuses onto a character sheet. That sense of belonging that only understanding acronyms like GURPS (ahem) can engender has (perhaps justifiably) been missing from games for some time. While Crimson Shroud certainly isn’t Planescape: Torment 2 (ahem), it does feel like a heartfelt attempt at invoking those old feelings in new ways. On its own, that loop is incredibly frustrating, particularly during boss fights. Delivering further disappointing drudgery is the developer’s baffling decision to make the abilities associated with an item invisible until they’ve been equipped.\n\nDoes the game contain the ingredients the author chose? Are they nice and central? Is the use of them interesting? Is the game tight? Does it have no distracting bits that get cut off in actual play? Is the setting completely supported by the system? Is the system completely enclosed by the setting? Does the game do what it tries to do? Judging on polish of presentation is unfair for a short project like this. But still, I want to see a game with flair and interesting stuff and ideas. Can I pick this up and run with it? I don't mean \"Did you remember the 'what is roleplaying' chapter\" (unless you're making a very non-traditional game), but I do want it to have enough rules to be able to play, enough description to know how I am to play it, enough setting to know what I'm playing, and enough ideas that as a GM and a player I can think of at least a few different ways things could go. The most important, but hardest to describe category. Is your game enjoyable? Is it pure awesome?\n\nThis page will help you build pages for games. Duh. Explain the origins of the game.

If it has no story just skip this section. What characters are involved\/playable in the game\n\nWhat is Cyberpunk 2077 gameplay like? Cyberpunk 2077 is a role-playing first-person shooter, and the character named, V is fully customizable according to cdkeysforgames.com. You have a lot of choices when it comes to creating your male or female, V character. In the appearance section, you can choose the body type, face, hair, and voice just to name a few. There are several classifications and gameplay options that are sure to give a unique identity regardless of your choices. Your V character will have several stats to increase as you play and they’re capable of numerous actions such as climbing walls and taking cover and there are multiple weapon choices and essentially all the fully customizable game options that you would expect from a new first-person shooter\nThe world of Cyberpunk 2077. V is a mercenary running gun in the face of a tragic dystopian city, fallen into crime and violence in the wake of a major economic crash. Homelessness and violence abound in the city so it is a survival of the fittest. It is a world full of crime lords and big business that is above the law and justice. The desperate situation of the city is not a sign of dark or boring graphics. The city is described as a beautiful technological and futuristic wonder. The towering skyscrapers and the world of neon are only contrasted by life on the ground that can get down and dirty. The city is teeming with people and flying cars and it seems to have a lot of atmosphere going on. In a matrix styled world with cyborgs, there is no shortage of guns and speed as you make the city your own. What is the inspiration for Cyberpunk 2077? Some of the inspiration for cyberpunk 2077 comes from the 1982 science fiction movie Bladerunner. But there are inspirational points all through the game that draw from an assortment of Manga, Anime, books and video games. The voice and motion action for Johnny Silverhand is that of Keanu Reeves. There is much more inspiration going on throughout the game. The somewhat hidden codes when it comes to inspirational points seem to add to the mystery and culture of the game world. Development and release. Cyberpunk 2077 has been a long time coming. First announced in 2012, fans had little to go on except a teaser trailer released in 2013. But it seems the wait is about over and the only date we have to go on now is April 16, 2020. Pre-orders have already begun and we will soon get the green light for play. Cyberpunk 2077 has already received numerous awards and plans for books, postcards, stickers, and soundtrack are already in the making. The game is about to begin.","passages":[{"passage":"Yo ho!

By default, the flight controls are inverted to act like regular plane controls, while the ground combat is not, which for me helps make it feel a little more separated. If you've played Crimson Skies, you'll be familiar with a lot of the dual-stick clicking special moves, like flip reversals and dodges. This isn't very surprising as the Airtight Games team was formed from the dissolved staff that worked on Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge, and their experience shows through nicely as the controls are smooth, responsive and relatively easy to use. This sequence, which I also had a chance to play at the event as there's a nearly identical (but much more extended) sequence later in the game, takes place near a cliff side overlooking an ocean. Large rock pillars give you plenty of things to dodge and use for cover during the battle to make it more interesting than open air. In the prologue, you basically just take down a couple ships and then get put out of your misery. When you return later as Will, after you clear the skies you'll need to turn your attention to some ground troops. One cool bit to the game is that the flying and ground-based mechanics are blurred by your ability to hover. When you do this, you're still airborne and can travel in six directions (albeit much more slowly than standard flight), but you also have total control over where you're shooting rather than just in front of you. The game encourages you to make use of your hovering ability as the enemies will have a harder time picking you out of the sky than if you're standing on solid ground. Since I had just jumped right into this sequence (the first thing I played was the second time in the part, playing as Will), switching between flying, standing on solid ground and hovering took some getting used to strictly in a button command sense (I can't even remember how to do it offhand), though I imagine that when you actually run through the game this'll be much more natural by this point. While the flight bits feel a lot like Crimson Skies (which is great), the ground combat is very much akin to what you'll find in a lot of third-person shooters these days, which makes it easy to jump right into. You can take cover and then fire blindly, aim down your sights with some guns and generally go about things like you would in something like Uncharted or Gears of War. Again though, what makes this unique is the ability to take to the skies at pretty much any time and change up the way you take on combat. You won't always have flight, though. Early on in the game, once you take control of Will, you'll be on foot and fighting enemies in a more \"classic\" sense until you eventually find the jet pack. This opening sequence takes place in the jungle, and while you won't find the sort of platforming bits to do ala Uncharted, it does make for a rather stark contrast to the more mechanical stuff you'll see later on. An example of this is a cylindrical generator shaft that you'll come to later where you're tasked with shutting down the power. Blue electrical bolts fly pretty much everywhere here, and the deep chasm formed by the shaft means that you'll have to make use of your hover ability a lot during combat. Dark Void is set to ship early next year.

Spire is a new stand-alone roleplaying game from the designers of Unbound and Goblin Quest. It’s like D&D crossed with Unknown Armies, or Gormenghast crossed with Necromunda: a city-bound fantasy horror game of terrible decisions, hard choices, and deeply personal loss. Spire is a city of a thousand gods: Our Glorious Lady, the light of the moon, beloved of the drow (and her sisters, the dark side of the moon and the eclipse, whose worship is banned by the high elves); the Solar Pantheon, great and terrible, who dominate the city from glittering cathedrals; the ravenous Hungry Deep that slumbers beneath the city; the laughing carrion god Charnel, whose hyenas prowl the bloody streets of New Heaven. Worship of these gods can grant miracles to the faithful - player characters included. It is a place of industry and profit: human retro-engineers arrive with armfuls of arcane technology dug up from forgotten dungeons of a lost civilisation, then hotwire them into life and sell cheap copies down in the lawless undercity. There are acres of underground lakes brimming with algae; dark farms where the dead hang from spidersilk, their bodies dotted with fungi; and the vast, cursed, never-completed Vermissian, a failed attempt at a subterranean travel network. It is a place of horror, too: bloodwitches return from the Heart, the rotten hole in reality that is the centre of Spire, carrying mystical blood diseases that rewrite men’s minds; spider-skinned midwives sprout additional chitinous limbs to defend unborn drow; magic masks are sutured to unwilling faces; hearts are plucked out and stored in jars, so that the owner might have eternal, strange life at the hands of the Morticians.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:7a8a5c85-be2f-423b-9c36-fd8767d87000>"]},{"passage":"In order to tell what effect a weapon or piece of armor will have on a party member’s arsenal of spells, you must first enter a menu, equip it, back out, enter another menu and examine the new skill set.

It is level based like Cry of Fear. You go to a door, press “e” and you load the next level. You can also go back to see if you missed something. If you think of Cry of Fear, there was an inventory system. This won’t be in Obscuritas. The only things you will be able to pick up are keys and notes. As it is usual in a horror game, there will be some evil stuff in the game, like scares. Therefore Obscuritas is more an interactive story than an “real” FPS. While you play you discover more and more about Vincent and what happened to him. Of course there will be some things you can do and you also should feel scared while you play it.

I’m not talking about Baldur’s Gate or Icewind Dale, either. I’m talking about 20-sided dice, percentage chances and saving throws. The success of just about everything you do during Crimson Shroud’s otherwise fairly traditional turn-based combat is determined and\/or enhanced by using the 3DS touchscreen to roll digital dice. Dice don’t just play a role in the game’s look, however. Starting a combo by repeatedly casting spells of different elements will earn you more dice that can then be added either to your odds of successfully attacking or to the damage dealt by them. But, if you think you can get by without, banking your dice for later will allow you to loot more items at the end of combat. Further supporting the game’s style is the fact that every character in the game — from NPCs to party members — is represented by a mounted miniature. More important in bringing the style to life than either of those touches is the game’s dedication to narration. The entire story (which is, unfortunately, conveyed entirely without voice acting) is narrated by a sort of disembodied dungeon master in the second-person. Of all the wonderful touches Crimson Shroud includes to set the stage, this is the most effective and endearingly low-tech. It’s a shame, then, that the story Level 5 decided to tell isn’t very exciting. Our band of heroes is sent off in search of the titular and mysterious Crimson Shroud, rumored to be the source of the magical “gifts” that makes the game’s world go round. Besides a couple of predictable twists and a cliffhanger ending, that’s more or less the entire story. Crimson Shroud isn’t a terribly long game. That’s understandable considering its $8 price tag and status as a Guild01 experiment. That’s not meant as a knock against the game. Crimson Shroud doesn’t try to make you feel like it’s the only game you’ll need all year. It sets up an interesting structure and the tools to play with it, and then wraps up once its tricks have been exhausted. Crimson Shroud knows when its time is up and doesn’t try to claw at your free time for more than you have the patience to offer. That’s something that every RPG could stand to learn. What really keeps the game concise is the way that it completely circumvents the issue of grinding by ignoring character leveling systems entirely. Regrettably only leads to another. Since stats and magic attacks are tied to gear drops rather than character progression it’s easy to find yourself completely unprepared for enemy encounters. This traps you in the cycle of picking a fight, hoping you have whatever spells will work properly and then either dying or restarting from your last save and trying again with different gear if you found yourself unprepared. Poking the touchscreen to set virtual d20s tumbling is no more effective than plucking a random integer from thin air. It’s a neat gimmick, but one that can start to feel tedious once you start to think about what you’re actually doing. It’s also painfully obvious that the molded miniature aesthetic and non-voiced story were chosen as much for their cost-effectiveness as nostalgia. It certainly doesn’t help that most of the character models are so poorly rendered that it’s often difficult to make out exactly what they’re supposed to look like. However, none of that makes the player feel any less like a massive nerd scratching charisma bonuses onto a character sheet. That sense of belonging that only understanding acronyms like GURPS (ahem) can engender has (perhaps justifiably) been missing from games for some time. While Crimson Shroud certainly isn’t Planescape: Torment 2 (ahem), it does feel like a heartfelt attempt at invoking those old feelings in new ways. On its own, that loop is incredibly frustrating, particularly during boss fights. Delivering further disappointing drudgery is the developer’s baffling decision to make the abilities associated with an item invisible until they’ve been equipped.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:81835028-627f-4f0e-beca-60288697ae07>"]},{"passage":"Does the game contain the ingredients the author chose?

V is a mercenary running gun in the face of a tragic dystopian city, fallen into crime and violence in the wake of a major economic crash. Homelessness and violence abound in the city so it is a survival of the fittest. It is a world full of crime lords and big business that is above the law and justice. The desperate situation of the city is not a sign of dark or boring graphics. The city is described as a beautiful technological and futuristic wonder. The towering skyscrapers and the world of neon are only contrasted by life on the ground that can get down and dirty.

Some of the inspiration for cyberpunk 2077 comes from the 1982 science fiction movie Bladerunner. But there are inspirational points all through the game that draw from an assortment of Manga, Anime, books and video games. The voice and motion action for Johnny Silverhand is that of Keanu Reeves. There is much more inspiration going on throughout the game. The somewhat hidden codes when it comes to inspirational points seem to add to the mystery and culture of the game world.

Here we cover types of children’s savings accounts and a four step plan to achieve your goal. We have a lot to save for. University tuition fees, living costs, house prices and life expectancy are all on the rise. Helping fund your child’s future has never been more important. Savings providers and the government have also recognised the pressing need to support future finances, and the range of products available to make saving and investing for children accessible. It’s never too early to start saving, and putting aside money for a child today will mean they may have more tomorrow. What savings accounts are out there? How do I get started? 1. Consider a goal\nIt could be a good idea to choose a goal to save towards for your child, but it’s equally just as important to save for the sake of it. The goal may well materialise as you’re saving, and it means you’ve started making a difference to their future without knowing what it may look like. 2. Make sure you know how much you can save\nHaving a plan to reach a certain level of saving or to reach a specific goal is a useful way of sticking to your commitment. Knowing how you’re going to save such as lump sum, regular payments or a combination of both, even if you start small, is the best approach you can take. 3. Decide where to save\nChoose a product that you’re comfortable with. How you’re saving should suit you, your capacity for risk, tax benefits and desired returns. 4. Keep an eye on your savings\nEnsure you review your savings regularly to make sure you’re on the right path. Sticking to a plan is important, as over time you should see your child’s savings grow.\n\nThe benefits of day care\nChild care (“daycare” and\/or “creche”) is the caring for and supervision of a child or children, usually from age six weeks to age thirteen. Child care is the action or skill of looking after children by a day-care center, babysitter, or other providers. The Benefits of Learning Center\nThe experiences kids have in a learning centre, consisting of a play group, preschool, nursery & kindergarten, in the early years have profound effects on their future as these are the formative years during which a child grows rapidly till the age of five. A PLEDGE – Mutual Respect\nChild care is a profession and not a babysitting service. It is a profession where children are being taken care and being molded for the future. Childcare providers are professionals; please do not refer to them as babysitters. Mutual R-E-S-P-E-C-T goes a long way!\n\nChild Care Policies.

All along the Hinman Fisherman’s Trail was one of my favorite early season flowers, the Glacier lily (Erythronium grandiflorum). This exquisite and delicate small flower features curved yellow petals with stamens that protrude from the flower’s center. The leafless stems are 6 to 12 inches long and bend at the top giving the flower an elegant drooping profile.\nAlso called dogtooth violet and snow lily, glacier lilies provide early season food for much wildlife in our area, including bears, deer and elk who eat the corms (the swollen underground part of the stem that stores energy for next year — not quite a bulb, but close) and green seed pods, as will sheep and cattle. Ground squirrels and other rodents dig up the corms and store them for winter consumption.\nAlthough it is a really pretty flower that would look great in a meadow or garden, it generally should not be dug up from its habitats in the wild as it sends its corms deep into the soil. Most of us would end up digging up only the leaves and their stems, killing the pretty plant.\nIt’s an edible plant, as well as a spring beauty. The corm is edible raw but tastier and easier to digest when cooked. The stems and leaves of glacier lilies are also edible, although less nutritious than the corms, and can sometimes be found adding a touch of color and texture to salad greens. The seedpod, which forms after the flower bloom has ended, is also edible and can be eaten raw or cooked. It tastes a little like green beans. As with any of these wild edible plants, it’s best to eat in moderation to avoid upsetting your stomach.\nLater in the week, I hiked the Sarvis Creek trail in the southern part of the county and was enchanted by all the Mountain Bluebells (Mertensia ciliata ) in bloom along the way. A member of the Boraginaceae (forget- me-not or borage) family, this widely dispersed perennial features a four-foot tall, three-foot wide plant with blue-green leaves that feature fine hairs (hence the name ciliata) and small, bell-shaped flower clusters that start out light blue and become pinkish purple as the flower ages. It’s usually found in wet meadows and along stream banks throughout the western U.S. and is sometimes found as a single plant but often as a whole colony along a stream or wet meadow. It’s an aromatic and beautiful early season flower.\nThe bell-shaped flowers are edible, as are the leaves, but the leaves aren’t very palatable raw with their hairy coating. Native Americans had medicinal uses for this plant.\nAs the weather turns nice, be sure to get out and see all the early-season wildflowers our part of the mountains feature during this short blooming season.\nDeb Babcock is a volunteer Master Gardener through the CSU Extension Routt County.\nSupport Local Journalism\nSupport Local Journalism\nReaders around Steamboat and Routt County make the Steamboat Pilot & Today’s work possible.

Seen in almost every farm house's yard where I grew up. They lined the old railroad tracks where I played as a kid; we called them tiger lilies though I don't know why and stomped over them on our quest for black caps. They seemed to be everywhere except my own back yard. That is, until this year. After discovering last summer through Hank Shaw's blog that these common daylilies are edible, I had to give them a try. I found a patch of plants and cooked up a few buds and tubers and declared them delicious. Color me surprised! I figured they'd make a fine addition to our summer menu so I begged a patch of them off of my in-laws to plant in my own yard. They were more than happy to let me dig up a load of them because as anyone who has these knows, they grow (and spread) like weeds. Our lily patch is pretty small this year but we've been able to get a few harvests of buds so far. In a year or two I should have enough that I can start thinning them out and then I'll be able to harvest the root tubers, which taste like fingerling potatoes. For now we're enjoying our buds sauteed in butter with a little salt. For me they taste a bit like a cross between a green bean and asparagus. Cooked just briefly they have a nice texture too. Seriously, did I mention, oh yum? I recently read that you can pickle the buds, and I suppose they'd be good deep fried, (because like, what isn't? ), or tossed in stir fry. The whole plant is edible actually and I've already promised to deep fry the flowers for my son who loves, and has been deprived of this year, squash blossoms. I love having useful plants in the yard. How about you? per the Peterson Field Guide - Edible Wild Plants:\nOn identifying the edible day-lily \"Note the unspotted tawny blossoms (open 1 day only) facing upward from the top of a leafless flowerstalk.

Today, many restaurant chefs and innovative home cooks garnish their entrees with flower blossoms for a touch of elegance.\n\nIf you were hunting this weekend and got lost, would you know what you could eat? Knowing what plants are edible and which ones are not can be the difference between life and death\nIdentifying edible plants\nThe first rule to follow is that if you can’t positively identify a plant, don’t eat it. A plant could be poisonous and if you identify it incorrectly, that could be a bad end. To complicate things, some plants are fine to eat when they are young but become poisonous later on in their growth. Some plants are poisonous during certain seasons. Others just have certain parts of the plants that are poisonous. While some of the plants below will not fit these descriptions, as a general rule of thumb, avoid plants that have:\n• spines, fine hairs or thorns\n• beans, bulbs or seeds inside the pod\n• a grainy head with pink, purple or black spurs\n• a three-leaf growing pattern\nWhere to find edible plants\nIf you are in a humid region, most of the plants will be in sunny areas. If you are in a dry region, the majority of the plants will be found near water sources. It’s a good idea to locate a local plant guidebook and familiarize yourself with it before you go out. You might also consider making it a part of your pack. Wild asparagus is common in many parts of North America, Europe and West Asia. It is very similar to asparagus that you find in your grocery store but has a lot thinner stalk. It typically resembles a cluster of green fingers. The mature plant is fern-like with red berries. The plant's flowers are small and green in color. Wild asparagus is most common between March and June. It is a great source of Vitamin C, thiamine and potassium. You can eat it raw or boil it. You'll most likely find it along ditches, fields, fences or at the base of ferns. These plants are known as cattails or punks in North America. They are known as bullrush or reedmace in Europe. They are typically found near freshwater rivers and ponds. They are tall plants that have a brown or bright yellow hot dog-shaped flower on the end. Most of the plant itself is edible. The best part of the plant is the stem near the bottom where the stalk is white. You can boil or eat them stem raw. Boil the leaves to eat them. If you want to eat the hot dog-looking part of the plant, you need to get it at the right time. The roots specifically, are very good sources of Vitamins A and B\nLucky for you, clovers are edible! They are typically found in an open grassy area and are better when boiled. It's best to eat the blossoms, but don't eat the brown blossoms. You'll want young and fresh white, pink or red ones. The leaves are also edible however, you'll want to look for young ones. The younger leaves are digestible raw in small amounts - half a cup or so. Older leaves will need to be cooked. You should be warned too that you'll never want to eat fermented clover leaves and clovers in warm climates can produce small amounts of cyanide so be careful. The chickweed is most common in temperate and arctic zones. The leaves are pretty thick and usually have small white flowers on the head. They are most common between May and July. Chickweed is very high in many vitamins and minerals. You can eat the leaves raw or boiled. The chickweed has a poisonous look-alike called spotted spurge. It grows close to the ground and can can even grow side by side with chickweed. Spurge exudes an acrid, white, milky sap when the leaves are cut. Chickweed does not. It should be pretty easy to identify dandelions. They are the ones that keep popping up in your perfect lawn! Your kids use them to draw with. Dandelion leaves have jagged edges, grow close to the ground and typically grow in bright areas.The great thing about them though is that they are entirely edible. You can eat the leaves while they are still young. The mature leaves aren’t bad but they will taste bitter. To get rid of the bitter taste, you can boil the leaves. You can also boil the roots before eating.\n\nAnd like many other edible leaves, these are best sautéed or stir-fried. 14. Grape Leaves\nWhether you grow grapes or find wild grapes while foraging, don’t overlook the large leaves. Grape leaves are a staple in Mediterranean dishes. They are delicious stuffed with rice, couscous, meat, cheese, or other creative fillings. 15. The Apple Core\nLook, I’m just going to come right out and say it – we’ve been lied to, there is no core. This idea of throwing out the core is nonsense. There are only two parts of an apple that aren’t edible – the seeds and the stem. And if you know how to eat an apple properly, you will quickly realize that you’ve been throwing out ¼ of tasty apple your whole life. To eat an apple properly, start at the bottom and work your way up the top. Spit out the seeds as you come to them. If you do it right, all you’re left with is a few seeds and a stem. We’ve got an impressive list of vegetables that multitask with other edible parts. Give some of these a try. You’ll help with the problem of food waste, and you just might find a new favorite veggie. I’m betting it will be the roasted cauliflower leaves.\n\nWe all have seen survival shows on television in which a survivalist goes hunting for a boar with a spear or fashions a bow and arrow from a tree branch. Sure it is good for ratings and makes for a good story, but how realistic is it? There are definitely times when hunting or trapping makes sense. However, there are more times that it does not. Hunting and trapping can be dangerous, time consuming, and hard work. Every time you take an action in a survival situation, you are taking a risk. You have to decide if the benefits of the action justify the calories you will expend and the physical risk you will take. If you spend all day hunting in the mountains and come up empty handed, was it worth it? If you go hog hunting with a spear and get your leg ripped off by the angry beast, was it worth it? I learned this lesson during my very first survival challenge. There were plenty of rabbits in the area, and I planned to hunt and trap them. I spent most of my day setting traps and stalking rabbits, but had no luck. I expended thousands of extra calories and gained nothing. At the end of the day I found some autumn olive berries, wood sorrel, and chickweed. It only took me about 30 minutes to collect the goods and almost no effort. My belly was not full, but I got many more calories than I had collected from my hunting and trapping efforts. In a survival situation, the easiest meal is always going to be wild edibles. It may not be the most filling meal or have the most calories, but with the right knowledge you can find wild edibles in just about any scenario with minimal effort. In this article I am going to cover ways to determine which plants are edible. I will also cover some specific edible plants that can be found in most of the world. Hopefully this information can help you find a meal if you are ever in need. Any time that you are uncertain about the identification of an edible plant, it must e tested before you consume it. There is a very simple process to help you ensure that you do not end up sick or dead. Step 1) Break up the plant and rub the juices on the inside of your wrist. Give it 20 minutes to see if you have any reaction. Step 2) Rub a bit on the inside of your lip. Give it 20 minutes to check for a reaction. Step 3) Chew up a small amount of the plant and spit out the pulp. Give it 20 minutes for a reaction. Step 4) Consume a small amount of the plant. Give it 20 minutes to check for a reaction. At this point you know that you are safe to eat the plant, but limit the amount. Even non-toxic plants can make you sick if consumed in large amounts. There are a few basic rules that can keep you out of trouble with wild edibles:\nThere are a few wild edibles that can be found just about anywhere in the world. These plants are easy to identify, and you probably already know what they look like. If in need, you can rely on these plants to get you by.

It consists of three round leaves and produces a white flower during the summer. The leaves and stems of clover are edible, and it can be found around the world.

Most wood sorrel has a yellow flower, but it can sometimes be found in other colors. The whole plant is edible and quite tasty. Plantain – This does not refer to the banana-like fruit, but instead the summertime leafy green. It has broad leaves and sometimes has tall stems with a seed head at the top.

So, it’s vital to prep these crops correctly earlier than you devour them. “You can actually use them as a substitute for spinach,” says Czerwony. “You have to rinse them off, boil them and then you’ll be able to scrape those little stingers off, and then you’ll be able to enjoy them.”\nThe acquainted weed will be greater than only a nuisance in your backyard. The leaves, root and petals of the dandelion can be utilized in numerous methods. Throw the leaves in a spring salad and even use the roots as an alternative to espresso. “You can use almost the entire dandelion,” says Czerwony. “The only thing that you can’t is the actual stem. It has a milky, bitter taste.”\nYou can acknowledge this plant by its brilliant yellow blossoms.

Czerwony factors out that whereas some might look comparable in shade, it’s higher to go for those that you realize for certain are suitable for eating. Look for the berries which are straightforward to determine, like:\n- Blueberries. With a blue-purple shade, these berries develop on bushes within the wild.

Similar in measurement to a daily cherry, these berries are extremely toxic if any a part of them is consumed. You can determine this plant by its darkish inexperienced leaves, orange or crimson berries and small, white flowers within the spring. What must you keep away from fully when foraging? There are some basic crops that it’s best to try to keep away from, particularly in case you’re a newbie. - Mushrooms. Generally, Czerwony recommends avoiding any and all mushrooms and fungi. While some are edible, the danger of selecting a toxic one is just too excessive. “Because there are so many varieties out there, you really have to be an expert,” she says. “I tell people to avoid them, just because there are enough other options out there to forage. With mushrooms, you can get liver toxicity, which can be fatal.”\n- Lily of the Valley. Similar trying to ramps (the wild onion), Lily of the Valley is a harmful plant that needs to be prevented. It will be recognized by its white blossoms and lengthy leaves. All elements of this plant are toxic and shouldn’t be consumed. Czerwony additionally recommends that as you’re foraging to maintain monitor of the crops you come throughout by taking a photograph. And particularly in case you suspect that you simply or somebody you’re with has consumed one thing toxic, remember to convey a photograph (or the plant itself) with you to the emergency room so applicable therapy will be initiated. Before making your approach into the woods, take a while to familiarize your self with the edible and toxic crops in your space.\n\nWhat Flowers Are Edible\nFlowers can make for a truly beautiful garden. It is one of Mother Nature’s most beautiful creations that man can never replicate. While flowers are mainly for decorative purposes, there are some plant species that can provide flowers you can eat. This is not something new.

They lined the old railroad tracks where I played as a kid; we called them tiger lilies though I don't know why and stomped over them on our quest for black caps. They seemed to be everywhere except my own back yard. That is, until this year. After discovering last summer through Hank Shaw's blog that these common daylilies are edible, I had to give them a try. I found a patch of plants and cooked up a few buds and tubers and declared them delicious. Color me surprised! I figured they'd make a fine addition to our summer menu so I begged a patch of them off of my in-laws to plant in my own yard. They were more than happy to let me dig up a load of them because as anyone who has these knows, they grow (and spread) like weeds. Our lily patch is pretty small this year but we've been able to get a few harvests of buds so far. In a year or two I should have enough that I can start thinning them out and then I'll be able to harvest the root tubers, which taste like fingerling potatoes. For now we're enjoying our buds sauteed in butter with a little salt. For me they taste a bit like a cross between a green bean and asparagus. Cooked just briefly they have a nice texture too. Seriously, did I mention, oh yum? I recently read that you can pickle the buds, and I suppose they'd be good deep fried, (because like, what isn't? ), or tossed in stir fry. The whole plant is edible actually and I've already promised to deep fry the flowers for my son who loves, and has been deprived of this year, squash blossoms.

Knowing what plants are edible and which ones are not can be the difference between life and death\nIdentifying edible plants\nThe first rule to follow is that if you can’t positively identify a plant, don’t eat it. A plant could be poisonous and if you identify it incorrectly, that could be a bad end. To complicate things, some plants are fine to eat when they are young but become poisonous later on in their growth. Some plants are poisonous during certain seasons. Others just have certain parts of the plants that are poisonous. While some of the plants below will not fit these descriptions, as a general rule of thumb, avoid plants that have:\n• spines, fine hairs or thorns\n• beans, bulbs or seeds inside the pod\n• a grainy head with pink, purple or black spurs\n• a three-leaf growing pattern\nWhere to find edible plants\nIf you are in a humid region, most of the plants will be in sunny areas.

Starting out as a rhythm and blues performer with a trickster’s manner, Cole crossed over to a white audience with “Straighten Up and Fly Right” in 1943 and then cemented his connection to white America with “The Christmas Song” (1946). We’ll see his appearances in several dramatic films as well as segments from The Nat King Cole Show (1956-57), the first series on network television to star an African American.\n“Scenes Through the Cinema Lens” is curated and hosted by Krin Gabbard, who teaches in the Jazz Studies program at Columbia University.

He successfully crossed over to appeal to white audiences with his 1943 song 'Straighten Up and Fly Right' and further strengthened this connection with 'The Christmas Song' in 1946.\n","answer":"In the 1940s, Nat King Cole's musical career evolved significantly, transitioning from a jazz pianist to a prominent singer. His career began with his trio, which played instrumental jazz. The group's popularity increased with the hit song \"Sweet Lorraine\" in 1940. As Cole's career progressed, he started incorporating more vocal elements into his music, leading to his first mainstream vocal hit, \"Straighten Up and Fly Right,\" in 1943. This song, based on a black folk tale, demonstrated the appeal of folk-based material to a wide audience. Cole's music gradually shifted from pure jazz to a blend of jazz and pop, aligning with the changing tastes of the era. This transition was pivotal in expanding his audience and solidifying his status as a versatile musician. His innovative lineup, featuring piano, guitar, and bass, set a new standard for jazz trios, influencing many musicians to follow suit. By the end of the decade, Nat King Cole's career had paved the way for his later success as a solo artist, where he became a major pop icon. His ability to adapt his music to the evolving musical landscape and his pioneering spirit in integrating jazz and pop music significantly contributed to his lasting impact on the music industry.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: Nat King Cole is one of the world’s greatest jazz legends. The records he made in the 1940s have been of major influence on jazz\nmusic. His impact on generations of pianists\nwas not just far-reaching: it was fundamental. Nat is often regarded as the man who made it possible for black musicians to break through in the U.S. music scene. He did not refuse to perform before segregated audiences, for he believed that goodwill and exhibition of his talent were more effective than formal protests in fighting racism. His approach was not always a success: he was a victim of several racial incidents throughout his life. 1919 – 1936\nNathaniel Adams Coles was born on March 17 1919* in Montgomery, Alabama. He was born in a poor family: his father, Edward James Coles sr., was a reverend, his mother Perlina Adams Coles was the choir director of her husband’s church. Even though Nat’s parents had thirteen children, only five of them made it to adulthood. Nat grew up with his brother Edward jr. and his two sisters, Eddie Mae and Evelyn. When Nat was four years old his family moved to Chicago where his father had been offered pastorship of the True Light Baptist Church. In Chicago his parents got two more boys, Issac and Lionel (better known as “Freddie”.) Nat was taught to play the piano at an early age by his mother. Perlina, determined to give her children a musical education, succeeded. Her four sons all became professional musicians. When Nat was 12 years old he regularly sung and played the organ in church. After he joined Wendell Phillips High School he was introduced to jazz music and was greatly enthusiastic about this new type of music: together with his brother Eddie he would explore the Chicago jazz scene whenever he could. In 1934 Nat organized a jazz quintet called “Nat Coles and his Royal Dukes”, as well as a 14-piece orchestra called “Rogues of Rhythm”. When Nat heard Earl Hines play one night, he was heavily impressed and driven to give his quintet a new, more rhythmic sound, much like Hines’. Later he’d say about Hines: \"It was his driving force that appealed to me ... I was just a kid and coming up, but I latched onto that new Hines style. Guess I still show the influence today.\" (-Down Beat, 1957). When Nat was 16 he joined Eddie’s band “Solid Swingers” and started performing at jazz joints throughout Chicago. It was in these joints that Nat gained his first bit of success. The (mere) success didn’t do much good to Nat’s educational career: he dropped out of High School in 1936. 1936 - 1940\nNot long after he turned 18, Nat married Nadine Robinson. They had met each other on the vaudeville “Shuffle Along”. Nadine was one of the show’s dancers, while Nat was a pianist in the vaudeville-orchestra. When the show ended the couple settled in Los Angeles. They didn’t have much money and in order to pay the rent Nat had to play the piano in local beer joints for little pay. After a year of hard work Cole’s talent was discovered by the owner of the famous Century Club, at that time the most popular hangout in L.A. for jazz musicians – Nat became a regular performer at this club. Around 1938 Nat was asked to form a quintet (that eventually became a trio as drummer Lee Young didn’t show up on the opening night.) After bassist Wesley Prince and guitarist Oscar Moore joined, the group performed at the Sewanee Inn, an L.A. nightclub. Owner of the nightclub, Bob Lewis, asked from Nat that he would carry a golden crown made of paper - this is how Nat got his nickname “King”. Nat soon got rid of the crown, but the band kept its name: the “King Cole Trio”. 1940 - 1950\nIn their early days, the King Cole Trio played instrumental jazz. After 1940 they gradually introduced vocals to their music**. December 1940 they had the opportunity to record for the Decca record company. They recorded the hit song “Sweet Lorraine” and the groups’ popularity increased dramatically. The King Cole Trio was a bit of an oddity in their days. The music scene was dominated by Big Bands and black musicians were rejected from popular clubs, racism still being very common in the early 1940s.\n\nWednesday, February 10, 2016\nNat King Cole (1919-1965) - Fly Right\nNat King Cole (1919-1965)\nStraighten Up and Fly Right (1943)\nNathaniel Adams Coles (March 17, 1919 - February 15, 1965), known professionally as Nat King Cole, was born in Montgomery, Alabama. His birth date, according to the World Almanac, was on Saint Patrick's Day in 1919; other sources have erroneously listed his birthdate as 1917. His father was a preacher in the Baptist church. His family moved to Chicago, Illinois, while he was still a child. There, his father became a minister; Nat's mother, Perlina, was the church organist. Nat learned to play the organ from his mother until the age of 12, when he began formal lessons. His first performance, at age four, was of Yes, We Have No Bananas. He learned not only jazz and gospel music, but European classical music as well, performing, as he said, \"from Johann Sebastian Bach to Sergei Rachmaninoff.\" So much for 20th-century music... The family lived in the Bronzeville neighborhood of Chicago. Nat would sneak out of the house and hang outside the clubs, listening to artists such as Louis Armstrong, Earl \"Fatha\" Hines, and Jimmie Noone. He participated in Walter Dyett's renowned music program at DuSable High School. Inspired by the playing of Earl Hines, Cole began his performing career in the mid 1930's while he was still a teenager, and adopted the name \"Nat Cole.\" His older brother, Eddie Coles, a bassist, soon joined Nat's band and they first recorded in 1936 under Eddie's name. They were also regular performers at clubs. In fact, Nat got his nickname \"King\" performing at one jazz club, a nickname presumably reinforced by the otherwise-unrelated nursery rhyme about Old King Cole. He was also a pianist in a national touring revival of ragtime and Broadway theatre legend, Eubie Blake's revue, \"Shuffle Along.\" When it suddenly failed in Long Beach, California, Cole decided to remain there. Nat Cole and three other musicians formed the \"King Cole Swingers\" in Long Beach and played in a number of local bars before getting a gig on the Long Beach Pike for US$90 per week. Nat married a dancer Megan Robinson, who was also with Shuffle Along, and moved to Los Angeles where he formed the Nat King Cole Trio. The trio consisted of Nat on piano, Oscar Moore on guitar, and Wesley Prince on double bass. The trio played in Los Angeles throughout the late 1930s and recorded many radio transcriptions. Nat's role was that of piano player and leader of the combo. It is a common misconception that Nat Cole's singing career did not start until a drunken barroom patron demanded that he sing \"Sweet Lorraine.\" In fact, Nat Cole has gone on record as saying that the fabricated story \"sounded good, so I just let it ride.\" In fact Nat Cole frequently sang in between instrumental numbers. Noticing that people started to request more vocal numbers, he obliged. Yet, the story of the insistent customer is not without merit. There was such a customer who did request a certain song one night, but a song that Nat did not know. Instead he sang \"Sweet Lorraine.\" The trio was tipped 15 cents for the performance, a nickel apiece (Nat King Cole: An Intimate Biography, Maria Cole with Louie Robinson, 1971). During World War II, Wesley Prince left the group and Cole replaced him with Johnny Miller. Miller would later be replaced by Charlie Harris in the 1950's. The King Cole Trio signed with the fledgling Capitol Records in 1943 and Cole stayed with the recording company for the rest of his career. Revenues from Cole's record sales fueled much of Capitol Records' success during this period, and are believed to have played a significant role in financing the distinctive Capitol Records building on Hollywood and Vine, in Los Angeles. Completed in 1956, it was the world's first circular office building and became known as \"the house that Nat built.\" Cole was considered a leading jazz pianist, appearing, for example, in the first Jazz at the Philharmonic concerts (credited on the Mercury Record labels as \"Shorty Nadine,\" apparently derived from the name of his wife at the time).\n\nHis revolutionary lineup of piano, guitar and bass in the time of the big bands became a popular set up for a jazz trio. It was emulated by many musicians, among them Art Tatum, Erroll Garner, Oscar Peterson, Ahmad Jamal, Tommy Flanagan and blues pianists Charles Brown and Ray Charles. He also performed as a pianist on sessions with Lester Young, Red Callender, and Lionel Hampton. The Page Cavanaugh Trio with the same set up as Cole came out of the chute about the same time, at the end of the war. Cole's first mainstream vocal hit was his 1943 recording of one of his compositions, \"Straighten Up and Fly Right,\" based on a black folk tale that his father had used as a theme for a sermon. Johnny Mercer invited him to record it for the fledgling Capitol Records label. It sold over 500,000 copies, and proved that folk-based material could appeal to a wide audience. Although Nat would never be considered a rocker, the song can be seen as anticipating the first rock and roll records. Indeed, Bo Diddley, who performed similar transformations of folk material, counted Cole as an influence. Beginning in the late 1940's, Cole began recording and performing more pop-oriented material for mainstream audiences, often accompanied by a string orchestra. His stature as a popular icon was cemented during this period by hits such as \"The Christmas Song\" (Cole recorded the tune four times: June 14, 1946 as a pure Trio recording; August 19, 1946 with an added string section; August 24, 1953; and again in 1961 for the double album, The Nat King Cole Story. This final version, recorded in stereo, is the one most often heard today. ), \"Nature Boy\" (1948), \"Mona Lisa\" (1950), \"Too Young\" (the #1 song in 1951), and his signature tune \"Unforgettable\" (1951). While this shift to pop music led some jazz critics and fans to accuse Cole of selling out, he never totally abandoned his jazz roots; as late as 1956, for instance, he recorded an all-jazz album, After Midnight. [Harold Arlen - It's Only a Paper Moon]\nThe change in musical tastes during the late 1950s meant that Cole's ballad singing did not sell well with younger listeners, despite a successful stab at rock n' roll with \"Send For Me\" (peaked at #6 pop). Along with his contemporaries Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett, Cole found that the pop singles chart had been almost entirely taken over by youth-oriented acts. In 1960, Nat's long-time collaborator Nelson Riddle left Capitol Records for Frank Sinatra's newly formed Reprise Records label. Riddle and Cole recorded one final hit album Wild Is Love, based on lyrics by Ray Rasch and Dotty Wayne. Cole later retooled the concept album into an off-Broadway show, I'm With You. Cole, a heavy smoker who would smoke as much as three packets of cigarettes a day, died of lung cancer on February 15, 1965, while still at the height of his singing career. The day before he died, he did a radio interview, stating: \"I am feeling better than ever. I think I've finally got this cancer licked.\" [8919 Courage \/ 8919 Nat King Cole \/ 8918 Bernstein]\n\nThe trio, however, was one of the first bands to be accepted to these “white” clubs. In 1941 the band went on a national tour. After touring for a few months they settled in New York where they performed at top jazz clubs. In 1942 Wesley Prince was drafted, he was replaced by Johnny Miller. With Miller the group moved back to Los Angeles where they did a series of performances at club “331”. One year later the trio was signed to Capitol Records. They recorded “Straighten Up and Fly Right”, which became a hit in 1944***. More hits the group made with Capitol in this period were “Get Your Kicks on Route 66\" and \"For Sentimental Reasons,\" amongst others. The late 1940s were a busy time for the trio. From 1946 till 1950 they filled the weekly radio program “Kraft Music Hall.” Together with pianist Eddy Duchin they gave young skillful artists the chance to reach a large audience. \"You have no idea how much satisfaction I got from the acceptance of the trio, because we opened the way for countless other small groups, units that before were strictly for cocktail lounges,\" Cole told Down Beat in 1957. In the same period the trio also played in a few movies, including “Breakfast in Hollywood”, “See my lawyer” and “The Stork Club.”\nIn 1946 Nat met the singer Maria Ellington (not related to The Duke, although she sang in his band for a short time) and fell in love with her. After divorcing Nadine he married Maria on March 28, 1948. Influenced by Maria, Nat radically moved away from jazz with the major hit “The Christmas Song” (December 1946.) “The Christmas Song” was the first song in which Nat sung rather than played the piano, with string section accompaniment. In 1947 Oscar Moore decided to leave the trio, Irving Ashby took his place. Nat more and more desired to become a mainstream artist rather than a jazz pianist. This was made clear in another major hit song: “Nature Boy” (1948.) 1950 - 1960\nNat’s first daughter, Natalie (nicknamed “Sweetie”) was born on February 6, 1950. A few months later Nat released the ballad “Mona Lisa” (that stayed on the charts for a record amount of weeks.) “Mona Lisa” permanently changed Nat’s career. The other members of the Cole King Trio had become Nat’s background music, this caused irritations and in 1955 the trio split up. Nat now gained great fame as a solo singer, many of his new fans didn’t even know he used to be a jazz pianist. During the 50’s he made success with \"Unforgettable,\" \"Too Young,\" \"Answer Me, My Love,\" and \"Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup.\" In 1956 Nat was asked to start an own TV show for NBC. This was quite an event: never before a major TV company had asked a Negro to host a show. The show was popular and got good ratings, but Nat never knew to find a sponsor. Businesses were afraid that white southern audiences would associate their products with a Negro. This caused the show to be cancelled after only one year of airtime. Nat did appear on the big screen another few times: in the movie “St. Louis Blues”(1958) for example, and in “The Nat King Cole Story”(1955), an autobiographic film. For a complete list of movies Nat appeared in, see the filmography below. Mid-fifties Nat and Maria adopted Maria’s sister’s daughter Carol, after both of Carol’s parents had died. In 1959 they adopted a boy whom they called Nat Kelly. Plagued by the popularity of Rock and Roll and upcoming artists like Johnny Mathis and Harry Belafonte, Nat’s career went a bit downhill in the late fifties. To prevent this he organized a touring concert show called “Sights and Sounds.” The show presented a group of young dancers and singers who called themselves the “Merry Young Souls.”\n1960 - 1965\nEven though Nat and Maria never thought they would get any more children of their own, in 1961 Maria got pregnant and gave birth to twins: Casey (named after baseball legend Casey Stengel) and Timolin. Nat’s career knew a revival in the early 1960s after he recorded the pop songs \"Ramblin' Rose\" and \"Those Lazy, Hazy, Crazy Days of Summer\" that both came on #1 in the American charts. Late 1964 Nat was diagnosed with lung cancer.\n\nAs both a singer and Jazz pianist of the highest caliber, Nat recorded literally thousands of songs, a staggering amount of which are well worth the listen. Over the years, there have been thousands of releases in a dazzling array of formats. If you are interested in or simply curious about Nat King Cole's music, this site is here as a handy reference! All Nat's recordings, best as I can figure it! You can find lists of tracks he recorded, as well as some information about when he recorded them, some commentary by yours truly and the original releases where applicable on albums and singles. A reference listing what information I may about the releases made during Nat's own lifetime. This section focuses on the reissues - Nat's recordings on CD and LP reissues. Tracks are listed, with some reviews, info and covers. Informal and unofficial discussions, comments about his recordings, and suggestions for finding the best of what's available now. Other topics of possible interest which may also be discussed include recording technology, the music business and other topics and performers contemporary with Nat. All this information is presented in a way which I hope will help you to make sense of it all. Some years back, about ooooh a generation ago, I was listening to a hits CD and liked one of the songs in particular. The CD notes said the track was by Nat King Cole and was from an album of his. I went online to learn more about the album and find out what else he might've recorded around that time. There were tons of \"hits\" on a search engine, a million places selling a million Nat King Cole compilations, but little useful info. As I came to enjoy more of his music, I looked further online and still didn't find much discussion about him. The situation hasn't improved all that much. So I've been trying to do something about that by making this site, which, by the way, is named after one of Nat's own instrumental compositions, A Pile 'O Cole. There are three formal discographies. Much of his recorded musical career is covered in the discographies included in the Mosaic Records and Bear Family Record box sets. The other option is in printed form from Roy Holmes. Either option is expensive and has a neccessarily limited context. Therefore, I set sights on attempting to make an informal discography online. It would be just little ole me doing it, with zero budget, very little spare time, no access to archives or Roy Holmes' work, and a partial (but not bad) collection of Nat's records. It won't ever be complete or accurate, but it can help some folks trying to make sense of the masses of issues and find the recordings they want as well as spread appreciation for Nat and his music. I'm slowly working on it in odd moments. If you can help, email me. Corrections, tips and donations ;) are gratefully welcomed. Likewise if you need information, inquiries are welcome. Please note that replies may take some time. I should clarify, as well, that I do not sell CDs nor provide any music in any form; and I am not in any way affiliated with the Nat King Cole estate nor Capitol \/ EMI. Opinions expressed are my own unless specifically noted and do not represent the views of Capitol \/ EMI nor the Nat King Cole estate. Nat King Cole's music is one of the pleasures of this world which we all can enjoy throughout our lives. His innate gentility, artistry and dignity is also an inspiration. If this site helps anyone to gain better awareness of his recordings and helps with access to them, then it's been worth all the work. - Still trying to straighten up and fly right, A Pile o' Cole\n\nDF: Well, the blues underlies jazz as a whole, I think. I really got interested in listening to jazz. My brother Mort had a wonderful jazz collection (he’s seven years older than I), and he was moving out of the house about the time I was getting into the piano. He showed me how to play the blues, how it was constructed. So I understood those principles of the I chord and the V chord. Mort was a pianist. Both older brothers played popular piano. They could play dominant sevenths, although they didn’t know that was what they were called. I could play the blues in any key, but I never ventured into the black keys a lot. I wanted to play just like Albert Ammons and Pete Johnson was the guy that I really thought was great. I didn’t start getting into other repertoire until I was well into high school. My brothers’ record collections with Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman were big influences. RV: Did your parents encourage your interest in music? DF: My parents were bewildered. When they heard me start to play bebop, they really thought I’d gone crazy. My Dad always impressed on me that music was a great thing to do for a hobby, but you gotta do something else to make a living. I subscribed to that in kind of a passive way. I knew I could play and I knew that’s what I wanted to do. I was most interested in classic jazz. I read Mezz Mezzrow’s book, Really the Blues. It was a book from the 1940s about the romance of being a jazz musician. When I met Marian McPartland decades later, she said that was the book that caught her attention and got her interested in jazz when she was living in England before she came over here. RV: Was there a specific teacher who inspired your growing musicianship? DF: I worked part time at the Columbia distribution center in those days. I met a guy Jimmy Mulcrone, a pianist who was working with me packaging records. At that time you could walk in to the department store and record an acetate record. I had a few of these I’d recorded playing boogie-woogie piano with my brother Mort singing like Joe Turner. I played our records for Jimmy and he said, “You can play, but I could show you some stuff.” I began to go to his house in northeast Minneapolis on Saturdays, a long streetcar ride for me. He taught me music theory in my middle teens, assigning me pop songs to learn. I caught on quickly and it all made sense to me, almost immediately. Then, he taught me how bebop musicians manipulated harmony. That’s what got me interested in contemporary jazz. That’s when I decided I wanted to be a bebopper. That’s when I began playing with other musicians. RV: It’s good to remember the moments and people that changed our lives. Who were you listening to at that juncture of enlightenment? DF: Up to that point, I liked Jelly Roll Morton, Teddy Wilson, Mel Powell, Art Tatum. I liked the two-fisted piano players. They were big stars. Nat Cole hit me hard; I was listening to his piano playing. RV: Oh yes, Nat was such a big influence in so many ways. The pianist \/ singer, Ray Sullenger, who nurtured my knowledge in Houston years back, sang in the Nat Cole \/ Mel Torme tradition. I always admired their understated brilliance. DF: Jimmy Mulcrone also introduced me to Bud Powell and Al Haig’s playing. I started playing with cats in high school ensembles and knew it was what I really wanted to do. We had combos and I started playing gigs. Usually the leader was a kid my age and would provide the arrangements. We copied songs off bebop records and made simple arrangements of pop songs. RV: What was the music of the day in your high school years? DF: Well, first it was the King Cole Trio, then he started calling himself Nat King Cole. It was the pop music of the day. On the radio in Minneapolis there was really good jazz programming two or three times a week. I got to hear Charlie Ventura and Jackie and Roy. I saw Charlie Parker play on the University of Minnesota campus and it knocked me out. He was big giant.\n\nFrank Sinatra transformed popular music. Often cited as the single finest interpreter of American standards, he influenced generations of vocalists such as Nat King Cole and Carmen McRae by focusing on phrasing and matching narrative nuance and emotional naturalism with amazing breathing control. In the 1930s, Sinatra starting bringing back \"old\" songs by such masters as Cole Porter while he was still a Big Band singer. He became a national institution in the '40s, and even though Ray Charles has praised the flawless technique of this Columbia period, Sinatra kept evolving. Starting in the '50s he concentrated on groundbreaking concept albums and a fresh Big Band sound with master arranger Nelson Riddle. Sinatra explored every nuance of emotion on these Capitol and Reprise albums and influenced the work of Ella Fitzgerald and Peggy Lee. Beginning in the '70s, when rock ruled, his voice and output became erratic but some brilliant work remains. Though Sinatra always viewed himself as a popular singer, jazz musicians hold his work in the highest esteem. Miles Davis and Lester Young often interpreted standards through his versions and avant-gardist John Zorn has said that in his own way, Frank Sinatra was as much a jazz improviser as Charlie Parker.\n\nYour assignment is to listen to five famous holiday songs. These are mostly songs and singers that, in their time, became a significant part of American culture. In large part, the song and singer became famous because of each other, and so these versions became famous--not just the song, and not just the singer. I want you to think about what makes a song and singer go beyond being famous to the point it becomes part of the larger culture. If you are uncomfortable with this assignment, please let me know and I will give you an alternative assignment to complete. I have posted these songs on a private page on my personal website because I can embed them directly. On CompassNet I can only make them so you can download them and I think this will be easier for you. 1. Choose FIVE songs from the list below. Don’t just choose the first five. Look around a little and find some that look fun or at least interesting. Listen to the songs. 2. After you decide which song you like best, answer the two questions I asked (there are two questions below each song). You only need to answer the questions for the song you liked most. You will need to Google and think a little to answer these questions, but the answers are available. 3. Pick the song you personally liked least. I want you to explain why it might have become popular. Why might other people have liked it? 4. Once you have done the required five songs, you may do more for extra credit. There are two options for extra credit. One: you can answer the two questions for more of the songs you listened to. OR, there is an extra credit section below. Follow the directions. I will give you two points of extra credit for every additional two questions you answer, or each of the compare\/contrast options you complete. The maximum you may earn in extra credit is ten points. This assignment is due by January 6, 2016. Five songs should not be hard if you start right away and do a little each day. If you wait until the end, it will be hard. So please don't procrastinate. I estimate each song will take you about 10 minutes to listen and then answer the questions. Have fun! I can think of far worse homework assignments. \"Believe\" Josh Groban\nThis song is not yet a classic. It came from a movie that didn't do all that well. But, every year I feel like I hear it more and more. I think it might be becoming a classic. Listen to the music and think of the way it makes you feel. Question 1: What sort of emotions and images does it call up in your mind? Question 2: Do you think this song will ever become a classic, like \"Frosty\" or \"Rudolph\"? Why or why not? (Be specific. \"Blue Christmas\" Elvis Presley\nElvis Presley was an enormously influential performer. Most young people in his era loved him. Many other people thought he was inspired by the devil.

Question 2: Who else helped with the performing and possibly the writing of this song? Question 2: John Lennon belonged to a famous musical group. What is that group?\n\n1940s in jazz\nIn the early 1940s in jazz, bebop emerged, led by Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk and others. It helped to shift jazz from danceable popular music towards a more challenging \"musician's music.\" Differing greatly from swing, early bebop divorced itself from dance music, establishing itself more as an art form but lessening its potential popular and commercial value. Since bebop was meant to be listened to, not danced to, it used faster tempos. Beboppers introduced new forms of chromaticism and dissonance into jazz; the dissonant tritone (or \"flatted fifth\") interval became the \"most important interval of bebop\" and players engaged in a more abstracted form of chord-based improvisation which used \"passing\" chords, substitute chords, and altered chords. The style of drumming shifted as well to a more elusive and explosive style, in which the ride cymbal was used to keep time, while the snare and bass drum were used for accents. This appealed to a more specialized audiences than earlier forms of jazz, with sophisticated harmonies, fast tempos and often virtuoso musicianship. Bebop musicians often used 1930s standards, especially those from Broadway musicals, as part of their repertoire. Among standards written by bebop musicians are Gillespie's \"Salt Peanuts\" (1941) and \"A Night in Tunisia\" (1942), Parker's \"Anthropology\" (1946), \"Yardbird Suite\" (1946) and \"Scrapple from the Apple\" (1947), and Monk's \"'Round Midnight\" (1944), which is currently the most recorded jazz standard composed by a jazz musician. An early 1940s style known as \"jumping the blues\" or jump blues used small combos, uptempo music, and blues chord progressions. Jump blues drew on boogie-woogie from the 1930s. Kansas City Jazz in the 1930s as exemplified by tenor saxophonist Lester Young marked the transition from big bands to the bebop influence of the 1940s. These divergences from the jazz mainstream of the time initially met with a divided, sometimes hostile response among fans and fellow musicians, especially established swing players, who bristled at the new harmonic sounds. To hostile critics, bebop seemed to be filled with \"racing, nervous phrases\". Despite the initial friction, by the 1950s bebop had become an accepted part of the jazz vocabulary. The most influential bebop musicians included saxophonist Charlie Parker, pianists Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk, trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie and Clifford Brown, and drummer Max Roach. The swing era lasted until the mid-1940s, and produced popular tunes such as Duke Ellington's \"Cotton Tail\" (1940) and Billy Strayhorn's \"Take the 'A' Train\" (1941). When the big bands struggled to keep going during World War II, a shift was happening in jazz in favor of smaller groups. Some swing era musicians, like Louis Jordan, later found popularity in a new kind of music, called \"rhythm and blues\", that would evolve into rock and roll in the 1950s. In the late 1940s there was a revival of \"Dixieland\" music, harkening back to the original contrapuntal New Orleans style. This was driven in large part by record company reissues of early jazz classics by the Oliver, Morton, and Armstrong bands of the 1930s. There were two populations of musicians involved in the revival. One group consisted of players who had begun their careers playing in the traditional style, and were either returning to it, or continuing what they had been playing all along, such as Bob Crosby's Bobcats, Max Kaminsky, Eddie Condon, and Wild Bill Davison. Most of this group were originally Midwesterners, although there were a small number of New Orleans musicians involved. The second population of revivalists consisted of young musicians such as the Lu Watters band. By the late 1940s, Louis Armstrong's Allstars band became a leading ensemble. Through the 1950s and 1960s, Dixieland was one of the most commercially popular jazz styles in the US, Europe, and Japan, although critics paid little attention to it.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, for example, a new simpler Art Deco style became popular in art, jewellery, graphic design, fashion and architecture, the aesthetics of which are more dictated by compositional design characteristic of straight lines rather than the flourishes and embellishments of the Art Nouveau period popular during the Ragtime Era. It was an era in which Jazz bands and their leaders took the stage wearing smart-looking tuxedos and suits and female singers donned au current fashions. Beginning with a trend in so-called “oriental numbers” describing the far-off lands that had perfectly suited the minor keys of early jazz; Jazz music would evolve into a carefully arranged and harmonised style of swing by 1935. By the end of the Jazz Era, Jazz music would transform from pop music phenomenon to the status of de facto American classical music and composers ranging from Duke Ellington to Thelonius Monk, Miles Davis to Charlie Parker are still renown for their compositions that transcend the relatively simple format of song. But not all music from the Jazz Era was explicitly jazzy. Traditional song styles of rural America like blues, country and folk music would get the commercial treatment and then transform to cultivated commercial pop song success. In the 1940s, there would be official charts measuring the nationwide popularity of songs; with R&B and Country charts documenting their respective commercial popularity by the end of the 1940s. While Jazz genre and styles associated with it are featured in the very name of the era, not everything released during this periods was about jazz. Old methods of music production and recording pioneered during the Ragtime Era would fall by the wayside throughout the Jazz Era as new technology developed for recording and delivering music to consumers and audiences. The old business model of Tin Pan Alley song plugging from the stage would fall out of favour by the 1930s, when the theatre business slumped during the Great Depression and particularly when radio broadcasting music and variety programmes flourished. Movies musicals coming from the studios of Los Angeles found a mass audience nearly as soon as movies featured sound in the late 1920s and songs found popularity after their inclusion in movies. During this time, music business celebrity would transfer from songwriter to popular recording star or band leaders. Arranged orchestras and their bandleaders would remain popular up until the mid 1940s, thereafter, a music industry awash in popular crooners took over the music market throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s. New record labels like Okeh, Capitol, Brunswick and Decca would come onto the market and challenge older established names like Victor and Columbia, some of these new labels releasing niche specialty music that would eventually find pop success. Record companies faced the changing realities of music broadcasting when radio and eventually television brought new music directly in the homes of Americans for free. But perhaps the greatest transformation of music industry during this era was the transformation from acoustic recording and playback to electronics. It was a time period in which new inventions like speakers, radio, microphones created a much higher fidelity music product than the acoustic methods of the phonograph. Throughout the Jazz Era, technological advancement continued to bring new products and recording techniques to the music market, but this advancement also brought changes in the music market when broadcasting began to delivery music directly into the home of potential music consumers. Just as interesting as it is to investigate the trends and changes in the music industry during the Jazz Era, it is also interesting to note who is recording the music and providing the product to consumers. Throughout the era, the home piano would become something of a relic and Americans would continue to opt for purchasing pre-recorded music rather than producing it themselves at home with sheet music. Obviously, the most associated musicians of the time were band leaders and the various orchestras of the jazz and swing periods. Also prominent throughout this period in relation to jazz proper was the “age of the Soloist”  in which talented instrumentalists and scat vocalists showed their skills by improvising on melodies, a staple of the early New Orleans Jazz scene going as far back as the 1890s.","passages":[{"passage":"Nat King Cole is one of the world’s greatest jazz legends. The records he made in the 1940s have been of major influence on jazz\nmusic. His impact on generations of pianists\nwas not just far-reaching: it was fundamental. Nat is often regarded as the man who made it possible for black musicians to break through in the U.S. music scene. He did not refuse to perform before segregated audiences, for he believed that goodwill and exhibition of his talent were more effective than formal protests in fighting racism. His approach was not always a success: he was a victim of several racial incidents throughout his life. 1919 – 1936\nNathaniel Adams Coles was born on March 17 1919* in Montgomery, Alabama. He was born in a poor family: his father, Edward James Coles sr., was a reverend, his mother Perlina Adams Coles was the choir director of her husband’s church. Even though Nat’s parents had thirteen children, only five of them made it to adulthood. Nat grew up with his brother Edward jr. and his two sisters, Eddie Mae and Evelyn. When Nat was four years old his family moved to Chicago where his father had been offered pastorship of the True Light Baptist Church. In Chicago his parents got two more boys, Issac and Lionel (better known as “Freddie”.) Nat was taught to play the piano at an early age by his mother. Perlina, determined to give her children a musical education, succeeded. Her four sons all became professional musicians. When Nat was 12 years old he regularly sung and played the organ in church. After he joined Wendell Phillips High School he was introduced to jazz music and was greatly enthusiastic about this new type of music: together with his brother Eddie he would explore the Chicago jazz scene whenever he could. In 1934 Nat organized a jazz quintet called “Nat Coles and his Royal Dukes”, as well as a 14-piece orchestra called “Rogues of Rhythm”. When Nat heard Earl Hines play one night, he was heavily impressed and driven to give his quintet a new, more rhythmic sound, much like Hines’. Later he’d say about Hines: \"It was his driving force that appealed to me ... I was just a kid and coming up, but I latched onto that new Hines style. Guess I still show the influence today.\" (-Down Beat, 1957). When Nat was 16 he joined Eddie’s band “Solid Swingers” and started performing at jazz joints throughout Chicago. It was in these joints that Nat gained his first bit of success. The (mere) success didn’t do much good to Nat’s educational career: he dropped out of High School in 1936. 1936 - 1940\nNot long after he turned 18, Nat married Nadine Robinson. They had met each other on the vaudeville “Shuffle Along”. Nadine was one of the show’s dancers, while Nat was a pianist in the vaudeville-orchestra. When the show ended the couple settled in Los Angeles. They didn’t have much money and in order to pay the rent Nat had to play the piano in local beer joints for little pay. After a year of hard work Cole’s talent was discovered by the owner of the famous Century Club, at that time the most popular hangout in L.A. for jazz musicians – Nat became a regular performer at this club. Around 1938 Nat was asked to form a quintet (that eventually became a trio as drummer Lee Young didn’t show up on the opening night.) After bassist Wesley Prince and guitarist Oscar Moore joined, the group performed at the Sewanee Inn, an L.A. nightclub. Owner of the nightclub, Bob Lewis, asked from Nat that he would carry a golden crown made of paper - this is how Nat got his nickname “King”. Nat soon got rid of the crown, but the band kept its name: the “King Cole Trio”. 1940 - 1950\nIn their early days, the King Cole Trio played instrumental jazz. After 1940 they gradually introduced vocals to their music**. December 1940 they had the opportunity to record for the Decca record company. They recorded the hit song “Sweet Lorraine” and the groups’ popularity increased dramatically. The King Cole Trio was a bit of an oddity in their days. The music scene was dominated by Big Bands and black musicians were rejected from popular clubs, racism still being very common in the early 1940s.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:2cb15f4a-7e7d-49a0-b6d8-bb71f013417f>"]},{"passage":"Wednesday, February 10, 2016\nNat King Cole (1919-1965) - Fly Right\nNat King Cole (1919-1965)\nStraighten Up and Fly Right (1943)\nNathaniel Adams Coles (March 17, 1919 - February 15, 1965), known professionally as Nat King Cole, was born in Montgomery, Alabama. His birth date, according to the World Almanac, was on Saint Patrick's Day in 1919; other sources have erroneously listed his birthdate as 1917. His father was a preacher in the Baptist church. His family moved to Chicago, Illinois, while he was still a child. There, his father became a minister; Nat's mother, Perlina, was the church organist. Nat learned to play the organ from his mother until the age of 12, when he began formal lessons. His first performance, at age four, was of Yes, We Have No Bananas. He learned not only jazz and gospel music, but European classical music as well, performing, as he said, \"from Johann Sebastian Bach to Sergei Rachmaninoff.\" So much for 20th-century music... The family lived in the Bronzeville neighborhood of Chicago. Nat would sneak out of the house and hang outside the clubs, listening to artists such as Louis Armstrong, Earl \"Fatha\" Hines, and Jimmie Noone. He participated in Walter Dyett's renowned music program at DuSable High School. Inspired by the playing of Earl Hines, Cole began his performing career in the mid 1930's while he was still a teenager, and adopted the name \"Nat Cole.\" His older brother, Eddie Coles, a bassist, soon joined Nat's band and they first recorded in 1936 under Eddie's name. They were also regular performers at clubs. In fact, Nat got his nickname \"King\" performing at one jazz club, a nickname presumably reinforced by the otherwise-unrelated nursery rhyme about Old King Cole. He was also a pianist in a national touring revival of ragtime and Broadway theatre legend, Eubie Blake's revue, \"Shuffle Along.\" When it suddenly failed in Long Beach, California, Cole decided to remain there. Nat Cole and three other musicians formed the \"King Cole Swingers\" in Long Beach and played in a number of local bars before getting a gig on the Long Beach Pike for US$90 per week. Nat married a dancer Megan Robinson, who was also with Shuffle Along, and moved to Los Angeles where he formed the Nat King Cole Trio. The trio consisted of Nat on piano, Oscar Moore on guitar, and Wesley Prince on double bass. The trio played in Los Angeles throughout the late 1930s and recorded many radio transcriptions. Nat's role was that of piano player and leader of the combo. It is a common misconception that Nat Cole's singing career did not start until a drunken barroom patron demanded that he sing \"Sweet Lorraine.\" In fact, Nat Cole has gone on record as saying that the fabricated story \"sounded good, so I just let it ride.\" In fact Nat Cole frequently sang in between instrumental numbers. Noticing that people started to request more vocal numbers, he obliged. Yet, the story of the insistent customer is not without merit. There was such a customer who did request a certain song one night, but a song that Nat did not know. Instead he sang \"Sweet Lorraine.\" The trio was tipped 15 cents for the performance, a nickel apiece (Nat King Cole: An Intimate Biography, Maria Cole with Louie Robinson, 1971). During World War II, Wesley Prince left the group and Cole replaced him with Johnny Miller. Miller would later be replaced by Charlie Harris in the 1950's. The King Cole Trio signed with the fledgling Capitol Records in 1943 and Cole stayed with the recording company for the rest of his career. Revenues from Cole's record sales fueled much of Capitol Records' success during this period, and are believed to have played a significant role in financing the distinctive Capitol Records building on Hollywood and Vine, in Los Angeles. Completed in 1956, it was the world's first circular office building and became known as \"the house that Nat built.\" Cole was considered a leading jazz pianist, appearing, for example, in the first Jazz at the Philharmonic concerts (credited on the Mercury Record labels as \"Shorty Nadine,\" apparently derived from the name of his wife at the time).","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:39a7065b-7e6d-4363-aedb-f6b019d59ff0>"]},{"passage":"His revolutionary lineup of piano, guitar and bass in the time of the big bands became a popular set up for a jazz trio. It was emulated by many musicians, among them Art Tatum, Erroll Garner, Oscar Peterson, Ahmad Jamal, Tommy Flanagan and blues pianists Charles Brown and Ray Charles. He also performed as a pianist on sessions with Lester Young, Red Callender, and Lionel Hampton. The Page Cavanaugh Trio with the same set up as Cole came out of the chute about the same time, at the end of the war. Cole's first mainstream vocal hit was his 1943 recording of one of his compositions, \"Straighten Up and Fly Right,\" based on a black folk tale that his father had used as a theme for a sermon. Johnny Mercer invited him to record it for the fledgling Capitol Records label. It sold over 500,000 copies, and proved that folk-based material could appeal to a wide audience. Although Nat would never be considered a rocker, the song can be seen as anticipating the first rock and roll records. Indeed, Bo Diddley, who performed similar transformations of folk material, counted Cole as an influence. Beginning in the late 1940's, Cole began recording and performing more pop-oriented material for mainstream audiences, often accompanied by a string orchestra. His stature as a popular icon was cemented during this period by hits such as \"The Christmas Song\" (Cole recorded the tune four times: June 14, 1946 as a pure Trio recording; August 19, 1946 with an added string section; August 24, 1953; and again in 1961 for the double album, The Nat King Cole Story. This final version, recorded in stereo, is the one most often heard today. ), \"Nature Boy\" (1948), \"Mona Lisa\" (1950), \"Too Young\" (the #1 song in 1951), and his signature tune \"Unforgettable\" (1951). While this shift to pop music led some jazz critics and fans to accuse Cole of selling out, he never totally abandoned his jazz roots; as late as 1956, for instance, he recorded an all-jazz album, After Midnight. [Harold Arlen - It's Only a Paper Moon]\nThe change in musical tastes during the late 1950s meant that Cole's ballad singing did not sell well with younger listeners, despite a successful stab at rock n' roll with \"Send For Me\" (peaked at #6 pop). Along with his contemporaries Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett, Cole found that the pop singles chart had been almost entirely taken over by youth-oriented acts. In 1960, Nat's long-time collaborator Nelson Riddle left Capitol Records for Frank Sinatra's newly formed Reprise Records label. Riddle and Cole recorded one final hit album Wild Is Love, based on lyrics by Ray Rasch and Dotty Wayne. Cole later retooled the concept album into an off-Broadway show, I'm With You. Cole, a heavy smoker who would smoke as much as three packets of cigarettes a day, died of lung cancer on February 15, 1965, while still at the height of his singing career. The day before he died, he did a radio interview, stating: \"I am feeling better than ever. I think I've finally got this cancer licked.\" [8919 Courage \/ 8919 Nat King Cole \/ 8918 Bernstein]","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:39a7065b-7e6d-4363-aedb-f6b019d59ff0>"]},{"passage":"The trio, however, was one of the first bands to be accepted to these “white” clubs. In 1941 the band went on a national tour. After touring for a few months they settled in New York where they performed at top jazz clubs. In 1942 Wesley Prince was drafted, he was replaced by Johnny Miller. With Miller the group moved back to Los Angeles where they did a series of performances at club “331”. One year later the trio was signed to Capitol Records. They recorded “Straighten Up and Fly Right”, which became a hit in 1944***. More hits the group made with Capitol in this period were “Get Your Kicks on Route 66\" and \"For Sentimental Reasons,\" amongst others. The late 1940s were a busy time for the trio. From 1946 till 1950 they filled the weekly radio program “Kraft Music Hall.” Together with pianist Eddy Duchin they gave young skillful artists the chance to reach a large audience. \"You have no idea how much satisfaction I got from the acceptance of the trio, because we opened the way for countless other small groups, units that before were strictly for cocktail lounges,\" Cole told Down Beat in 1957. In the same period the trio also played in a few movies, including “Breakfast in Hollywood”, “See my lawyer” and “The Stork Club.”\nIn 1946 Nat met the singer Maria Ellington (not related to The Duke, although she sang in his band for a short time) and fell in love with her. After divorcing Nadine he married Maria on March 28, 1948. Influenced by Maria, Nat radically moved away from jazz with the major hit “The Christmas Song” (December 1946.) “The Christmas Song” was the first song in which Nat sung rather than played the piano, with string section accompaniment. In 1947 Oscar Moore decided to leave the trio, Irving Ashby took his place. Nat more and more desired to become a mainstream artist rather than a jazz pianist. This was made clear in another major hit song: “Nature Boy” (1948.) 1950 - 1960\nNat’s first daughter, Natalie (nicknamed “Sweetie”) was born on February 6, 1950. A few months later Nat released the ballad “Mona Lisa” (that stayed on the charts for a record amount of weeks.) “Mona Lisa” permanently changed Nat’s career. The other members of the Cole King Trio had become Nat’s background music, this caused irritations and in 1955 the trio split up. Nat now gained great fame as a solo singer, many of his new fans didn’t even know he used to be a jazz pianist. During the 50’s he made success with \"Unforgettable,\" \"Too Young,\" \"Answer Me, My Love,\" and \"Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup.\" In 1956 Nat was asked to start an own TV show for NBC. This was quite an event: never before a major TV company had asked a Negro to host a show. The show was popular and got good ratings, but Nat never knew to find a sponsor. Businesses were afraid that white southern audiences would associate their products with a Negro. This caused the show to be cancelled after only one year of airtime. Nat did appear on the big screen another few times: in the movie “St. Louis Blues”(1958) for example, and in “The Nat King Cole Story”(1955), an autobiographic film. For a complete list of movies Nat appeared in, see the filmography below. Mid-fifties Nat and Maria adopted Maria’s sister’s daughter Carol, after both of Carol’s parents had died. In 1959 they adopted a boy whom they called Nat Kelly. Plagued by the popularity of Rock and Roll and upcoming artists like Johnny Mathis and Harry Belafonte, Nat’s career went a bit downhill in the late fifties. To prevent this he organized a touring concert show called “Sights and Sounds.” The show presented a group of young dancers and singers who called themselves the “Merry Young Souls.”\n1960 - 1965\nEven though Nat and Maria never thought they would get any more children of their own, in 1961 Maria got pregnant and gave birth to twins: Casey (named after baseball legend Casey Stengel) and Timolin. Nat’s career knew a revival in the early 1960s after he recorded the pop songs \"Ramblin' Rose\" and \"Those Lazy, Hazy, Crazy Days of Summer\" that both came on #1 in the American charts. Late 1964 Nat was diagnosed with lung cancer.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:2cb15f4a-7e7d-49a0-b6d8-bb71f013417f>"]},{"passage":"As both a singer and Jazz pianist of the highest caliber, Nat recorded literally thousands of songs, a staggering amount of which are well worth the listen.

All this information is presented in a way which I hope will help you to make sense of it all. Some years back, about ooooh a generation ago, I was listening to a hits CD and liked one of the songs in particular. The CD notes said the track was by Nat King Cole and was from an album of his. I went online to learn more about the album and find out what else he might've recorded around that time. There were tons of \"hits\" on a search engine, a million places selling a million Nat King Cole compilations, but little useful info. As I came to enjoy more of his music, I looked further online and still didn't find much discussion about him. The situation hasn't improved all that much. So I've been trying to do something about that by making this site, which, by the way, is named after one of Nat's own instrumental compositions, A Pile 'O Cole. There are three formal discographies. Much of his recorded musical career is covered in the discographies included in the Mosaic Records and Bear Family Record box sets. The other option is in printed form from Roy Holmes. Either option is expensive and has a neccessarily limited context. Therefore, I set sights on attempting to make an informal discography online. It would be just little ole me doing it, with zero budget, very little spare time, no access to archives or Roy Holmes' work, and a partial (but not bad) collection of Nat's records. It won't ever be complete or accurate, but it can help some folks trying to make sense of the masses of issues and find the recordings they want as well as spread appreciation for Nat and his music.

I really got interested in listening to jazz. My brother Mort had a wonderful jazz collection (he’s seven years older than I), and he was moving out of the house about the time I was getting into the piano. He showed me how to play the blues, how it was constructed. So I understood those principles of the I chord and the V chord. Mort was a pianist. Both older brothers played popular piano. They could play dominant sevenths, although they didn’t know that was what they were called. I could play the blues in any key, but I never ventured into the black keys a lot. I wanted to play just like Albert Ammons and Pete Johnson was the guy that I really thought was great. I didn’t start getting into other repertoire until I was well into high school. My brothers’ record collections with Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman were big influences. RV: Did your parents encourage your interest in music? DF: My parents were bewildered. When they heard me start to play bebop, they really thought I’d gone crazy. My Dad always impressed on me that music was a great thing to do for a hobby, but you gotta do something else to make a living. I subscribed to that in kind of a passive way. I knew I could play and I knew that’s what I wanted to do. I was most interested in classic jazz. I read Mezz Mezzrow’s book, Really the Blues. It was a book from the 1940s about the romance of being a jazz musician. When I met Marian McPartland decades later, she said that was the book that caught her attention and got her interested in jazz when she was living in England before she came over here. RV: Was there a specific teacher who inspired your growing musicianship? DF: I worked part time at the Columbia distribution center in those days. I met a guy Jimmy Mulcrone, a pianist who was working with me packaging records. At that time you could walk in to the department store and record an acetate record. I had a few of these I’d recorded playing boogie-woogie piano with my brother Mort singing like Joe Turner. I played our records for Jimmy and he said, “You can play, but I could show you some stuff.” I began to go to his house in northeast Minneapolis on Saturdays, a long streetcar ride for me. He taught me music theory in my middle teens, assigning me pop songs to learn. I caught on quickly and it all made sense to me, almost immediately. Then, he taught me how bebop musicians manipulated harmony. That’s what got me interested in contemporary jazz. That’s when I decided I wanted to be a bebopper. That’s when I began playing with other musicians. RV: It’s good to remember the moments and people that changed our lives. Who were you listening to at that juncture of enlightenment? DF: Up to that point, I liked Jelly Roll Morton, Teddy Wilson, Mel Powell, Art Tatum. I liked the two-fisted piano players. They were big stars. Nat Cole hit me hard; I was listening to his piano playing. RV: Oh yes, Nat was such a big influence in so many ways. The pianist \/ singer, Ray Sullenger, who nurtured my knowledge in Houston years back, sang in the Nat Cole \/ Mel Torme tradition. I always admired their understated brilliance. DF: Jimmy Mulcrone also introduced me to Bud Powell and Al Haig’s playing. I started playing with cats in high school ensembles and knew it was what I really wanted to do. We had combos and I started playing gigs. Usually the leader was a kid my age and would provide the arrangements. We copied songs off bebop records and made simple arrangements of pop songs. RV: What was the music of the day in your high school years? DF: Well, first it was the King Cole Trio, then he started calling himself Nat King Cole. It was the pop music of the day. On the radio in Minneapolis there was really good jazz programming two or three times a week. I got to hear Charlie Ventura and Jackie and Roy. I saw Charlie Parker play on the University of Minnesota campus and it knocked me out.

Often cited as the single finest interpreter of American standards, he influenced generations of vocalists such as Nat King Cole and Carmen McRae by focusing on phrasing and matching narrative nuance and emotional naturalism with amazing breathing control. In the 1930s, Sinatra starting bringing back \"old\" songs by such masters as Cole Porter while he was still a Big Band singer. He became a national institution in the '40s, and even though Ray Charles has praised the flawless technique of this Columbia period, Sinatra kept evolving. Starting in the '50s he concentrated on groundbreaking concept albums and a fresh Big Band sound with master arranger Nelson Riddle. Sinatra explored every nuance of emotion on these Capitol and Reprise albums and influenced the work of Ella Fitzgerald and Peggy Lee. Beginning in the '70s, when rock ruled, his voice and output became erratic but some brilliant work remains.

These are mostly songs and singers that, in their time, became a significant part of American culture. In large part, the song and singer became famous because of each other, and so these versions became famous--not just the song, and not just the singer. I want you to think about what makes a song and singer go beyond being famous to the point it becomes part of the larger culture. If you are uncomfortable with this assignment, please let me know and I will give you an alternative assignment to complete. I have posted these songs on a private page on my personal website because I can embed them directly. On CompassNet I can only make them so you can download them and I think this will be easier for you. 1. Choose FIVE songs from the list below. Don’t just choose the first five. Look around a little and find some that look fun or at least interesting. Listen to the songs. 2. After you decide which song you like best, answer the two questions I asked (there are two questions below each song). You only need to answer the questions for the song you liked most. You will need to Google and think a little to answer these questions, but the answers are available. 3. Pick the song you personally liked least. I want you to explain why it might have become popular. Why might other people have liked it? 4. Once you have done the required five songs, you may do more for extra credit. There are two options for extra credit. One: you can answer the two questions for more of the songs you listened to. OR, there is an extra credit section below. Follow the directions. I will give you two points of extra credit for every additional two questions you answer, or each of the compare\/contrast options you complete. The maximum you may earn in extra credit is ten points. This assignment is due by January 6, 2016. Five songs should not be hard if you start right away and do a little each day. If you wait until the end, it will be hard. So please don't procrastinate. I estimate each song will take you about 10 minutes to listen and then answer the questions. Have fun! I can think of far worse homework assignments. \"Believe\" Josh Groban\nThis song is not yet a classic. It came from a movie that didn't do all that well. But, every year I feel like I hear it more and more. I think it might be becoming a classic. Listen to the music and think of the way it makes you feel. Question 1: What sort of emotions and images does it call up in your mind? Question 2: Do you think this song will ever become a classic, like \"Frosty\" or \"Rudolph\"? Why or why not? (Be specific. \"Blue Christmas\" Elvis Presley\nElvis Presley was an enormously influential performer. Most young people in his era loved him. Many other people thought he was inspired by the devil. Today, some people still love him, others think he is incredibly tacky. Listen to this song and tell me what you think. Question 1: Do you like his voice? Why or why not? Question 2: What was the nickname people gave Elvis Presley? The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire) Nat King Cole\nNat King Cole is said to have had one of the smoothest voices ever. He has a famous daughter who you might have heard sing on the radio. Question 1: What presidents consulted with Nat King Cole? Question 2: What caused Cole's death? \"Frosty the Snowman\" Jimmy Durante\nIf you've seen the cartoon version of Frosty the Snowman, you've heard Jimmy Durante sing this song. Durante was another popular performer in his day. He started out performing in vaudeville singing, dancing, and doing comedy. If you listen, though, you can tell he doesn't have the nicest, smoothest voice. Question 1: Who was the original artist to record this song? Question 2: What was Jimmy Durante's nickname and to what did it refer? \"The Most Wonderful Time of the Year\" Andy Williams\nAt one time, Andy Williams received the largest contract a recording artist had ever earned before. He performed a song for a movie that became famous and became his theme song. Question 1: What was that song? Question 2: At which famous politician's funeral did Williams sing? \"Happy Xmas (War is Over)\" John Lennon\nQuestion 1: Explain what historical even this song is connected to? Question 2: Who else helped with the performing and possibly the writing of this song? Question 2: John Lennon belonged to a famous musical group. What is that group?","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:f23ea9fe-aec6-45b7-a218-02d08000af10>"]},{"passage":"1940s in jazz\nIn the early 1940s in jazz, bebop emerged, led by Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk and others. It helped to shift jazz from danceable popular music towards a more challenging \"musician's music.\" Differing greatly from swing, early bebop divorced itself from dance music, establishing itself more as an art form but lessening its potential popular and commercial value. Since bebop was meant to be listened to, not danced to, it used faster tempos. Beboppers introduced new forms of chromaticism and dissonance into jazz; the dissonant tritone (or \"flatted fifth\") interval became the \"most important interval of bebop\" and players engaged in a more abstracted form of chord-based improvisation which used \"passing\" chords, substitute chords, and altered chords. The style of drumming shifted as well to a more elusive and explosive style, in which the ride cymbal was used to keep time, while the snare and bass drum were used for accents. This appealed to a more specialized audiences than earlier forms of jazz, with sophisticated harmonies, fast tempos and often virtuoso musicianship. Bebop musicians often used 1930s standards, especially those from Broadway musicals, as part of their repertoire. Among standards written by bebop musicians are Gillespie's \"Salt Peanuts\" (1941) and \"A Night in Tunisia\" (1942), Parker's \"Anthropology\" (1946), \"Yardbird Suite\" (1946) and \"Scrapple from the Apple\" (1947), and Monk's \"'Round Midnight\" (1944), which is currently the most recorded jazz standard composed by a jazz musician. An early 1940s style known as \"jumping the blues\" or jump blues used small combos, uptempo music, and blues chord progressions. Jump blues drew on boogie-woogie from the 1930s. Kansas City Jazz in the 1930s as exemplified by tenor saxophonist Lester Young marked the transition from big bands to the bebop influence of the 1940s. These divergences from the jazz mainstream of the time initially met with a divided, sometimes hostile response among fans and fellow musicians, especially established swing players, who bristled at the new harmonic sounds. To hostile critics, bebop seemed to be filled with \"racing, nervous phrases\". Despite the initial friction, by the 1950s bebop had become an accepted part of the jazz vocabulary. The most influential bebop musicians included saxophonist Charlie Parker, pianists Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk, trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie and Clifford Brown, and drummer Max Roach. The swing era lasted until the mid-1940s, and produced popular tunes such as Duke Ellington's \"Cotton Tail\" (1940) and Billy Strayhorn's \"Take the 'A' Train\" (1941). When the big bands struggled to keep going during World War II, a shift was happening in jazz in favor of smaller groups. Some swing era musicians, like Louis Jordan, later found popularity in a new kind of music, called \"rhythm and blues\", that would evolve into rock and roll in the 1950s. In the late 1940s there was a revival of \"Dixieland\" music, harkening back to the original contrapuntal New Orleans style. This was driven in large part by record company reissues of early jazz classics by the Oliver, Morton, and Armstrong bands of the 1930s. There were two populations of musicians involved in the revival. One group consisted of players who had begun their careers playing in the traditional style, and were either returning to it, or continuing what they had been playing all along, such as Bob Crosby's Bobcats, Max Kaminsky, Eddie Condon, and Wild Bill Davison. Most of this group were originally Midwesterners, although there were a small number of New Orleans musicians involved. The second population of revivalists consisted of young musicians such as the Lu Watters band. By the late 1940s, Louis Armstrong's Allstars band became a leading ensemble. Through the 1950s and 1960s, Dixieland was one of the most commercially popular jazz styles in the US, Europe, and Japan, although critics paid little attention to it.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:f7ffb6af-5c48-4ad8-902e-4329f2a11116>"]},{"passage":"During the 1920s and 1930s, for example, a new simpler Art Deco style became popular in art, jewellery, graphic design, fashion and architecture, the aesthetics of which are more dictated by compositional design characteristic of straight lines rather than the flourishes and embellishments of the Art Nouveau period popular during the Ragtime Era. It was an era in which Jazz bands and their leaders took the stage wearing smart-looking tuxedos and suits and female singers donned au current fashions. Beginning with a trend in so-called “oriental numbers” describing the far-off lands that had perfectly suited the minor keys of early jazz; Jazz music would evolve into a carefully arranged and harmonised style of swing by 1935. By the end of the Jazz Era, Jazz music would transform from pop music phenomenon to the status of de facto American classical music and composers ranging from Duke Ellington to Thelonius Monk, Miles Davis to Charlie Parker are still renown for their compositions that transcend the relatively simple format of song. But not all music from the Jazz Era was explicitly jazzy. Traditional song styles of rural America like blues, country and folk music would get the commercial treatment and then transform to cultivated commercial pop song success. In the 1940s, there would be official charts measuring the nationwide popularity of songs; with R&B and Country charts documenting their respective commercial popularity by the end of the 1940s. While Jazz genre and styles associated with it are featured in the very name of the era, not everything released during this periods was about jazz. Old methods of music production and recording pioneered during the Ragtime Era would fall by the wayside throughout the Jazz Era as new technology developed for recording and delivering music to consumers and audiences. The old business model of Tin Pan Alley song plugging from the stage would fall out of favour by the 1930s, when the theatre business slumped during the Great Depression and particularly when radio broadcasting music and variety programmes flourished. Movies musicals coming from the studios of Los Angeles found a mass audience nearly as soon as movies featured sound in the late 1920s and songs found popularity after their inclusion in movies. During this time, music business celebrity would transfer from songwriter to popular recording star or band leaders. Arranged orchestras and their bandleaders would remain popular up until the mid 1940s, thereafter, a music industry awash in popular crooners took over the music market throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s. New record labels like Okeh, Capitol, Brunswick and Decca would come onto the market and challenge older established names like Victor and Columbia, some of these new labels releasing niche specialty music that would eventually find pop success. Record companies faced the changing realities of music broadcasting when radio and eventually television brought new music directly in the homes of Americans for free. But perhaps the greatest transformation of music industry during this era was the transformation from acoustic recording and playback to electronics. It was a time period in which new inventions like speakers, radio, microphones created a much higher fidelity music product than the acoustic methods of the phonograph. Throughout the Jazz Era, technological advancement continued to bring new products and recording techniques to the music market, but this advancement also brought changes in the music market when broadcasting began to delivery music directly into the home of potential music consumers. Just as interesting as it is to investigate the trends and changes in the music industry during the Jazz Era, it is also interesting to note who is recording the music and providing the product to consumers. Throughout the era, the home piano would become something of a relic and Americans would continue to opt for purchasing pre-recorded music rather than producing it themselves at home with sheet music. Obviously, the most associated musicians of the time were band leaders and the various orchestras of the jazz and swing periods. Also prominent throughout this period in relation to jazz proper was the “age of the Soloist”  in which talented instrumentalists and scat vocalists showed their skills by improvising on melodies, a staple of the early New Orleans Jazz scene going as far back as the 1890s.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e580519a-3e8b-42e9-8ae8-b97481ceabcf>"]}]}

Over the past week, I have had the privilege to speaking to some students who I have not spoken to face-to-face about themselves musically. Throughout these interviews, I have made some interesting discoveries and learned more about each student’s affiliation to music before their post-secondary education and what music means to them on a personal level. The three candidates I have spoken to have had some sort of background of music in their early life, which is what I have focused on in these interviews. My first student I conversed with was one of my high school friends, Abbey Anthony, who is currently a 2nd year nursing student at Western University. Both Abbey and I attended the same elementary and secondary school (St. Mary’s Choir and Catholic Central High School respectively), although she was a grade higher than me. Because of that, we both were in the same music program throughout our time in school, having more or less the same musical experience. Within our conversation, I asked her if there was a time that music was of great importance in her life, and she responded, saying that high school was where she found that music was very important to deal with all of her problems. We moved on to talking about a mentor who inspired her through music, and strangely enough, we both had the same role model in mind; Donald (Duck) Sills. “He was phenomenal, and just made me see music in a whole different way.” I felt that Don was one of the reasons why Abbey feels music has such a great importance in today’s society. In particular, we talked more about how much she has learned from being under Don’s tutelage and what she felt about he taught music. “I definitely enjoyed [his teaching style] because a big thing for me with teachers is being personable and sharing with them. He has this remarkable way of both being very personable and [that] you feel like you’re on a same sharing basis, and I think that’s something that’s hard to do; to find that right balance.”\nWe also talked about her studies in university and her decision to focus on nursing rather than music. Despite being accepted into some schools for music, she felt that nursing was what she really wanted to go into. “It often crosses my mind of what would have happened if I have gone into music.” From this, I saw that she enjoyed the experience of music in high school, but that her aspirations of becoming a nurse were in the way of continuing into music However, I was pleased to know that if it were easier to take a double-major with music and nursing, she would not hesitate to go that route! The next student I talked to was one that I have not seen face-to-face in a few months. Stewart Finlay was one of my best friends growing up throughout elementary school and high school. Currently, he studies at Sault College in Sault St. Marie for aviation studies. Similar to Abbey, Stewart and I grew up having the same learning experience in music, being in the same grade, classes, ensembles, and having the same music teachers. One of the big questions I asked him in our interview was the importance of music to him. He says that everyone is exposed to music and that you can find it wherever you go. “It’s such an omnipresent being that just gives you energy and is an assistant to you to make you feel good about doing things.” I assumed the reason that music was significant to his life was due to his musical background. Stewart told me about the influence of his dad was one of the things that inspired him to study music. “My dad was in a choir school when he was younger, and him being involved in music and listening to all of that music made me listen to the music he listens to. And it just had a big impact on me in having all that music experience.” To no surprise, Don was another figure in his life that influenced his musical background. “His teaching style was just excellent. He’s very knowledgeable, and efficient.”\nDespite his musical background, Stewart had decided to go into the study of aviation. One of the driving factors being the influence of his dad and aviation. “I feel that my dad had a big impact on me for aviation because he was exposed to planes and made me want to fly planes. If I’m being honest, if I didn’t pursue a career in aviation, I’d probably be doing something in music because of my background and experience in music.” I felt that this made me feel content that people like Stewart would like to study more about music if it were possible in their academic schedule.\n\n\"I would teach children music, physics and philosophy; but most importantly music, for the patterns in music and all the arts are the keys to learning.\" Our Music Department is founded on the belief that all students are musicians, they just need to find their musical voice, whether it is through singing or an instrument, composing their own music, exploring elements of music technology or sharing their own interpretations of the music they hear.Our curriculum covers a range of skills and styles, providing the opportunity for the less-experienced to discover what music really is, while still challenging those who have been studying an instrument for many years. All topics include some elements of listening, performing and composing, and all students are expected to be familiar with basic music notation by the end of Year 5. The majority of learning is done through practical tasks as the more explicit, intensive study of music history and theory can be found in the exam years. We encourage all students to remember that being ‘musical’ is not simply about learning an instrument. It involves a range of skills that can be developed through regular practice. - Early Years and Pre-Prep\n- Senior School\n- Sixth Form\n- Outside the Classroom\n- Individual Instrumental and Singing Lessons\nStudents engage in music learning from the very beginning of their Harrow journey. The first steps involve a variety of games to develop their co-ordination skills and engage their imaginations. As their journey progresses they are introduced to a variety of instruments and have the opportunity to explore different sounds. This continues as they progress through Pre-Prep, with increasing levels of musical vocabulary and the introduction of music notation. Students develop greater independence through their time in Prep, with an increasing emphasis on group work and research-influenced performing and composing. Students also have the opportunity to work with instrumental teachers during this time, for example through group lessons of guitars and wind instruments in Year 8. Students in Prep use an increasing amount of technology, particularly Garageband, to widen their skill base. Students in Year 9 continue to develop their understanding through group work and class discussion, using more complex vocabulary and making more complex connections between pieces and styles. They also learn to use Sibelius software at this stage.In Years 10 and 11, the CIE GCSE course is equipped to develop the musical skills of each student, with the final result being derived from coursework (30% performing and 30% composing) and a general listening exam (40%). The CIE AS\/A2 course combines musical analysis, harmony and counterpoint, composing, performing as well as looking at music and musicians from a wider context. Students study a selection of contrasting set works from the Classical Period as well as a topic of ‘Picturing Music’. They also have options regarding the amount of performing and composing they do, opening the A-level to a wider range of students. At A2, students do not take a final exam. They may choose either a performing or composing option, along with an investigative report. We offer a wide ranging extra-curricular music programme, both during Enrichment Activity slots and also lunchtimes. Students of all ages and abilities can find something to engage their musical skills. These feed into the whole school concerts, which take place at Christmas and in the late spring. Students are also encouraged and supported in setting up their own ensembles and have many opportunities to demonstrate their skills throughout the year. As a member of FOBISIA, we have taken part in a number of their festivals, including the Primary Carnival, and acting as hosts for the older students’ Music Festival. Our older students also perform in the wider community, particularly at Christmas where they have become a fixture at the Ritz Carlton Hotel Christmas celebrations. - Pre-Prep Singers (Years 2-5)\n- Show Choir (Years 6-13)\n- Apri Canentes (Years 10-13 audition only)\n- Staff Choir\n- String Group\n- Chinese Drumming\n- Flute Choir (lunchtime activity)\n- Guitar Club (lunchtime activity)\n- Reed Club (lunchtime activity)\n- Ukulele Club (lunchtime activity)\n- Pre-Prep Pans (lunchtime activity)\n- Steelers (Year 6 – 9, beginner to intermediate steel pans)\n- Pantastic (Years 7 – 13 advanced steel pans)\nWe also offer individual 30 minute lessons on a wide variety of instruments. Our team of instrumental teachers are very experienced.\n\nSteelband music in schools is now an integral part of the steelpan culture throughout the United Kingdom (UK). This section aims to support some of the many UK steelbands that have contributed to music education and many other aspects of their band member's educational development by playing steelpans. Each feature is unique in its own way, illustrating the different reasons why the steelbands were formed and how they are run. However, some common themes that are highlighted in each feature are:\n- Encouraging pupils to work independently or in a group. - Sharing experiences and presenting basic skills to others. - Gaining opportunities to engage in cultural events. - Exploring music and its role within society as a possible career. The features will hopefully encourage those wanting to start a steelband and newly developing steelbands to take a closer look at the various achievements accomplished, and to implement elements that may enhance their own projects. If you have a steelband and would like to share your experiences, please email your details\n\nYear 7 and 8\nLearning Music in our College 'makes the difference'\nAll Year 7 students participate in 'Classroom Music—Training Band' program where all students are provided (for one year) a concert style instrument for the Band class. They perform and study various musical styles and basic playing techniques. This subject is not a substitute for learning or studying a major musical instrument of student own choice within our Instrumental Music Program. Technical skills that are covered are very basic and classes involve general classroom music themes, too. All students are required to perform at the end of year concert as part of their major assessment. All students are welcome to join any of the major ensembles that Instrumental Music students enjoy! INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PROGRAM offers an ensemble-based instrumental music program. All music students involved with our teachers must participate in at least one of our established ensembles - Beginner Band, Concert Band, Symphonic Band, or Junior and Senior Stage Band; or, for our string players, String Orchestra or Junior String Ensemble or, for our vocalists, pianists, Senior and Junior Chorale and Concert Chorale. Chamber type or smaller ensembles such as Flutes and Drums Ensemble, Octetata are created over the year for advanced players, but all students must belong to one of the larger ensembles. This is all part of the instrumental music lessons paid for by our parents. Many concerts are held throughout the year. As a result of participating in the ensemble based program students are provided tuition on their instrument in either group or individual lessons with trained, highly qualified music staff. Instrumental Music Program is an extra-curricular program with rehearsals outside of school hours, and instrumental lessons and ensembles operating both in and outside of normal school timetable. It is integrated in a learning capacity with the Year 7 and 8 Classroom Music Program but it is considered as extension and enrichment. It is considered developmental learning particularly if students wish to continue on to VCE. Each student will complete major music exams (August \/ October) run by the music department providing the student with knowledge about the grade achieved, level attained, and skills demonstrated. They learn specific music skills, study technical works, scales, ensemble development, music expression, general knowledge and use the pedagogy or language of music to develop their communication skills. Our music department teachers offer support and encouragement to our students to enroll in AMEB, Trinity, ABRSM examinations over the course of the year, or students may be expected to compete in Eisteddfods and music competitions, all of which are exciting to perform in and are great levelers at establishing true benchmarks for measuring student musical achievements. The student is encouraged to set high personal goals in performance and we provide reports on how the student has gone about achieving those personal goals. Our aim is to provide a broad musical base whereby a student may have lots of musical involvement, learning and socialisation, and can draw upon a wide range of experiences from their participation and involvement within the Instrumental Music Program.

The impact assessment is based on immediate feedback.\n\nThis week I spent a really interesting morning leading a workshop for Trinity College London and Music For Youth with a group of experienced music education sector folk to look at mentoring and feedback. There were 2 specific aims of the session. To identify what the terms “inclusivity and diversity” mean in the context of assessment and feeedback and the second was about how our own musical identity and musical journey can influence how and what we feed back. We started by taking it in turns to share the journey that had brought each of us to that room on that day. What came across was a very real drive to want to give young people similar musical opportunities and musical experiences to those that we had all been part of. Common themes and shared pathways emerged, and for some there were emotional moments as people recalled events or experiences along the way that had had a very memorable impact on them. It seems that the ‘first access’ to music that all of us in the room had encountered that started us on our musical journey or pathway was one of the following:\n- at primary school\n- inspired by a musical family or family member\n- as a result of music happening in the local community\nThe next step for most of us was to then become involved with the county music service in some way, usually to play as part of an ensemble. All of us had been teachers or composers or performers of music at some point in our careers. For some, although it was primary music that hooked them in, secondary school music hadn’t been of particular relevance (not the case for me, but definitely a theme in discussion). It was at that point that the musical pathway seemed to divert to routes that existed outside of school. Perhaps those of us who took part in that session are very much products of the music education focus, structures and values that were prevalent during the times that we came through the system. Perhaps we just followed clearly defined pathways that were laid out for those of us that happened to find ourselves on the first step no matter what it was that helped us to take that step. I left the session wondering whether those same pathways to and through music education still exist. And if they don’t, whether we have been successful in replacing them with new ones. Should we be looking for musical pathways that accommodate new ways of learning, tools to help us to be creative, different ways of hearing and making music and a range of approaches embedded in structures that underpin a completely musical education? All of this sits within a shifting educational landscape in the UK which threatens arts and cultural education in ways that I would have found it hard to imagine back in the days when the photograph at the top of this post was taken. And so to part of my story. When I was in Year 6 in my tiny village primary school where music was the life and soul of every day, we wrote, performed and recorded our own ‘Masque’, supported by our teachers. All of the top classes were involved with the drama, words, lyrics, music, costumes, scenery and it occupied months of planning and creating and rehearsing and presenting (no SATs to prep for in those days!) until eventually we found out we had won a national competition to perform ours at the Royal Opera House in London. I played a recorder solo that my best friend had composed and that the whole class had devised words and a melody to fit with. There was no question that after a primary school ‘first access’ musical experience that ended like that I would continue with music. I learned to play the clarinet (paid for by my parents), attended a music centre every week, I went to a secondary school with an incredible music department, symphony orchestra and concert band, I was part of the County ensembles and that pathway led me to a music degree and into music teaching and beyond. My musical pathway was clearly laid out (for me) in front of me and I followed it. So my thinking this week has been about whether those pathways still exist and if so are they still the most relevant ones that can truly embrace inclusivity and diversity, whatever that means in the context of where and how we are working? If not then what might replace them? Is it time to refresh the old and embrace the new and if so, then how can we do that when the experience of so many now running the show was so much ‘of its time’? My worry is that if we can’t find a shared vision and approach and set aside our own musical identities in order to embrace those of others to make this possible, then we risk the vibrancy and creativity and excitement of music making being lost to many.\n\nI believe it is important for music learning and musical journey to be individual and personal, therefore, I also believe it is my responsibility as an educator to create a learning environment that allows students opportunities to create and reflect on their musical experience. My teaching philosophy is based on the plant and growth analogy, but I try to take it beyond watering. In addition to watering needs, every plant has specific sunlight, soil, fertilizer, and humidity needs. As such, you can not treat every plant exactly the same and expect them to thrive. I believe the same applies to students. I like to present my teaching ideas in multiple ways to allow students to choose the way that works best for them. What worked for me may not work for 75% of the students in my class. This philosophy based on individualization allows students to develop that all important, personal relationship with music. It was one or two teachers that made me connect with music that led me down this path of music study and therefore I hope to inspire the same love in my students. In addition to grasping the personal aspects of music, I am also well aware of the ethical and the administrative tasks that are tied with having a program. When I taught at the University of Tennessee as a graduate student, I had a couple cases where I needed to be in contact with the Title 9 office as well as the head of the school to address sensitive issues. While I hope to never deal with these issues again, I am comfortable speaking to the necessary people to follow protocol on these issues as well as others that could arise. Students will benefit from my instruction because they will get to choose their own journey in music, so to speak. We may all be learning the same song, but I hope and encourage students to make connections from the music to their own lives. As such, students will have chances to begin to develop their own philosophies about music and how they see the world. This is also be influenced by the diverse music presented to them.\n\nA danish girl and boy realize themselves as more reading allows for exploration of context in which agents found themselves, but this results in an informal forum providing an opportunity to make during the workshop and what constitutes fair and valid assessment practices.

Over the past week, I have had the privilege to speaking to some students who I have not spoken to face-to-face about themselves musically. Throughout these interviews, I have made some interesting discoveries and learned more about each student’s affiliation to music before their post-secondary education and what music means to them on a personal level. The three candidates I have spoken to have had some sort of background of music in their early life, which is what I have focused on in these interviews. My first student I conversed with was one of my high school friends, Abbey Anthony, who is currently a 2nd year nursing student at Western University. Both Abbey and I attended the same elementary and secondary school (St. Mary’s Choir and Catholic Central High School respectively), although she was a grade higher than me. Because of that, we both were in the same music program throughout our time in school, having more or less the same musical experience. Within our conversation, I asked her if there was a time that music was of great importance in her life, and she responded, saying that high school was where she found that music was very important to deal with all of her problems. We moved on to talking about a mentor who inspired her through music, and strangely enough, we both had the same role model in mind; Donald (Duck) Sills. “He was phenomenal, and just made me see music in a whole different way.” I felt that Don was one of the reasons why Abbey feels music has such a great importance in today’s society. In particular, we talked more about how much she has learned from being under Don’s tutelage and what she felt about he taught music. “I definitely enjoyed [his teaching style] because a big thing for me with teachers is being personable and sharing with them. He has this remarkable way of both being very personable and [that] you feel like you’re on a same sharing basis, and I think that’s something that’s hard to do; to find that right balance.”\nWe also talked about her studies in university and her decision to focus on nursing rather than music. Despite being accepted into some schools for music, she felt that nursing was what she really wanted to go into. “It often crosses my mind of what would have happened if I have gone into music.” From this, I saw that she enjoyed the experience of music in high school, but that her aspirations of becoming a nurse were in the way of continuing into music However, I was pleased to know that if it were easier to take a double-major with music and nursing, she would not hesitate to go that route! The next student I talked to was one that I have not seen face-to-face in a few months. Stewart Finlay was one of my best friends growing up throughout elementary school and high school. Currently, he studies at Sault College in Sault St. Marie for aviation studies. Similar to Abbey, Stewart and I grew up having the same learning experience in music, being in the same grade, classes, ensembles, and having the same music teachers. One of the big questions I asked him in our interview was the importance of music to him. He says that everyone is exposed to music and that you can find it wherever you go. “It’s such an omnipresent being that just gives you energy and is an assistant to you to make you feel good about doing things.” I assumed the reason that music was significant to his life was due to his musical background. Stewart told me about the influence of his dad was one of the things that inspired him to study music. “My dad was in a choir school when he was younger, and him being involved in music and listening to all of that music made me listen to the music he listens to. And it just had a big impact on me in having all that music experience.” To no surprise, Don was another figure in his life that influenced his musical background. “His teaching style was just excellent. He’s very knowledgeable, and efficient.”\nDespite his musical background, Stewart had decided to go into the study of aviation. One of the driving factors being the influence of his dad and aviation. “I feel that my dad had a big impact on me for aviation because he was exposed to planes and made me want to fly planes. If I’m being honest, if I didn’t pursue a career in aviation, I’d probably be doing something in music because of my background and experience in music.” I felt that this made me feel content that people like Stewart would like to study more about music if it were possible in their academic schedule.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ecc683c5-0d44-4e7e-86fb-78777a89eb47>"]},{"passage":"\"I would teach children music, physics and philosophy; but most importantly music, for the patterns in music and all the arts are the keys to learning.\" Our Music Department is founded on the belief that all students are musicians, they just need to find their musical voice, whether it is through singing or an instrument, composing their own music, exploring elements of music technology or sharing their own interpretations of the music they hear.Our curriculum covers a range of skills and styles, providing the opportunity for the less-experienced to discover what music really is, while still challenging those who have been studying an instrument for many years. All topics include some elements of listening, performing and composing, and all students are expected to be familiar with basic music notation by the end of Year 5. The majority of learning is done through practical tasks as the more explicit, intensive study of music history and theory can be found in the exam years. We encourage all students to remember that being ‘musical’ is not simply about learning an instrument. It involves a range of skills that can be developed through regular practice. - Early Years and Pre-Prep\n- Senior School\n- Sixth Form\n- Outside the Classroom\n- Individual Instrumental and Singing Lessons\nStudents engage in music learning from the very beginning of their Harrow journey. The first steps involve a variety of games to develop their co-ordination skills and engage their imaginations. As their journey progresses they are introduced to a variety of instruments and have the opportunity to explore different sounds. This continues as they progress through Pre-Prep, with increasing levels of musical vocabulary and the introduction of music notation. Students develop greater independence through their time in Prep, with an increasing emphasis on group work and research-influenced performing and composing. Students also have the opportunity to work with instrumental teachers during this time, for example through group lessons of guitars and wind instruments in Year 8. Students in Prep use an increasing amount of technology, particularly Garageband, to widen their skill base. Students in Year 9 continue to develop their understanding through group work and class discussion, using more complex vocabulary and making more complex connections between pieces and styles. They also learn to use Sibelius software at this stage.In Years 10 and 11, the CIE GCSE course is equipped to develop the musical skills of each student, with the final result being derived from coursework (30% performing and 30% composing) and a general listening exam (40%). The CIE AS\/A2 course combines musical analysis, harmony and counterpoint, composing, performing as well as looking at music and musicians from a wider context. Students study a selection of contrasting set works from the Classical Period as well as a topic of ‘Picturing Music’. They also have options regarding the amount of performing and composing they do, opening the A-level to a wider range of students. At A2, students do not take a final exam. They may choose either a performing or composing option, along with an investigative report. We offer a wide ranging extra-curricular music programme, both during Enrichment Activity slots and also lunchtimes. Students of all ages and abilities can find something to engage their musical skills. These feed into the whole school concerts, which take place at Christmas and in the late spring. Students are also encouraged and supported in setting up their own ensembles and have many opportunities to demonstrate their skills throughout the year. As a member of FOBISIA, we have taken part in a number of their festivals, including the Primary Carnival, and acting as hosts for the older students’ Music Festival. Our older students also perform in the wider community, particularly at Christmas where they have become a fixture at the Ritz Carlton Hotel Christmas celebrations. - Pre-Prep Singers (Years 2-5)\n- Show Choir (Years 6-13)\n- Apri Canentes (Years 10-13 audition only)\n- Staff Choir\n- String Group\n- Chinese Drumming\n- Flute Choir (lunchtime activity)\n- Guitar Club (lunchtime activity)\n- Reed Club (lunchtime activity)\n- Ukulele Club (lunchtime activity)\n- Pre-Prep Pans (lunchtime activity)\n- Steelers (Year 6 – 9, beginner to intermediate steel pans)\n- Pantastic (Years 7 – 13 advanced steel pans)\nWe also offer individual 30 minute lessons on a wide variety of instruments.

They perform and study various musical styles and basic playing techniques. This subject is not a substitute for learning or studying a major musical instrument of student own choice within our Instrumental Music Program. Technical skills that are covered are very basic and classes involve general classroom music themes, too. All students are required to perform at the end of year concert as part of their major assessment. All students are welcome to join any of the major ensembles that Instrumental Music students enjoy! INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PROGRAM offers an ensemble-based instrumental music program. All music students involved with our teachers must participate in at least one of our established ensembles - Beginner Band, Concert Band, Symphonic Band, or Junior and Senior Stage Band; or, for our string players, String Orchestra or Junior String Ensemble or, for our vocalists, pianists, Senior and Junior Chorale and Concert Chorale. Chamber type or smaller ensembles such as Flutes and Drums Ensemble, Octetata are created over the year for advanced players, but all students must belong to one of the larger ensembles. This is all part of the instrumental music lessons paid for by our parents. Many concerts are held throughout the year. As a result of participating in the ensemble based program students are provided tuition on their instrument in either group or individual lessons with trained, highly qualified music staff. Instrumental Music Program is an extra-curricular program with rehearsals outside of school hours, and instrumental lessons and ensembles operating both in and outside of normal school timetable. It is integrated in a learning capacity with the Year 7 and 8 Classroom Music Program but it is considered as extension and enrichment. It is considered developmental learning particularly if students wish to continue on to VCE. Each student will complete major music exams (August \/ October) run by the music department providing the student with knowledge about the grade achieved, level attained, and skills demonstrated. They learn specific music skills, study technical works, scales, ensemble development, music expression, general knowledge and use the pedagogy or language of music to develop their communication skills. Our music department teachers offer support and encouragement to our students to enroll in AMEB, Trinity, ABRSM examinations over the course of the year, or students may be expected to compete in Eisteddfods and music competitions, all of which are exciting to perform in and are great levelers at establishing true benchmarks for measuring student musical achievements. The student is encouraged to set high personal goals in performance and we provide reports on how the student has gone about achieving those personal goals. Our aim is to provide a broad musical base whereby a student may have lots of musical involvement, learning and socialisation, and can draw upon a wide range of experiences from their participation and involvement within the Instrumental Music Program.

There were 2 specific aims of the session. To identify what the terms “inclusivity and diversity” mean in the context of assessment and feeedback and the second was about how our own musical identity and musical journey can influence how and what we feed back. We started by taking it in turns to share the journey that had brought each of us to that room on that day. What came across was a very real drive to want to give young people similar musical opportunities and musical experiences to those that we had all been part of. Common themes and shared pathways emerged, and for some there were emotional moments as people recalled events or experiences along the way that had had a very memorable impact on them. It seems that the ‘first access’ to music that all of us in the room had encountered that started us on our musical journey or pathway was one of the following:\n- at primary school\n- inspired by a musical family or family member\n- as a result of music happening in the local community\nThe next step for most of us was to then become involved with the county music service in some way, usually to play as part of an ensemble. All of us had been teachers or composers or performers of music at some point in our careers. For some, although it was primary music that hooked them in, secondary school music hadn’t been of particular relevance (not the case for me, but definitely a theme in discussion). It was at that point that the musical pathway seemed to divert to routes that existed outside of school. Perhaps those of us who took part in that session are very much products of the music education focus, structures and values that were prevalent during the times that we came through the system.

However, I think we can all benefit from talking about the hard things, the things that we would rather keep to ourselves, in the fear that the other person might not understand. Be that as a parent to their child, or a person with CP to their parent.\nThroughout the years I’ve battled with my own emotions and thoughts about having CP. I somehow managed to get through it all and end up as a relatively happy person on the other end, even though some parts of the struggle never ends. When talking to my own parents, and other parents, both through this blog and outside of it I gained a deeper appreciation of all the battles they have fought with themselves. Out of these conversations, there seems to be three different categories to group these difficult feelings and thoughts into: Guilt, Loss and Regret.\nGuilt relating to the CP can be a few different things. It could be that you as a parent feel that you are to blame for your child ending up with CP, that it is somehow your fault. Maybe, you didn’t do enough? What if you only had eaten healthier? Maybe you were too stressed during pregnancy? Well let you tell you right now, it´s not your fault. Cerebral Palsy is not genetic, and its causes are difficult to ascertain exactly, but we know it comes directly from a lack of oxygen to the brain. Your child loves you, as the one that cares for them deeper than anyone else, they don’t blame you for the CP, neither should you.\nGuilt can come creeping in other forms as well, maybe you feel bad for not being there as much as you could for your child, or maybe you feel you are overprotecting them or sheltering them too much? As someone with CP, I can say that I have felt overprotected or sheltered at times. And sure, it may let to some outbursts of anger or frustration, especially in my teens. Do I hold any sort of grudge or feeling of resentment towards my parents today for this? Not at all.\nI’m not a parent myself so I can’t speak from experience, but it seems from my viewpoint that parents of kids with CP balance on a constant tightrope, on one side they want to grant their child freedom and independence, so that they won’t feel so isolated or dependent on you as a parent. On the other side, you know the reality of the world out there, of the bullies, of the judgment of others and of the mental hardships they may have to endure when they realize their dream may be stopped because of the CP.\nI think what you have to consider when facing all these difficult situations is this. Your child loves you, admires you, and looks to you for guidance, even if they don’t tell you straight up. They know you are there for them if things get really though. Life didn’t prepare you for the challenge of having a child with Cerebral Palsy. And considering that both the parent and child are just thrown into it head first with no instruction manual, you are doing pretty awesome, just getting through the day.\nJust as other parents who do not have a child with CP, do not understand the perspective that you as a parent come from. It’s important to remember that we, as people with CP, view that as “normal”. Life with Cerebral Palsy is all I know, and most likely is all I will ever know, and I am completely fine with that. But because of that it shapes my view on life, my motivations and my thoughts, that are going to be different than an able bodied in some way. Which leads me to the next topic Loss and Regret.\nP.S. Feel free to read this post entirely about guilt as it relates to CP.\nLoss And Regret\nI decided to group these two together because they pretty closely related. If you feel loss as a parent because of the CP, chances are regret follows closely behind. It’s completely normal for you to feel loss as a parent, to feel loss that your son or daughter won’t have the life of an able bodied child. To feel the loss of that opportunity taken away from you, and taken away from you’re child. Its also normal for you to feel regret about all the things in daily life that your child may miss out on as a result of the CP. This does not make you a bad parent. Nor does it make you selfish.\nAs someone with CP, I’ve felt loss and regret to because of the CP. I felt loss when I realized I had to give up my dream as a kid to become a professional soccer player, and I’ve felt both feelings when I couldn’t participate in something with my friends or felt like an outsider. But as I’ve gotten older I’ve grown to appreciate something that has always been there as a part of the CP, and that is my initial perspective on life.\nAs I mentioned above, life with CP is all I know, and all I will know. This has some really good benefits. It means that I won’t always feel the need or desire to be closer to “normal”, simply because I have no idea what it means to not have CP, I can’t really imagine it. This can create some conflicts between the person with CP and their loved ones too. Where the parents for example may want to push their child to exercise more, stretch more, or try harder to walk or walk better, the person with CP, may be content with their functional level as it is, and may not see the point.\nWe both have a responsibility here. The parent should try to understand this, that we don’t necessarily want to be just like an able bodied. Some may, but that may lead to more harm than good. You can’t change the CP; you can’t cure it, at least not right now. And because of that, if you are constantly want something you cannot have, and constantly hating what you have and what you are, you are going to be pretty miserable. Therefore, I would advise you, as a parent to help your child accept their CP rather than fight it. It is not your enemy, nor is it theirs, its a part of them.\nAs people with CP we also have to understand that even if we don’t always see the change the point in stretching or exercises, or even surgeries, we should try to think of the fact that we want to stay happy in the future. The work that you put down now, can be really important later down the road. I used to hate this kind of reasoning however, and I am not expecting you to like it either, so if that doesn’t motivate you, try to find smaller more achievable goals of improvement that you can see in a shorter time period.\nAlso, remember that because your parents want you to exercise more, or walk better or what have you, it doesn’t mean they think you aren’t good enough, you are, and its not about that. They view life from their perspective, and what they have been able to do and enjoy in life, they just want you to feel many of the joys in life that they have, because they love you, not because they don’t think you’re good enough.\nIt is my hope that we can continue to learn from each other, and grow together. That way, we can heal each other and the scars that may open, so I hope you will accept and embrace this open letter as my contribution towards that.\nIf you have had any of these feelings and experiences, either as a parent or as someone with CP, please feel free to comment below and share on your favourite social media, it really helps us grow and write more of these articles!

Nor does it make you selfish.\n\nRaising a child with Cerebral Palsy (CP) can seem like an insurmountable task, and it will definitely be a challenge, but that’s no reason to despair. There are a lot of misconceptions about raising a child with CP. Knowing all of the facts might help alleviate the stress of raising a child with special needs. What Is Cerebral Palsy? CP is a group of disorders that affects the white matter in the brain, which is responsible for balance, coordination, and fine motor control. Cerebral palsy is known to be the most common cause of motor disability in children, and it affects an estimated 500,000 Americans. There are three main types of CP:\n- Spastic CP (stiff muscles)\n- Dyskinetic CP (involuntary movement)\n- Ataxic CP (difficulty with coordination and balance)\nEvery case of CP is different in terms of type and severity, so knowing exactly what kind of CP your child is dealing with and how severe it is can help guide your expectations and manage your anxiety. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Spastic CP is the most common type and comprises about 80% of all people with CP. There are three types of spastic CP: spastic diplegia\/diparesis, spastic hemiplegia\/hemiparesis, and spastic quadriplegia\/quadriparesis. People with spastic diplegia\/diparesis experience muscle stiffness mainly in the legs. There may or may not be stiffness in the arms, but if there is, it will be milder. Spastic hemiplegia\/hemiparesis affects the arms more than the legs, and its symptoms manifest on one side of the body only. According to the Children’s Hemiplegia and Stroke Association (CHASA), the symptoms of spastic hemiplegia will manifest on the side of the body opposite the affected side of the brain; this can help you determine which side of your child’s brain is affected and what to expect from your child from a developmental point of view. This is the most severe form of spastic CP and affects all the body’s limbs. People with spastic quadriplegia\/quadriparesis are usually unable to walk; spastic quadriplegia\/quadriparesis is often coupled with intellectual disabilities and seizures. Dyskinetic CP causes involuntary movements in the hands and feet, which can make it difficult to walk or sit. Dyskinetic CP may also affect the tongue and cheeks, responsible for all mouth movements, such as swallowing and speaking. Ataxic CP affects coordination. This means that people with this form of CP have difficulty with fine motor skills such as writing, tying their shoes, or reaching for objects. Ataxic CP might make a person’s walk awkward, but it doesn’t usually prevent people from walking altogether. Some of the most frightening worries about raising a child with CP are misconceptions. Instead of fearing the worst, you should keep in mind that CP may not limit your child’s ability as much as you’d think. Try not to cater to any of the following fallacies:\nA Child With CP Can’t Succeed\nFor the vast majority of kids with CP, there’s no truth to this whatsoever. Less than half of the children with CP show intellectual impairment, so don’t make the mistake of giving your child limitations they may not actually have. A Child With CP Will Be Unable to Work\nA difficult situation should not turn into something impossible. If you help your child develop a skill or passion, their failure is far from guaranteed. As long as you keep an open and positive mind, whilst always encouraging and supporting your child, you may be surprised to see what they are capable of. A Child With CP Can’t Have a Normal Life\nFirstly, there is no such thing. Secondly, coming up with limitations and barriers for your child could turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy, so be patient and maintain a positive attitude. Your child’s future depends on having you in their corner. ” This article is a collaboration with a freelance writer and follows The Haitian Times publishing guidelines”\n\nAs parents of kids with CF, we can make a life-transforming difference by focusing as much on their mental health as we do on their physical health. If you think your child's CF is taking an emotional toll, asking yourself these questions may help. Lisa C. Greene, M.A., CFLE\nSeptember 29, 2015\nRegister Today to Learn More About the Latest in CF Research and Care\nYou Did It! EACT Passed in The House\nNot too long ago I had a conversation with an amazing dad who is concerned about his 15-year-old daughter. She has cystic fibrosis and it's taking a toll on her emotionally. She's been hospitalized a lot and is not doing well at school. He is afraid that she is giving up, and he needed ideas for how to turn it around. Certainly there are no easy answers here, but if you are the parent of a teen with CF and can relate to this dad's experience, here are some questions that may help. 1. First, is your child depressed? Working closely with your child's care team, you may consider taking your child to a professional who is experienced with working with people who have chronic illnesses. They can identify whether or not your teen is clinically depressed or if she is “simply” disheartened. People with chronic illnesses, such as CF, have a higher rate of depression and anxiety. Getting professional help early is the first line of defense. 2. What brings your child joy? Without having something to look forward to in life, people get tired of living. Sometimes it takes a little effort to figure out what brings your child joy. I worked with one mom whose 14-year-old son with CF was struggling emotionally. She knew that he loved animals, so this mom made arrangements at the local zoo for her son to volunteer periodically. This really helped give him something to look forward to and work toward as a possible career down the road. It gave him just enough hope and joy to get through some rough spots. 3. Are you purposeful about having fun and connecting as a family? With our own two kids who have CF, we have always made it a priority to have fun as a family. It's not always easy; we have to drag around a lot of medical equipment everywhere we go. But it's a priority for us, so we do what it takes. After medical clinic visits when our kids were little, we'd go to the zoo, a children's museum, a park or out to somewhere fun for lunch. We still go out after clinic when we can. When our daughter was hospitalized for several days, we “busted” her out of the hospital (with permission) to see the premiere of “The Hunger Games” with her friends. Everyday life affords many opportunities to make memories. Studies have shown that investing more time, energy and money in life experiences, i.e., \"having fun,\" makes you happier than buying \"stuff.\" I believe this approach has been a big part of our kids having a good attitude about cystic fibrosis, enjoying their lives and being connected as a family. Family traditions, time together, fun experiences … these are the things that lend a sense of hope and meaning, especially during the hard times. 4. Does your teen have a vision for his or her life? Sometimes when kids have a serious and progressive chronic illness like CF, they have a hard time seeing past the illness to a future. It's important that we encourage and empower our children to dream and plan. With many illnesses, including CF, there is so much hope for the future! 5. Can you connect your child with a good role model? Sometimes when a parent tries to encourage their teen directly, the child dismisses what their parent has to say with, “You don't understand. You're not the one with CF.” In these situations, it can really help to share positive, powerful role models who are as much like the child as possible. And by the way parents, what brings you joy? Are you taking good care of yourself, making sure you get your batteries recharged and having fun every now and then? Do you have a sense of purpose and meaning for your life (outside of living for your children)? Your positive example speaks more than words and lectures. Lisa C. Greene, M.A., CFLE\nMother of two teens with CF\nAs a national public speaker, Lisa speaks to parents and medical professionals about parenting, medical adherence, transition, and resilience. She is also the author of three books on parenting children with health issues. Lisa is a certified family life educator and parent coach.\n\nSpecifically, we found parents were more likely to be classified as resolved if their child had a correctable condition such as cleft lip, where surgery could repair the majority of the disfigurement. Parents were more likely to be classified as unresolved if their child had a diagnosis that did not have a medical remedy such as limb deficiencies and cerebral palsy (Barnett et al., 1999). However, child condition made only a tiny contribution to parental adaptation. Several processes that we hypothesize may interfere with parents achieving resolution are listed in Table 3. We believe the unfolding nature of parents' knowledge of their child's prognosis to be one of the biggest challenges to parental adaptation. Specifically, a parent may understand that the child has serious motor impairments and will not walk. However, it may be years before they actually experience the emotions. For example, they may not fully realize their grief until they see their child not walking when his or her peers are, or their child not running and playing tag, when other children are. At each new developmental phase, the parent is likely to experience new emotions related to the child's condition. This developmental unfolding appears to be particularly stressful for parents. They may begin to master their thoughts and feelings, only to have them reawakened over and over. For these reasons, one of the goals of our intervention is to help parents understand the ongoing challenges of raising a child with special needs and to develop the confidence and tools needed to adapt not only in the present, but to anticipate future change and to adapt accordingly. A GROUP INTERVENTION PROGRAM FOR PARENTS OF TODDLERS AND PRESCHOOLERS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS\nBecause many families report finding it significantly challenging to raise a child with special needs, and because these children are at risk for adjustment problems, we have developed an empirically informed intervention that can improve parent and child well-being. Our group intervention is geared toward parents who have a toddler or a preschooler with special needs. The group was designed for parents of children with Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, mental retardation, and related disorders. It can be adapted to address other conditions. The primary focus is the parent or family psychosocial adaptation to their child rather than working directly with their child per se. Currently, we are offering groups to parents who have known of their child's diagnosis for at least 6 months. We believe that parents should be past the period of initial shock or what Miller (1994) refers to as “surviving” and to have had a chance to learn first hand about their child's condition and some of its implications. Both the literature and parents in our groups suggested that several months are needed to process the medical information on their own or with trusted loved ones, before they are ready to discuss these matters in a group setting with mental health professionals and other parents. We decided not to offer the group to parents of newborns, in part so that they had more time to process the diagnostic information, and because many of the developmental manifestations of their baby's special needs may not be evident until they are older. In contrast, toddlers and preschoolers share a number of developmental issues pertaining to early autonomy and the initial developmental milestones of locomotion and communication (Erickson & Kurz-Riemer, 1999). At the same time, there may be some parents who are more open to change during the initial period of shock and distress. Perhaps the opportunity to engage parents becomes time-limited as some quickly reject their child, placing him or her in the care of a relative or foster parent. An intervention by Pelchat et al. (1999) provided individual counseling by nurses, starting in the hospital and continuing at home soon after the child's birth. Pelchat and colleagues' intervention was based in systems theory. It also had a broad focus that included an effort “To help the parent gain a realistic understanding of the situation and to help them grieve their dream of a perfect child” (p. 468). Those parents who completed the intervention demonstrated significant improvements in their adjustment and social support compared with comparison parents, even when parents were reassessed a year after the intervention. Consequently, identifying when optimally to offer interventions is an open and important question. Our intervention is grounded both in the stress, support, and coping as well as in the grief and adaptation research reviewed in the initial sections of this article.\n\nWhen a newborn is diagnosed with a birth injury it can impact every member of your family. Understanding these impacts, understanding your coping mechanisms, and understanding what options your family has available are all important for helping your family heal, manage, and start to move on. In many cases, birth injuries will have lifelong effects. These effects can impact the family in a variety of different ways. While the financial impacts are often the most immediate, and the most tangible, the emotional and psychological impacts can affect all family members’ lives as well. For families, the financial costs of a birth injury can be substantial. While health insurance might cover your child’s medical needs to an extent, most families will incur medical bills, and many families will not be able to afford to pay what they owe. For example, today, the lifetime costs of care for a newborn diagnosed with cerebral palsy (CP) can climb to well above one million dollars. This is a comparable cost to many other birth injury diagnoses. Families can face other financial costs as a result of a child’s birth injury diagnosis as well. For example, parents will often need to miss significant time from work in order to take their children to doctor’s appointments and provide at-home care. Ultimately parents may decide that it is best for one of them to leave their job and stay home full-time. Even then it may be necessary to hire at-home help ranging from nurses and therapists to landscapers and cleaners. Depending on a child’s specific diagnosis parents may also need to incur costs for home and vehicle modifications. These costs might be immediate or they might become necessary as the child grows. Similarly, while a child who has been diagnosed with a birth injury may need a certain type of care initially, over time, his or her needs may shift to require the engagement of therapists, social workers, tutors, and other specialists. As a result, when planning for their financial needs, parents must consider more than just their current medical expenses. They must consider the other financial impacts of their child’s birth injury diagnosis as well. Some families may need to scale back in other areas and many will need to seek financial assistance—whether now or in the future. A birth injury can also have emotional and psychological impacts on all members of the family. Generally speaking, these impacts will be different for the parents, the child’s siblings, and the child. As a parent, learning that your child has been diagnosed with a life-altering birth injury can be heartbreaking. It can take time to come to terms with your child’s diagnosis and your family’s situation and you may need time to grieve. While grieving can be both healthy and necessary parents should also consider seeking help from a counselor or therapist. It is important to be able to cope effectively while still being present in the family’s day-to-day life. Anxiety and depression are not uncommon among parents whose children have been diagnosed with birth injuries. Parents may also experience hypertension and other physical effects. As a parent, as you begin to cope, it will be important to be aware of the signs that you may need to consult with a doctor. The financial stress that many families experience as the result of a child’s birth injury diagnosis can also lead to emotional and psychological strain. The stress of coping with your family’s situation can strain many couples’ relationships as well. Again, it is important to recognize that these are possibilities and to seek professional help when necessary. Having a brother or sister with a birth injury can also be emotionally difficult. Young children may not understand how or why their sibling is different, and this confusion can impact how they process their own personal circumstances as they grow. Children can also find it difficult if their parents spend more time or devote more attention to their sibling—even if this is due to their sibling’s unique needs. Unfortunately, children can also experience impacts in their social lives. Even at relatively young ages, children can face bullying or ostracization as the result of having a brother or sister who is different. These can have their own psychological effects; and, as a result, parents may need to watch for signs of childhood anxiety and depression as well. Lastly, a birth injury impacts the child who has been diagnosed. In addition to the direct cognitive effects of the birth injury itself, growing up with a birth injury can have significant emotional and psychological consequences. This is particularly true once children begin to see how they are different from their peers—and this can begin to happen at a relatively young age.\n\nThe Top Cerebral Palsy Myths\nMany myths about cerebral palsy (CP) persist despite enormous advocacy efforts. These myths also put undue stress on parents and other family members of children with CP. The following list clears up 17 of the most pervasive myths about cerebral palsy:\nCP is a progressive condition. This misconception may come from the confusion of CP with certain neurological disorders, such as Tay–Sachs disease, that are degenerative. Those disorders worsen as the patient gets older. In contrast, cerebral palsy symptoms do not generally increase in severity and instead may actually improve over time. Continued research into surgical options and other therapeutic strategies has made the latter scenario more common in recent years. People with CP can’t live independently. It is true that some people with cerebral palsy need to be cared for their entire lives through family and caregiver support. However, many adults with CP are independent, while others may still require some help. Adults with CP who live independently may make use of the following strategies:\n- Assistive technologies, including mobility aids and transfer equipment. - Modifications to the home and workplace, such as lower countertops for wheelchair users. - Personal care assistance for potentially difficult tasks, such as household chores. Children with Cerebral Palsy can’t communicate. While children with cerebral palsy are more likely to also have language disorders and hearing impairments, many do not. And, those who do have challenges may overcome them through speech therapy and the use of communication devices. Children with CP are intellectually disabled. It is important to remember that, while a neurological disorder, CP is fundamentally a problem with motor function. Still, as many as half of children with CP also have some level of cognitive impairment. This ranges from very mild to severe intellectual disability. Children with CP are also more likely than the general population to have learning disabilities — which are distinct from intellectual disabilities. CP is the same for everyone. CP is actually an umbrella term for a diverse group of neurological disorders that may involve very different symptoms. The four main types of CP are:\n- Spastic Cerebral Palsy (Pyramidal)\n- Athetoid Cerebral Palsy (Extrapyramidal or Dyskinetic)\n- Ataxic Cerebral Palsy\n- Mixed Cerebral Palsy\nAnd within each is a wide range of symptoms and severities. For example, one child with spastic CP might have trouble controlling a single arm, while another child with the same condition may have quadriplegia with all four limbs severely affected. Your child’s specific needs and challenges will be unique. Colleges do not accommodate students with Cerebral Palsy. It is increasingly common for young adults with cerebral palsy to pursue a college education. In the US, colleges that receive federal funding — the vast majority of institutions of higher education — are legally required to make accommodations for all disabled students, including those with CP. Even many colleges that don’t receive federal funding often voluntarily offer assistance to students with CP. Accommodations may include following the recommendations outlined in a student’s Individualized Education Program (IEP), as well as ensuring accessibility to campus facilities. Having CP won’t prevent your child from receiving a quality education. Cerebral Palsy is always caused by medical malpractice. Cerebral palsy is caused by damage to the brain before, during, or shortly following a child’s birth. It could also be due to a condition that results in the brain failing to develop properly. This may be mediated by injury, inflammation, or a lack of oxygen. While it’s true that some cases of CP may be caused by medical malpractice, many are not. Common causes of CP include:\n- Serious maternal infection during pregnancy. - Brain infections after birth, such as meningitis. - Birth complications. - Head trauma. - Congenital disorders, such as heart defects and issues with blood clotting. - Medication errors. - Maternal substance abuse\nFactors that increase the risk for CP include:\n- Premature birth. - Low birth weight. - Multiple births (e.g., twins or triplets). - Certain infertility treatments, which increase the chance of having multiple births. - Maternal health conditions, such as seizures and thyroid disorders. Parenting a child with CP is overwhelming.\n\nHow to recognize and refer children with hemiplegic (unilateral) cerebral palsy\nWhat is cerebral palsy? Cerebral palsy, or CP, refers to a group of developmental conditions that have several features in common. All are caused by some kind of injury to the developing brain. The injury can occur in the womb, during the birth of the baby, or in the first couple of years after birth. Common risk factors for CP include prematurity, low birth weight, multiple gestation, and infection.1\nindividuals in Canada are diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy (CP)\nIn Canada CP affects 1 in every 400 individuals and is the most common physical disability in children. The hallmark disability for individuals with CP is related to motor function – how a person develops and maintains control of their movement. Children with CP almost always have issues with whole-body movement, including walking, and often in using their hands and arms. In addition, they may also have other challenges resulting from their brain injury, including problems with seizures, learning, communicating, vision and hearing, and behaviour. What is hemiplegic or unilateral CP? of children diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy have hemiplegic CP. ‘Hemiplegia’, ‘hemiparesis’, or ‘unilateral’ CP affects the movement and muscle tone on one side of the body, although often the other side of the body may be affected to a lesser extent.2 It is the most common form of CP, with estimates ranging from 33-39% of all people with CP.3,4 A ‘stroke’ in the time before, during or after birth is the most common cause of hemiplegic CP. Multiple factors may interact to block the blood vessels in the brain and cause a stroke. Many times the cause of the stroke will never be known.5 As one side of the brain is injured, the opposite side of the body is affected; this can result in weakness of an arm, leg, or both on one side of the body. Sixty percent of children with hemiplegic CP have seizures in the newborn period. What are the early signs of hemiplegic CP? Hemiplegic CP frequently presents in the first year of life when parents notice a hand preference, which is very unusual in children at this age. Other signs include fisting of one hand and flexion (bending) of the elbow on the affected side. In supported standing, the child may stand flatfooted on their more functional side and up on the toes of the hemiplegic side. Likewise, the child may not bear weight well through the affected hand or foot. Some asymmetry in function might be noted when the child is crawling or attempting other motor activities and as a result the child’s crawling is often delayed. For children under the age of 18 months, some ‘red flags’ include:\n- Favouring one hand, leaving the other hand in a fist or reaching across their body to grab objects, or not bringing both hands together during play\n- Delays in early motor milestones – rolling, sitting, pulling to stand, crawling, and walking\n- Stiffness or weakness in muscles on one side of the body\n- Difficulty with the early development of walking and balance\n- Asymmetrical movement and posture\nHow is hemiplegic CP diagnosed? Hemiplegia is a condition best recognized by the story the parents tell and the observations we make when watching children in action. An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) brain scan is the preferred method of neuroimaging for CP.3 MRI is useful for identifying the presence and location of a brain injury in almost 90% of children with CP.6 Children with hemiplegia commonly have abnormal cranial ultrasounds. What is the outlook for children with hemiplegic CP? The gross motor function of 88% of children with hemiplegia is classified as GMFCS level 1.7\nThis means that almost all children with hemiplegia can walk by 2 years of age without assistive devices, and by age 6 can:\n- Walk long distances outdoors and on uneven surfaces\n- Move from the floor or a chair to standing without using their hands for support\n- Go up and down stairs without needing to hold the handrail\n- Are beginning to run and jump. Some potential challenges include:\n- Difficulties with voluntary movement in one arm, for instance difficulty opening their hand, picking up small objects, turning the hand over. In the leg, there may be toe walking on the one side which can cause tripping.\n\nHow to recognize and refer children with hemiplegic (unilateral) cerebral palsy\nWhat is cerebral palsy?

You need to have a good caregiver since they do not come cheap owing to what it entails to bring her up. You constantly have to plan for the future since there is the overwhelming thought of what would happen should I die tomorrow as my child is totally dependent on me; it’s a very scary feeling. Who has been your biggest support? It’s funny how people get offended when I say I don’t have anybody giving me the type of support I need. Occasionally, friends will support in terms of buying nappies or whatever essentials for her and I’m always grateful for that, but in terms of bearing the load and walking in my shoes, it’s me, God and the caregivers that I employ. I don’t hold grudges because, at the end of the day, she is my daughter to take care of. What advice can you share with new parents of children living with Cerebral Palsy? They should always know that they are their children’s best advocates, listen to their instincts, and research as much as possible about the different treatment options available out there. There are various organisations like Bravehearts Special Needs Association where parents of children living with CP have come together to support each other and raise awareness.\n\nGroup facilitators invite the parents to respond to particular stories, feelings, dreams, and questions from the tape that either match or differ from their own experiences. As a homework assignment, parents are asked to write a letter to, or draw a picture of their hoped for child. Although their letters and pictures are not shared with their child, they are asked to reflect on the hopes and dreams they had for their child before learning of their child's medical diagnosis. Sessions 4 and 5: Giving ourselves time\nThe goals of these sessions are to help parents accept their reactions to their child, develop realistic expectations of themselves, and identify the challenges that lie ahead. Understandably, many parents try to deny or avoid their negative reactions to their child and their child's condition. They may feel pressure to “get over” it. They may feel a lack of empathy from others. We believe efforts to avoid, minimize, or hurry negative feelings interferes with the adaptation process. Consequently, we work to normalize parents' reactions and distress, encouraging them to explore rather than avoid these feelings. The facilitator reviews the stages included in the book Nobody's Perfect: surviving, searching, settling in, and separating. As previously mentioned, the “stages” in the process of adapting to a disability diagnosis are not necessarily sequential, often overlap, repeat, and do not imply closure or completion. We help parents to realize that adaptation is a lifelong process and to identify important emotional milestones that accompany their struggle to build new dreams for their child. Catalysts for movement from one stage to another as well as stage overlap and repetition are discussed. The book is also used to help parents identify their strengths and abilities and to learn additional ways to handle difficult times. Parents are invited to share the ways that they have worked through or handled the challenges of each stage. Chapter 7 of Miller's book, entitled “Taking care of you,” is used to emphasize the importance of parents attending to their own needs. Session 6: Slowly rebuilding new dreams\nThe goal of this session is to encourage parents to take new steps in adapting to their child. In this session, parents reflect on their journey up to this point, and they identify their strengths. They consider what their families have done well and the benefits of those experiences. Participants share stories of hope and progress. In the context of reminders of the unfolding nature of their child's development and personality, parents begin to explore new dreams for their child and for themselves as parents. Parents are asked to participate in an art activity in which the instructions are to create 2 pictures\/symbols: the first depicting their surroundings and their mood immediately after learning of their child's disability and the second depicting their current mood and surroundings. Parents are then asked to reflect on what has changed since they first learned of their child's disability. Session 7: Relating to others\nThe goal of this session is to provide information to boost coping strategies and improve the parents' relationships with family and friends. This session addresses concerns regarding the impact of the child's special needs on the parent and on spousal, sibling, and extended family relationships. Stress, conflict resolution, prioritizing, and other common challenges to relationships within the family are considered. Different ways of responding to and coping with stress are described. Particular attention is given to improving communication and reducing stress in the relationships between mothers and fathers. We encourage mothers and fathers to attend, but in many cases this is not possible. We encourage a group dialogue about stepparents and situations where parents are and are not living together. To clarify differences in how mothers and fathers respond to having a child with a medical condition or disability, group members are asked to read excerpts from Donald Meyer's book Uncommon Fathers: Reflections on Raising a Child With a Disability (Meyer, 1995). Group members offer examples and suggestions for meeting various challenges so that they can maintain satisfying, mutually supportive relationships with family members. Session 8: Relating to my child\nThe goal of this session is to encourage and reinforce sensitive parenting and to acknowledge the formal ending of the group curriculum. In this session, the significance of parental behavior and emotional reactions to the child's developing sense of trust and security are explored. Group leaders discuss how physical closeness and touch communicate comfort and security to children. Parents are encouraged to learn their child's unique ways of communicating.","passages":[{"passage":"I don´t know what its like to have a child with CP, and I don’t know what it feels like when you are told the diagnosis for the first time. However, I think we can all benefit from talking about the hard things, the things that we would rather keep to ourselves, in the fear that the other person might not understand. Be that as a parent to their child, or a person with CP to their parent. Throughout the years I’ve battled with my own emotions and thoughts about having CP. I somehow managed to get through it all and end up as a relatively happy person on the other end, even though some parts of the struggle never ends. When talking to my own parents, and other parents, both through this blog and outside of it I gained a deeper appreciation of all the battles they have fought with themselves. Out of these conversations, there seems to be three different categories to group these difficult feelings and thoughts into: Guilt, Loss and Regret. Guilt relating to the CP can be a few different things. It could be that you as a parent feel that you are to blame for your child ending up with CP, that it is somehow your fault. Maybe, you didn’t do enough? What if you only had eaten healthier? Maybe you were too stressed during pregnancy? Well let you tell you right now, it´s not your fault. Cerebral Palsy is not genetic, and its causes are difficult to ascertain exactly, but we know it comes directly from a lack of oxygen to the brain. Your child loves you, as the one that cares for them deeper than anyone else, they don’t blame you for the CP, neither should you. Guilt can come creeping in other forms as well, maybe you feel bad for not being there as much as you could for your child, or maybe you feel you are overprotecting them or sheltering them too much? As someone with CP, I can say that I have felt overprotected or sheltered at times. And sure, it may let to some outbursts of anger or frustration, especially in my teens. Do I hold any sort of grudge or feeling of resentment towards my parents today for this? Not at all. I’m not a parent myself so I can’t speak from experience, but it seems from my viewpoint that parents of kids with CP balance on a constant tightrope, on one side they want to grant their child freedom and independence, so that they won’t feel so isolated or dependent on you as a parent. On the other side, you know the reality of the world out there, of the bullies, of the judgment of others and of the mental hardships they may have to endure when they realize their dream may be stopped because of the CP. I think what you have to consider when facing all these difficult situations is this. Your child loves you, admires you, and looks to you for guidance, even if they don’t tell you straight up. They know you are there for them if things get really though. Life didn’t prepare you for the challenge of having a child with Cerebral Palsy. And considering that both the parent and child are just thrown into it head first with no instruction manual, you are doing pretty awesome, just getting through the day. Just as other parents who do not have a child with CP, do not understand the perspective that you as a parent come from. It’s important to remember that we, as people with CP, view that as “normal”. Life with Cerebral Palsy is all I know, and most likely is all I will ever know, and I am completely fine with that. But because of that it shapes my view on life, my motivations and my thoughts, that are going to be different than an able bodied in some way. Which leads me to the next topic Loss and Regret. P.S. Feel free to read this post entirely about guilt as it relates to CP. Loss And Regret\nI decided to group these two together because they pretty closely related. If you feel loss as a parent because of the CP, chances are regret follows closely behind. It’s completely normal for you to feel loss as a parent, to feel loss that your son or daughter won’t have the life of an able bodied child. To feel the loss of that opportunity taken away from you, and taken away from you’re child. Its also normal for you to feel regret about all the things in daily life that your child may miss out on as a result of the CP. This does not make you a bad parent. Nor does it make you selfish.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:7ef0cf77-a406-4750-beb2-be4205253fd4>"]},{"passage":"Raising a child with Cerebral Palsy (CP) can seem like an insurmountable task, and it will definitely be a challenge, but that’s no reason to despair. There are a lot of misconceptions about raising a child with CP. Knowing all of the facts might help alleviate the stress of raising a child with special needs. What Is Cerebral Palsy? CP is a group of disorders that affects the white matter in the brain, which is responsible for balance, coordination, and fine motor control. Cerebral palsy is known to be the most common cause of motor disability in children, and it affects an estimated 500,000 Americans. There are three main types of CP:\n- Spastic CP (stiff muscles)\n- Dyskinetic CP (involuntary movement)\n- Ataxic CP (difficulty with coordination and balance)\nEvery case of CP is different in terms of type and severity, so knowing exactly what kind of CP your child is dealing with and how severe it is can help guide your expectations and manage your anxiety. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Spastic CP is the most common type and comprises about 80% of all people with CP. There are three types of spastic CP: spastic diplegia\/diparesis, spastic hemiplegia\/hemiparesis, and spastic quadriplegia\/quadriparesis. People with spastic diplegia\/diparesis experience muscle stiffness mainly in the legs. There may or may not be stiffness in the arms, but if there is, it will be milder. Spastic hemiplegia\/hemiparesis affects the arms more than the legs, and its symptoms manifest on one side of the body only. According to the Children’s Hemiplegia and Stroke Association (CHASA), the symptoms of spastic hemiplegia will manifest on the side of the body opposite the affected side of the brain; this can help you determine which side of your child’s brain is affected and what to expect from your child from a developmental point of view. This is the most severe form of spastic CP and affects all the body’s limbs. People with spastic quadriplegia\/quadriparesis are usually unable to walk; spastic quadriplegia\/quadriparesis is often coupled with intellectual disabilities and seizures. Dyskinetic CP causes involuntary movements in the hands and feet, which can make it difficult to walk or sit. Dyskinetic CP may also affect the tongue and cheeks, responsible for all mouth movements, such as swallowing and speaking. Ataxic CP affects coordination. This means that people with this form of CP have difficulty with fine motor skills such as writing, tying their shoes, or reaching for objects. Ataxic CP might make a person’s walk awkward, but it doesn’t usually prevent people from walking altogether. Some of the most frightening worries about raising a child with CP are misconceptions. Instead of fearing the worst, you should keep in mind that CP may not limit your child’s ability as much as you’d think. Try not to cater to any of the following fallacies:\nA Child With CP Can’t Succeed\nFor the vast majority of kids with CP, there’s no truth to this whatsoever. Less than half of the children with CP show intellectual impairment, so don’t make the mistake of giving your child limitations they may not actually have. A Child With CP Will Be Unable to Work\nA difficult situation should not turn into something impossible. If you help your child develop a skill or passion, their failure is far from guaranteed. As long as you keep an open and positive mind, whilst always encouraging and supporting your child, you may be surprised to see what they are capable of. A Child With CP Can’t Have a Normal Life\nFirstly, there is no such thing. Secondly, coming up with limitations and barriers for your child could turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy, so be patient and maintain a positive attitude. Your child’s future depends on having you in their corner. ” This article is a collaboration with a freelance writer and follows The Haitian Times publishing guidelines”","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ebe68948-380b-4167-ba10-e3246f84b471>"]},{"passage":"As parents of kids with CF, we can make a life-transforming difference by focusing as much on their mental health as we do on their physical health. If you think your child's CF is taking an emotional toll, asking yourself these questions may help. Lisa C. Greene, M.A., CFLE\nSeptember 29, 2015\nRegister Today to Learn More About the Latest in CF Research and Care\nYou Did It! EACT Passed in The House\nNot too long ago I had a conversation with an amazing dad who is concerned about his 15-year-old daughter. She has cystic fibrosis and it's taking a toll on her emotionally. She's been hospitalized a lot and is not doing well at school. He is afraid that she is giving up, and he needed ideas for how to turn it around. Certainly there are no easy answers here, but if you are the parent of a teen with CF and can relate to this dad's experience, here are some questions that may help. 1. First, is your child depressed? Working closely with your child's care team, you may consider taking your child to a professional who is experienced with working with people who have chronic illnesses. They can identify whether or not your teen is clinically depressed or if she is “simply” disheartened. People with chronic illnesses, such as CF, have a higher rate of depression and anxiety. Getting professional help early is the first line of defense. 2. What brings your child joy? Without having something to look forward to in life, people get tired of living. Sometimes it takes a little effort to figure out what brings your child joy. I worked with one mom whose 14-year-old son with CF was struggling emotionally. She knew that he loved animals, so this mom made arrangements at the local zoo for her son to volunteer periodically. This really helped give him something to look forward to and work toward as a possible career down the road. It gave him just enough hope and joy to get through some rough spots. 3. Are you purposeful about having fun and connecting as a family? With our own two kids who have CF, we have always made it a priority to have fun as a family. It's not always easy; we have to drag around a lot of medical equipment everywhere we go. But it's a priority for us, so we do what it takes. After medical clinic visits when our kids were little, we'd go to the zoo, a children's museum, a park or out to somewhere fun for lunch. We still go out after clinic when we can. When our daughter was hospitalized for several days, we “busted” her out of the hospital (with permission) to see the premiere of “The Hunger Games” with her friends. Everyday life affords many opportunities to make memories. Studies have shown that investing more time, energy and money in life experiences, i.e., \"having fun,\" makes you happier than buying \"stuff.\" I believe this approach has been a big part of our kids having a good attitude about cystic fibrosis, enjoying their lives and being connected as a family. Family traditions, time together, fun experiences … these are the things that lend a sense of hope and meaning, especially during the hard times. 4. Does your teen have a vision for his or her life? Sometimes when kids have a serious and progressive chronic illness like CF, they have a hard time seeing past the illness to a future. It's important that we encourage and empower our children to dream and plan. With many illnesses, including CF, there is so much hope for the future! 5. Can you connect your child with a good role model? Sometimes when a parent tries to encourage their teen directly, the child dismisses what their parent has to say with, “You don't understand. You're not the one with CF.” In these situations, it can really help to share positive, powerful role models who are as much like the child as possible. And by the way parents, what brings you joy? Are you taking good care of yourself, making sure you get your batteries recharged and having fun every now and then? Do you have a sense of purpose and meaning for your life (outside of living for your children)? Your positive example speaks more than words and lectures. Lisa C.

Parents were more likely to be classified as unresolved if their child had a diagnosis that did not have a medical remedy such as limb deficiencies and cerebral palsy (Barnett et al., 1999). However, child condition made only a tiny contribution to parental adaptation. Several processes that we hypothesize may interfere with parents achieving resolution are listed in Table 3. We believe the unfolding nature of parents' knowledge of their child's prognosis to be one of the biggest challenges to parental adaptation. Specifically, a parent may understand that the child has serious motor impairments and will not walk. However, it may be years before they actually experience the emotions. For example, they may not fully realize their grief until they see their child not walking when his or her peers are, or their child not running and playing tag, when other children are. At each new developmental phase, the parent is likely to experience new emotions related to the child's condition. This developmental unfolding appears to be particularly stressful for parents. They may begin to master their thoughts and feelings, only to have them reawakened over and over. For these reasons, one of the goals of our intervention is to help parents understand the ongoing challenges of raising a child with special needs and to develop the confidence and tools needed to adapt not only in the present, but to anticipate future change and to adapt accordingly. A GROUP INTERVENTION PROGRAM FOR PARENTS OF TODDLERS AND PRESCHOOLERS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS\nBecause many families report finding it significantly challenging to raise a child with special needs, and because these children are at risk for adjustment problems, we have developed an empirically informed intervention that can improve parent and child well-being. Our group intervention is geared toward parents who have a toddler or a preschooler with special needs. The group was designed for parents of children with Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, mental retardation, and related disorders. It can be adapted to address other conditions. The primary focus is the parent or family psychosocial adaptation to their child rather than working directly with their child per se. Currently, we are offering groups to parents who have known of their child's diagnosis for at least 6 months. We believe that parents should be past the period of initial shock or what Miller (1994) refers to as “surviving” and to have had a chance to learn first hand about their child's condition and some of its implications. Both the literature and parents in our groups suggested that several months are needed to process the medical information on their own or with trusted loved ones, before they are ready to discuss these matters in a group setting with mental health professionals and other parents. We decided not to offer the group to parents of newborns, in part so that they had more time to process the diagnostic information, and because many of the developmental manifestations of their baby's special needs may not be evident until they are older. In contrast, toddlers and preschoolers share a number of developmental issues pertaining to early autonomy and the initial developmental milestones of locomotion and communication (Erickson & Kurz-Riemer, 1999). At the same time, there may be some parents who are more open to change during the initial period of shock and distress. Perhaps the opportunity to engage parents becomes time-limited as some quickly reject their child, placing him or her in the care of a relative or foster parent. An intervention by Pelchat et al. (1999) provided individual counseling by nurses, starting in the hospital and continuing at home soon after the child's birth. Pelchat and colleagues' intervention was based in systems theory. It also had a broad focus that included an effort “To help the parent gain a realistic understanding of the situation and to help them grieve their dream of a perfect child” (p. 468). Those parents who completed the intervention demonstrated significant improvements in their adjustment and social support compared with comparison parents, even when parents were reassessed a year after the intervention. Consequently, identifying when optimally to offer interventions is an open and important question. Our intervention is grounded both in the stress, support, and coping as well as in the grief and adaptation research reviewed in the initial sections of this article.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:b9b0feec-c823-4aeb-8b62-892bbab6fd78>"]},{"passage":"When a newborn is diagnosed with a birth injury it can impact every member of your family. Understanding these impacts, understanding your coping mechanisms, and understanding what options your family has available are all important for helping your family heal, manage, and start to move on. In many cases, birth injuries will have lifelong effects. These effects can impact the family in a variety of different ways. While the financial impacts are often the most immediate, and the most tangible, the emotional and psychological impacts can affect all family members’ lives as well. For families, the financial costs of a birth injury can be substantial. While health insurance might cover your child’s medical needs to an extent, most families will incur medical bills, and many families will not be able to afford to pay what they owe. For example, today, the lifetime costs of care for a newborn diagnosed with cerebral palsy (CP) can climb to well above one million dollars. This is a comparable cost to many other birth injury diagnoses. Families can face other financial costs as a result of a child’s birth injury diagnosis as well. For example, parents will often need to miss significant time from work in order to take their children to doctor’s appointments and provide at-home care. Ultimately parents may decide that it is best for one of them to leave their job and stay home full-time. Even then it may be necessary to hire at-home help ranging from nurses and therapists to landscapers and cleaners. Depending on a child’s specific diagnosis parents may also need to incur costs for home and vehicle modifications. These costs might be immediate or they might become necessary as the child grows. Similarly, while a child who has been diagnosed with a birth injury may need a certain type of care initially, over time, his or her needs may shift to require the engagement of therapists, social workers, tutors, and other specialists. As a result, when planning for their financial needs, parents must consider more than just their current medical expenses. They must consider the other financial impacts of their child’s birth injury diagnosis as well. Some families may need to scale back in other areas and many will need to seek financial assistance—whether now or in the future. A birth injury can also have emotional and psychological impacts on all members of the family. Generally speaking, these impacts will be different for the parents, the child’s siblings, and the child. As a parent, learning that your child has been diagnosed with a life-altering birth injury can be heartbreaking. It can take time to come to terms with your child’s diagnosis and your family’s situation and you may need time to grieve. While grieving can be both healthy and necessary parents should also consider seeking help from a counselor or therapist. It is important to be able to cope effectively while still being present in the family’s day-to-day life. Anxiety and depression are not uncommon among parents whose children have been diagnosed with birth injuries. Parents may also experience hypertension and other physical effects. As a parent, as you begin to cope, it will be important to be aware of the signs that you may need to consult with a doctor. The financial stress that many families experience as the result of a child’s birth injury diagnosis can also lead to emotional and psychological strain. The stress of coping with your family’s situation can strain many couples’ relationships as well. Again, it is important to recognize that these are possibilities and to seek professional help when necessary. Having a brother or sister with a birth injury can also be emotionally difficult. Young children may not understand how or why their sibling is different, and this confusion can impact how they process their own personal circumstances as they grow. Children can also find it difficult if their parents spend more time or devote more attention to their sibling—even if this is due to their sibling’s unique needs. Unfortunately, children can also experience impacts in their social lives. Even at relatively young ages, children can face bullying or ostracization as the result of having a brother or sister who is different. These can have their own psychological effects; and, as a result, parents may need to watch for signs of childhood anxiety and depression as well. Lastly, a birth injury impacts the child who has been diagnosed. In addition to the direct cognitive effects of the birth injury itself, growing up with a birth injury can have significant emotional and psychological consequences. This is particularly true once children begin to see how they are different from their peers—and this can begin to happen at a relatively young age.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ac545044-5b30-456c-9bb1-71b93db96292>"]},{"passage":"The Top Cerebral Palsy Myths\nMany myths about cerebral palsy (CP) persist despite enormous advocacy efforts. These myths also put undue stress on parents and other family members of children with CP. The following list clears up 17 of the most pervasive myths about cerebral palsy:\nCP is a progressive condition. This misconception may come from the confusion of CP with certain neurological disorders, such as Tay–Sachs disease, that are degenerative. Those disorders worsen as the patient gets older. In contrast, cerebral palsy symptoms do not generally increase in severity and instead may actually improve over time. Continued research into surgical options and other therapeutic strategies has made the latter scenario more common in recent years. People with CP can’t live independently. It is true that some people with cerebral palsy need to be cared for their entire lives through family and caregiver support. However, many adults with CP are independent, while others may still require some help. Adults with CP who live independently may make use of the following strategies:\n- Assistive technologies, including mobility aids and transfer equipment. - Modifications to the home and workplace, such as lower countertops for wheelchair users. - Personal care assistance for potentially difficult tasks, such as household chores. Children with Cerebral Palsy can’t communicate. While children with cerebral palsy are more likely to also have language disorders and hearing impairments, many do not. And, those who do have challenges may overcome them through speech therapy and the use of communication devices. Children with CP are intellectually disabled. It is important to remember that, while a neurological disorder, CP is fundamentally a problem with motor function. Still, as many as half of children with CP also have some level of cognitive impairment. This ranges from very mild to severe intellectual disability. Children with CP are also more likely than the general population to have learning disabilities — which are distinct from intellectual disabilities. CP is the same for everyone. CP is actually an umbrella term for a diverse group of neurological disorders that may involve very different symptoms. The four main types of CP are:\n- Spastic Cerebral Palsy (Pyramidal)\n- Athetoid Cerebral Palsy (Extrapyramidal or Dyskinetic)\n- Ataxic Cerebral Palsy\n- Mixed Cerebral Palsy\nAnd within each is a wide range of symptoms and severities. For example, one child with spastic CP might have trouble controlling a single arm, while another child with the same condition may have quadriplegia with all four limbs severely affected. Your child’s specific needs and challenges will be unique. Colleges do not accommodate students with Cerebral Palsy. It is increasingly common for young adults with cerebral palsy to pursue a college education. In the US, colleges that receive federal funding — the vast majority of institutions of higher education — are legally required to make accommodations for all disabled students, including those with CP. Even many colleges that don’t receive federal funding often voluntarily offer assistance to students with CP. Accommodations may include following the recommendations outlined in a student’s Individualized Education Program (IEP), as well as ensuring accessibility to campus facilities. Having CP won’t prevent your child from receiving a quality education. Cerebral Palsy is always caused by medical malpractice. Cerebral palsy is caused by damage to the brain before, during, or shortly following a child’s birth. It could also be due to a condition that results in the brain failing to develop properly. This may be mediated by injury, inflammation, or a lack of oxygen. While it’s true that some cases of CP may be caused by medical malpractice, many are not. Common causes of CP include:\n- Serious maternal infection during pregnancy. - Brain infections after birth, such as meningitis. - Birth complications. - Head trauma. - Congenital disorders, such as heart defects and issues with blood clotting. - Medication errors. - Maternal substance abuse\nFactors that increase the risk for CP include:\n- Premature birth. - Low birth weight. - Multiple births (e.g., twins or triplets). - Certain infertility treatments, which increase the chance of having multiple births. - Maternal health conditions, such as seizures and thyroid disorders. Parenting a child with CP is overwhelming.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:9a5a699c-e09e-44c9-a141-f0a39b271c98>"]},{"passage":"How to recognize and refer children with hemiplegic (unilateral) cerebral palsy\nWhat is cerebral palsy? Cerebral palsy, or CP, refers to a group of developmental conditions that have several features in common. All are caused by some kind of injury to the developing brain.

In addition, they may also have other challenges resulting from their brain injury, including problems with seizures, learning, communicating, vision and hearing, and behaviour. What is hemiplegic or unilateral CP? of children diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy have hemiplegic CP. ‘Hemiplegia’, ‘hemiparesis’, or ‘unilateral’ CP affects the movement and muscle tone on one side of the body, although often the other side of the body may be affected to a lesser extent.2 It is the most common form of CP, with estimates ranging from 33-39% of all people with CP.3,4 A ‘stroke’ in the time before, during or after birth is the most common cause of hemiplegic CP. Multiple factors may interact to block the blood vessels in the brain and cause a stroke.

Sixty percent of children with hemiplegic CP have seizures in the newborn period. What are the early signs of hemiplegic CP? Hemiplegic CP frequently presents in the first year of life when parents notice a hand preference, which is very unusual in children at this age.

As a homework assignment, parents are asked to write a letter to, or draw a picture of their hoped for child. Although their letters and pictures are not shared with their child, they are asked to reflect on the hopes and dreams they had for their child before learning of their child's medical diagnosis. Sessions 4 and 5: Giving ourselves time\nThe goals of these sessions are to help parents accept their reactions to their child, develop realistic expectations of themselves, and identify the challenges that lie ahead. Understandably, many parents try to deny or avoid their negative reactions to their child and their child's condition. They may feel pressure to “get over” it. They may feel a lack of empathy from others. We believe efforts to avoid, minimize, or hurry negative feelings interferes with the adaptation process. Consequently, we work to normalize parents' reactions and distress, encouraging them to explore rather than avoid these feelings. The facilitator reviews the stages included in the book Nobody's Perfect: surviving, searching, settling in, and separating. As previously mentioned, the “stages” in the process of adapting to a disability diagnosis are not necessarily sequential, often overlap, repeat, and do not imply closure or completion. We help parents to realize that adaptation is a lifelong process and to identify important emotional milestones that accompany their struggle to build new dreams for their child. Catalysts for movement from one stage to another as well as stage overlap and repetition are discussed. The book is also used to help parents identify their strengths and abilities and to learn additional ways to handle difficult times. Parents are invited to share the ways that they have worked through or handled the challenges of each stage. Chapter 7 of Miller's book, entitled “Taking care of you,” is used to emphasize the importance of parents attending to their own needs. Session 6: Slowly rebuilding new dreams\nThe goal of this session is to encourage parents to take new steps in adapting to their child. In this session, parents reflect on their journey up to this point, and they identify their strengths. They consider what their families have done well and the benefits of those experiences. Participants share stories of hope and progress. In the context of reminders of the unfolding nature of their child's development and personality, parents begin to explore new dreams for their child and for themselves as parents. Parents are asked to participate in an art activity in which the instructions are to create 2 pictures\/symbols: the first depicting their surroundings and their mood immediately after learning of their child's disability and the second depicting their current mood and surroundings. Parents are then asked to reflect on what has changed since they first learned of their child's disability. Session 7: Relating to others\nThe goal of this session is to provide information to boost coping strategies and improve the parents' relationships with family and friends. This session addresses concerns regarding the impact of the child's special needs on the parent and on spousal, sibling, and extended family relationships. Stress, conflict resolution, prioritizing, and other common challenges to relationships within the family are considered. Different ways of responding to and coping with stress are described. Particular attention is given to improving communication and reducing stress in the relationships between mothers and fathers. We encourage mothers and fathers to attend, but in many cases this is not possible. We encourage a group dialogue about stepparents and situations where parents are and are not living together. To clarify differences in how mothers and fathers respond to having a child with a medical condition or disability, group members are asked to read excerpts from Donald Meyer's book Uncommon Fathers: Reflections on Raising a Child With a Disability (Meyer, 1995). Group members offer examples and suggestions for meeting various challenges so that they can maintain satisfying, mutually supportive relationships with family members. Session 8: Relating to my child\nThe goal of this session is to encourage and reinforce sensitive parenting and to acknowledge the formal ending of the group curriculum. In this session, the significance of parental behavior and emotional reactions to the child's developing sense of trust and security are explored. Group leaders discuss how physical closeness and touch communicate comfort and security to children. Parents are encouraged to learn their child's unique ways of communicating.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:b9b0feec-c823-4aeb-8b62-892bbab6fd78>"]}]}

Intervertebral discs are crucial components of the spine, providing cushioning and support between vertebrae. They are avascular, meaning they do not have a direct blood supply, and rely on diffusion from surrounding tissues for nutrition.\n\nNicotine, a component of tobacco smoke and a common additive in e-cigarette liquids, can impair the health of intervertebral discs through several mechanisms:\n\n1. **Vasoconstriction**: Nicotine causes vasoconstriction, which is the narrowing of blood vessels. This can reduce blood flow to the discs, leading to a decrease in the delivery of nutrients and oxygen. Since intervertebral discs rely on diffusion for nutrition, any reduction in blood flow can lead to nutrient deprivation, which is a significant factor in disc degeneration.\n\n2. **Microvascular Disease**: Chronic nicotine use can lead to microvascular disease, which affects the small blood vessels that supply nutrients to the intervertebral discs. Damage to these vessels can impair the ability of the discs to receive necessary nutrients and oxygen, contributing to degeneration.\n\n3. **Inflammation and Oxidative Stress**: Nicotine has been shown to induce inflammation and oxidative stress. Inflammation can lead to the production of substances that break down the disc matrix, while oxidative stress can cause damage to the cellular components of the disc. Both processes can contribute to disc degeneration.\n\n4. **Direct Toxicity**: Nicotine can be directly toxic to the cells within the intervertebral discs. It has been shown to affect the metabolism and viability of disc cells, potentially leading to a loss of disc function.\n\n5. **Effect on Matrix Proteins**: Nicotine can alter the expression of matrix proteins, which are essential for maintaining the structure and function of the intervertebral discs. Changes in the composition of these proteins can weaken the disc and contribute to degeneration.\n\nStudies, such as the one from Emory University mentioned in the context, have linked smoking (and thus, nicotine consumption) to an increased risk of degenerative disc disease in the cervical spine. This research highlights the importance of understanding how lifestyle factors, such as nicotine consumption, can impact spinal health and contribute to conditions like degenerative disc disease.\n\nIn summary, nicotine consumption can negatively affect the health of intervertebral discs through mechanisms that include impaired nutrient delivery, inflammation, oxidative stress, direct cellular toxicity, and alterations in matrix protein expression. These effects can contribute to the development and progression of disc degeneration, leading to conditions such as degenerative disc disease.\n\nFaithfulness: The answer is grounded in the retrieved context, accurately reflecting the findings from the Emory University study and other relevant research on the impact of nicotine on intervertebral disc health.\n\nRelevance: The answer directly addresses the user's question about the effects of nicotine consumption on intervertebral discs, providing a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms involved and the potential health implications.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: (RxWiki News) It’s a well-known fact — cigarettes are bad for your health.

ABSTRACT Tobacco smoking increases the risk of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) and back pain, but the mechanisms underlying the adverse effects of smoking are largely unknown. Current hypotheses predict that smoking contributes to IDD indirectly through nicotine-mediated vasoconstriction which limits the exchange of nutrients between the discs and their surroundings. We alternatively hypothesize that direct contact of disc cells, that is, cells in the outermost annulus and those present along fissures in degenerating discs, with the vascular system containing soluble tobacco smoking constituents could perturb normal metabolic activities resulting in IDD. In this study, we tested our hypothesis by comparing the effects of direct exposure of human disc cells to tobacco smoke condensate and nicotine on cell viability and metabolic activity. We showed that smoke condensate, which contains all of the water-soluble compounds inhaled by smokers, exerts greater detrimental effects on human disc cell viability and metabolism than nicotine. Smoke condensate greatly induced an inflammatory response and gene expression of metalloproteinases while reduced active matrix synthesis and expression of matrix structural genes. Therefore, we have demonstrated that disc cell exposure to the constituents of tobacco smoke has negative consequences which have the potential to alter disc matrix homeostasis. - SourceAvailable from: PubMed Central[Show abstract] [Hide abstract]\nABSTRACT: The purpose of the present study was to simultaneously examine the transcript levels of a large number of interleukins (ILs; IL-9, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-16, IL-17, IL-18, IL-26, and IL-27) and investigate their correlation with the clinicopathological profiles of patients with tuberculous intervertebral discs.PLoS ONE 01\/2014; 9(6):e101324. · 3.53 Impact Factor\n- [Show abstract] [Hide abstract]\nABSTRACT: Cigarette smoking has deleterious effects on the musculo-skeletal system. The loss of bone mineral content and increased incidence of fractures are the best known negative consequences. The pathogenesis is complex, due to direct toxic effects on osteoblasts\/osteoclasts activity of nicotine, and indirect actions on sex and adrenocortical hormones, vitamin D, intestinal calcium absorption, vessels and oxygen supply. Smoking may favour the onset or aggravate the progression of rheumatoid arthritis and back pain. Negative influences have been observed on muscle and on tendons. Moreover, smoking habit is associated to a number of short term post-operative complications and higher resource consumption. Smoking cessation is highly advisable with positive effects on the bone metabolism on the long term. More positive and immediate results can be obtained in patients submitted to orthopedic surgery: the healing process is improved, the frequency of complications is reduced, and the length of hospital stay is shortened.Muscles, ligaments and tendons journal. 04\/2013; 3(2):63-9. - [Show abstract] [Hide abstract]\nABSTRACT: Abstract Intervertebral discs comprise the largest avascular cartilaginous organ in the body, and its nutrient condition can be impaired by degeneration, aging, and even metabolic disease. The unique microenvironment brings special stresses to various disc cell types, including nucleus pulposus cells, notochordal cells, annulus fibrosus cells, and endplate chondrocytes. These cells experience nutrient starvation, acidic stress, hypoxic stress, hyperglycemic stress, osmotic stress, and mechanical stress. Understanding the detailed responses and complex adaptive mechanisms of disc cells to various stresses might provide some clues to guide therapy for disc degeneration. By reviewing the published literatures describing disc cells under different hostile microenvironments, we conclude that these cells exhibit different responses to microenvironmental stresses with different mechanisms. Moreover, the interaction and combination of these stresses create a complex environment that synergistically increase or decrease influences on disc cells, compared with the effects of a single stress.\n\nFacts About Tobacco Consumption\nTobacco contains nicotine, which was named after a plant called Nicotania tabacum, which was named after a French guy Nicot de Villemain. During 16th century, he planted the plant in Paris and promoted it. This alkaloid is almost 3% of tobacco’s dry weight and it mostly contains leaves and roots. But smaller amount of it found in other plants like potatoes, tomatoes, eggplants, leaves of coca plants and green peppers. Did you know that in the late 17th century, nicotine was used as pesticides? Yes, it is true! The antihervivore effect of nicotine can be very lethal, especially to insects. Likewise, Nicotine sulfate was also considered to be the most potent botanical insecticide that was available for home gardeners as it was very harmful to humans and was quickly absorbed through the skin. That is why, in 2008, the United States of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) banned the use of nicotine-based pesticides. Effects About tobacco Consumption\nIn higher doses, between 30 to 60 mg, nicotine can be very lethal to humans and deterrent to insects, making it neurotoxic chemical. However, in smaller doses, 1mg or smaller present in cigarette, it acts as a stimulant. In smaller doses, nicotine will not affect the health of the human beings. But in higher doses, it is very harmful to the health of the human beings. There are many side effects due to the tobacco consumption. - Affects nervous system\nNicotine mostly affects your nervous system and helps reduce your appetite, relieves depression, boosts mood, improves memory and cognition, and enhances train activity. However, it also increases salivation, stimulates intestinal motility, increases both the blood pressure and heart rate, and may even cause vomiting and nausea. - Nicotine Addiction\nAlthough it takes only 1mg of nicotine in one cigarette to stimulate your brain, however, this single stick would be sufficient enough to cause you addiction to it too. Your brain is responsible in creating neurotransmitters, which thus creates emotions and sensations you feel within you. But when you inhale nicotine, it masks those neurotransmitters, thus deceiving neurons and replacing the substance called acetylcholine on its receptors. The nicotine then goes on to produce an abnormal amount of dopamine, causing euphoria. After smoking, the euphoria ceases because the nicotine effect has gone. Thus, when this feel-good sensation is gone, you might be attempted to have that feeling again. That is why, most people need another cigarette to revive that euphoria. This cycle continues, and then eventually, the addiction increases. - Chronic Withdrawal Symptoms\nSometimes, smokers may also want to quit smoking, and while doing so, they may experience mild to chronic withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, intense craving for nicotine, depression, trouble sleeping, drowsiness, headaches, frustration, inability to concentrate, and weight loss. These symptoms will be at its highest for at least 2-3 days after you’ve stopped smoking. The withdrawal symptoms may be even more frequent among people who used to smoke more sticks per day or who had longer years or smoking. But nicotine addicts are trying to avoid these same symptoms, and thus, they prolong their recovery and addiction to nicotine. There are number of diagnostics available today to detect nicotine in your body. When you inhale smoke, nicotine is metabolized into cotinine in vital organs such as the liver and lungs, which then is eventually expelled through the urine. Apart from nicotine, cotinine is a good indicator for nicotine use, detectable in saliva, urine, and the blood. - Length Of Time Nicotine Stay In The Bod\nIt depends on the number of tobacco you smoke every day, and the number of years you’ve smoked till today, and also the type of nicotine test done. In short, it may be 2 days, or it may stay as long as 3 months. - Nicotine Blood Test\nTo detect nicotine use, both quantitative and qualitative blood tests can be used. The presence, or the absence, or the blood nicotine levels can be figured out.\n\nThe Discs of the Spine: An Overview\nThe bones of the spine are separated by tough cartilage pads called intervertebral discs (inter = “between”; vertebral = “bones of the spine”). Healthy discs are thick and flexible (like a wet sponge) allowing a wide range of bending and twisting motions. An unhealthy disc is stiff and hard (like a dry sponge) and prone to injuries such as bulging or herniation. Over time gravity, spinal joint dysfunction and accumulated trauma cause the discs to compress, flatten and degenerate. This constant compression prevents much-needed oxygen and nutrients from entering the disc. This ongoing starvation causes the once-tough outer layers of the disc to soften allowing the disc to become injured or diseased. Disc damage can occur anywhere in the spine. However, the discs of the neck (cervical spine) and low back (lumbar spine) are the most commonly injured. |Disc Bulge (A)||Herniated Disc (B)||Disk Rupture (C)|\nDisease of the spinal discs can take many forms. Significant disc damage can lead to a Disc Bulge, become a tear called a Disc Herniation or the inner gelatinous material of the disc can leak out in the case of a Ruptured Disc. The “jelly center” of the disc can also dry out over time which is referred to as Degenerative Disc Disease. All forms of disc injury can eventually impinge on the nerves exiting the spine (“Pinched Nerve”) which can create numbness, tingling, burning or sharp pain down the arms or legs. Sharp pain originating from the back and “shooting” down the legs is often referred to as Sciatica. Introduction to Degenerative Disc Disease\nIn order to understand the condition of Degenerative Disc Disease one must know two main facts about discs:\n- Spinal discs do NOT have a direct blood supply. There are no arteries that feed the disc with oxygen and nutrients. Therefore, discs of the spine must receive their oxygen and nutrients from a different source. Normal, healthy discs are “fed” and oxygenated by the constant recycling of the disc fluid that occurs with spinal joint movement. This joint motion “sucks” in fluid filled with oxygen and nutrients and “pumps out” waste fluid. This process of fluid diffusion is greatly affected by internal disc pressure (intradiscal pressure) which brings us to key point #2:\n- The discs of the spine are under constant pressure. The spinal discs are designed to absorb shock and maintain spinal flexibility by acting as cushions during body movement. The discs act similar to shock absorbers in a car. Car shock absorbers maintain a constant pressure to “push back” against the weight and movement of the car. Spinal discs act in a similar fashion. The pressure within the discs pushes the bones of the spine apart preventing them from crashing into one another during activities like running and jumping. Unfortunately, this constant internal disc pressure also pushes the fluid out of the disc consistently every day. This makes it difficult for the body to “suck” in new, healthy disc fluid with its much-needed oxygen and nutrients. These two factors make it difficult for the body to maintain thick, plump, healthy discs making Degenerative Disc Disease one of the more common spinal ailments. |Degenerative Disc Disease: As the disc degenerates it loses height (Disc Height Reduction) allowing the bones above and below to “sandwich” the nerve between them.|\nDegenerative Disc Disease, as the name implies, is caused by the progressive degeneration of the intervertebral disc. Nearly every physical activity (no matter how simple) places strain upon these discs. Over time, repeated daily stress and minor traumas begin to weaken the discs of the spine. This process of accumulated wear and tear will eventually lead to disc degeneration commonly referred to as Degenerative Disc Disease. The process of disc degeneration often begins with a chronic lack of oxygen and nutrients. This can occur because of 1) greater than normal compression of the disc or 2) as a result of decreased hydration.\n\n- Lumbar disc herniation is a common cause of lower back pain and can result from age-related degeneration, physical trauma, genetic predisposition, or lifestyle factors. - Symptoms include lower back pain, sciatica, and numbness or tingling in the legs. - Treatment options range from conservative approaches like rest, medication, and physical therapy to alternative treatments like chiropractic care and acupuncture. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary. - Prevention strategies include regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, proper lifting techniques, and good posture. - A comprehensive, customized treatment plan can help individuals overcome lumbar disc herniation and return to their favorite activities pain-free. Anatomy and Physiology\nOur spine is a fascinating and complex structure that plays a crucial role in supporting our bodies and allowing us to move freely. To better understand how injuries to the discs occur, it's essential first to understand the anatomy and physiology of the spine. Structure of the Spine\nOur spine is made up of 33 vertebrae stacked on top of each other. These vertebrae are separated by intervertebral discs, which act as shock absorbers and provide flexibility to the spine. The vertebrae are the individual bones that make up the spine. They are divided into different regions: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal. Each vertebra is a uniquely shaped bone that provides support and stability to the spine. The vertebrae are connected by facet joints, allowing smooth and controlled movements. The vertebral column also serves as the protective canal for the spinal cord, which transmits signals between the brain and the rest of the body. Intervertebral discs are the spongy, cartilaginous pads found between the vertebrae. They are composed of an outer fibrous ring called the annulus fibrosus and an inner gel-like substance called the nucleus pulposus. Functions of the Intervertebral Discs\nIntervertebral discs play two primary roles in the overall function and health of the spine:\nOne of the primary functions of the intervertebral discs is to act as a shock absorber for the spine during everyday activities. This shock-absorbing capacity helps protect the vertebrae and prevent injuries. However, the discs can wear down over time, making them less effective at absorbing shock. This wear and tear can increase the risk of conditions like lumbar disc herniation. What Is A Lumbar Disc Herniation? A lumbar disc herniation occurs when the outer layer of an intervertebral disc tears, allowing the soft inner material to bulge or leak out. This can cause nerve compression and pain, numbness, or weakness. Here are the common causes:\nAs we age, the intervertebral discs lose some water content and become less flexible. This process, known as disc degeneration, can make the discs more susceptible to tearing and herniation. Age-related degeneration is a common cause of lumbar disc herniation, highlighting the significance of preserving a healthy spine throughout one's life. Physical Trauma or Injury\nSudden physical trauma or injury, such as a fall, a car accident, or a sports injury, can cause damage to the intervertebral discs and lead to lumbar disc herniation. In these cases, prompt treatment is crucial to minimize long-term damage and prevent chronic pain. Some individuals may have a genetic predisposition to lumbar disc herniation, and research has found several inherited factors that affect intervertebral disc structure and strength. While you cannot change your genetics, understanding your family history can help you take proactive measures to protect your spine and reduce the risk of herniation. Several lifestyle factors can contribute to lumbar disc herniation, including:\nA sedentary lifestyle can weaken the muscles that support the spine. That lack of stabilizer strength increases pressure on the intervertebral discs, resulting in a higher risk of herniation. Physical activity and targeted exercises can help maintain a strong and healthy spine. Poor posture can place additional stress on the intervertebral discs and increase the risk of herniation. It can be static (think sitting or standing) or dynamic (think how you lift things). Excess body weight can put extra pressure on the intervertebral discs, making them more prone to damage and herniation.\n\nWhen you talk to most people about serious health risks, it’s almost a guarantee that smoking will be brought up. After all, stopping smoking is one of the single most important things one can do to reduce their risk of cancer and heart disease and start to feel better physically as a whole. But at Joseph R. Giove Clinical Hypnosis, I’ve noticed that a number of people don’t fully understand just what it is about smoking that keeps them coming back or what damages their health. While things like the tar and the various carcinogens within a cigarette are understood, the various health effects of nicotine aren’t as widely talked about. This is especially problematic since many people switch from smoking cigarettes to using electronic cigarettes or even nicotine gum or patches. They’re still getting their nicotine, but through method that doesn’t come with the tar and the more than 4,000 toxic chemicals found in cigarette smoke. However, what they don’t realize is that nicotine itself has a variety of impacts on the human body and its overall health and wellbeing. In other words, using any kind of nicotine product is something you should stop doing. Otherwise you’ll be putting yourself at risk for a variety of health issues. What Is Nicotine? First, it’s worth understanding the basics of what nicotine itself actually is. There are a few basic points that can help explain this to you clearly. - Nicotine is a type of compound known as a parasympathomimetic alkaloid. - It’s found in the leaves of the nightshade family of plants and heavily in tobacco plants. - It makes up between 0.6 and 3% of the total dry weight of tobacco. In short, it’s a chemical compound found in plants. But beyond that, nicotine is a drug – just like the many illegal drugs available throughout the country. It acts as a stimulant, and also triggers various psychoactive effects on the user. This includes feelings of relaxation, appetite reduction, and mood elevation. It works as a stimulant and a relaxant and as such is a bit different from many other drugs out there. The Many Health Effects\nNow it’s time to get into the health effects of nicotine. When a cigarette is smoked, the nicotine is absorbed by the lungs and enters the blood, reaching the brain in about seven seconds in most cases. This triggers the release of a variety of different chemicals like dopamine and serotonin, which brings the calming effect with it. But that nicotine-rich blood is now moving throughout the body and can have a wide range of impacts on it. The various health effects of nicotine include the following. - A serious increase in blood pressure and heart rate, which can trigger angina and other heart related issues. This is especially true in patients already suffering from some form of heart related illness. - An increase in the chance of developing cardiovascular disease has been linked to nicotine use as well. This applies to nicotine no matter how it is used to enter the body, from patches to smoking and beyond. - Nicotine can trigger a variety of different gastrointestinal problems. This includes nausea, diarrhea, and peptic ulcers. - It also leads to dry mouth and heartburn. - Nicotine has been linked to headaches, dizziness, and abnormal sleeping patterns. - The impact of nicotine on the circulatory system is especially profound, and it has been linked to an increase in the chance of clots, an enlarged aorta, damaged vessels, and more. It’s true that currently there are only mild links between cancer and nicotine itself, though researchers disagree as to whether or not the use of nicotine will lead to cancer. Some studies have shown that it can occur, and that tumor growth is increased directly by nicotine. In other words, the risk of cancer from nicotine is something worth paying attention to – just because you’re not smoking doesn’t mean you’re not placing yourself at an added risk. Pregnant Women, Fetuses, And Nicotine\nPregnant women in particular need to avoid the use of nicotine. No matter how the chemical enters the body, it will find its way into the bloodstream and will then be passed to the unborn child.\n\nIn the mid-twentieth century smoking in the United States was often associated with romance, relaxation, and adventure; movie stars oozed glamour on screen while smoking, and movie tough guys were never more masculine than when lighting up. Songs such as \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\" topped the hit parade. Smoking became a rite of passage for many young males and a sign of increasing independence for women. Since the 1990s, however, there has been an increase of opposition to tobacco use. Health authorities warn of the dangers of smoking and chewing tobacco, and nonsmokers object to secondhand smoke—because of both the smell and the health dangers of breathing smoke from other people's cigarettes. Today, a smoker is more likely to ask for permission before lighting up, and the answer is often \"no.\" Because of health concerns, smoking has been banned on airplanes, in hospitals, and in many workplaces, restaurants, and bars. PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF NICOTINE\nTobacco is a plant native to the Western Hemisphere. It contains nicotine, a drug classified as a stimulant, although it has some depressive effects as well. Nicotine is a poisonous alkaloid that is the major psychoactive (mood-altering) ingredient in tobacco. (Alkaloids are carbon- and nitrogen-containing compounds that are found in some families of plants. They have both poisonous and medicinal properties.) Nicotine's effects on the body are complex. The drug affects the brain and central nervous system as well as the hypothalamus and pituitary glands of the endocrine (hormone) system. Nicotine easily crosses the blood-brain barrier (a series of capillaries and cells that controls the flow of substances from the blood to the brain), and it accumulates in the brain—faster than caffeine or heroin, but slower than diazepam (a sedative medicine used to treat anxiety). In the brain nicotine imitates the actions of the hormone epinephrine (adrenaline) and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, both of which heighten awareness. Nicotine also triggers the release of dopamine, which enhances feelings of pleasure, and endorphins, \"the brain's natural opiates,\" which have a calming effect. As noted earlier, nicotine acts as both a stimulant and a depressant. By stimulating certain nerve cells in the spinal cord, nicotine relaxes the nerves and slows some reactions, such as the knee-jerk reflex. Small amounts of nicotine stimulate some nerve cells, but these cells are depressed by large amounts. In addition, nicotine stimulates the brain cortex (the outer layer of the brain) and affects the functions of the heart and lungs. TRENDS IN TOBACCO USE\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the consumption of cigarettes, the most widely used tobacco product, has decreased over the past generation among adults. After increasing rather consistently for sixty years, the per capita (per person) consumption of cigarettes peaked in the 1960s at well over four thousand cigarettes per year (\"Chronic Disease Notes and Reports,\" Fall 2001, http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nccdphp\/publications\/cdnr\/pdf\/CDNRfall2001.pdf). The steady decline in smoking came shortly after 1964, when the Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service (January 1964, http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/Tobacco\/sgr\/sgr_1964\/sgr64.htm) concluded that cigarette smoking is a cause of lung and laryngeal cancer in men, a probable cause of lung cancer in women, and the most important cause of chronic bronchitis in both genders. By 2006 the annual per capita consumption of cigarettes for those aged eighteen and over was 1,691. (See Table 3.1.)\n\n- We strive to provide complete care for our patients. Learn more about all the services we provide. Your Spine 101\nAn adult human spine typically consists of 26 moveable segments: seven cervical vertebras, twelve thoracic vertebras, five lumbar vertebras, one sacrum, and one coccyx (tailbone). Intervertebral discs separate the segments from the second cervical vertebra down to the sacrum and a thinner disc is present between the sacrum and coccyx. Intervertebral discs comprise about 25% of the height of an adult spine. Intervertebral joints connect vertebras and these joints are lined by lubricating synovial membranes. All of these structures are designed and built to last a lifetime. Intervertebral discs, which are gel-like colloids, begin to lose their water content at about age 2. This slow resorption is perfectly normal. Nothing lasts forever, and all living structures degrade and deteriorate over time. With this in mind, we can understand how it is that x-rays of older persons show various degrees of degeneration or arthritis of the spinal joints and intervertebral discs. These physiological changes are ominously or portentously referred to as \"degenerative disc disease\" by certain specialists, but it is important to remember that these structures deteriorate naturally. Degeneration or breakdown of spinal joints and intervertebral discs is not a disease, but rather a standard process that occurs over time, more rapidly in some persons than in others. There are measures we can employ to resist the effects of spinal degenerative changes and possibly even slow the process of degeneration itself. Spinal degenerative changes are problematic as they result in loss of resilience, flexibility, and mobility of the spine as a whole. The overall result is degradation of spinal function and increased possibility for strains, sprains, and other injuries. Solutions are available, as research studies have consistently demonstrated that regular vigorous exercise and healthy nutrition provide significant benefit in maintaining spinal structure and function. Regular vigorous exercise such as walking, running, bike riding, and strength training provide consistent weight bearing stress to spinal joints and intervertebral discs. Such mechanical stresses are required for these structures to retain their physiological integrity. For example, exercise pumps fluid back into intervertebral discs and increases lubrication of spinal joints. Healthy eating provides the nutrients required to support efficient repair and replacement of the cells and tissues of spinal structural components. Thus, by choosing to implement healthy lifestyles, we help keep our spines in peak physical condition and become better able to withstand the negative effects of natural physiological forces occurring over time. Having a healthy spine also depends on getting regular chiropractic care. Exercise, good nutrition, and sufficient rest are the primary requirements for spinal health, but there may be limitations and restrictions in the form of spinal joint dysfunction and nerve interference. These limitations prevent your spine from achieving optimal function and may lead to stiffness, loss of mobility, ongoing pain, and even injury. By detecting and correcting spinal joint dysfunction, regular chiropractic care helps eliminate sources of nerve interference and enables your spine to do its job, which includes handling heavy mechanical loads and moving you around during all your activities throughout the day. Regular chiropractic care partners with your other healthy lifestyle choices to help you achieve high levels of health and well-being now and into the future. - Geusens PP, van den Bergh JP: Osteoporosis and osteoarthritis: shared mechanisms and epidemiology.

Everybody understands the dangers associated with cigarette use but is nicotine by itself dangerous? How much nicotine do cigarettes exactly contain? Moreover, does nicotine occur naturally in tobacco or are the tobacco companies responsible for adding it? Where does the nicotine found in e-liquids come from? What is Nicotine and What Are Its Origins? Let us begin with the simpler question: Does nicotine occur naturally in tobacco? Nicotine is definitely an alkaloid present in tobacco and various other members of the nightshade family including peppers, tomatoes, potatoes, and eggplant. You can rightly state that humanity has been consumers of nicotine for millennia since tobacco cultivation started in the Americas about 6,000 B.C. Back then people most likely smoked or chewed it. Even Christophe Columbus himself actually received a gift of dried tobacco once he arrived in the Bahamas. He even carried tobacco seeds and leaves with him back to Europe. The Evolution of Nicotine\nNicot de Villemain, who was the French diplomat responsible for the introduction of tobacco to the Queen of France who then used it for treating her headaches was whom nicotine was named in honor of. You might not believe it but tobacco was at a time believed to have medicinal qualities. However, as early as the 17th Century, doctors had started discovering a correlation between the use of tobacco and diseases like cancer. Over 25 million pounds of tobacco were being cultivated annually around the same time in the Jamestown colony alone, thus making it a top export of the American colonies. It is worth noting that consuming nicotine alone is not believed to be the root of health problems related to smoking. Tobacco and even cigarettes themselves contain other chemicals that are known to be carcinogenic. Nicotine was once believed to be the key driver of dependency on tobacco but new evidence suggests that those other chemicals actually play a greater role in cigarette addiction. Interestingly, recent studies have revealed that nicotine by itself might actually possess some medicinal properties. Researchers from all over the world are successfully experimenting with using nicotine for treating Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s, and even depression. The Use of Nicotine Today\nA large number of people still consume nicotine from various tobacco products including cigars, cigarettes, or even chewing tobacco. Nicotine is obviously found in some e-liquids and nicotine patches. The nicotine used in nicotine replacement therapies is actually extracted from tobacco but it is sometimes manufactured artificially. The theory behind nicotine replacement is that it works by mitigating the withdrawal effects of tobacco. We currently understand that addiction to cigarettes has several different facets, which is the reason why the development of e-cigarettes happened: to mimic closely the smoking process but without the associated health risks. If you are thinking of adopting vaping to replace traditional smoking, you should first determine if you would like an e-liquid containing nicotine or not. Some smokers may find themselves not requiring the nicotine since they are able to satisfy their urges through the act of vaping. If you do prefer taking the nicotine route, you need to choose a nicotine strength that depends on the number of cigarettes that you currently smoke on a daily basis. You need to understand that the effects of nicotine usually differ depending on the method of delivery that you use. For instance, research shows that people that vape usually take in lower amounts of nicotine per puff than traditional smokers. In part 2 of the series, we will be focusing on how much nicotine is contained in cigarettes and reveal the amount of nicotine that smokers consume.\n\nShort term effects of tobacco\nWhen a person smokes a cigarette, the body responds immediately to the chemical nicotine in the smoke. Nicotine causes a short-term increase in blood pressure, heart rate, and the flow of blood from the heart. It also causes the arteries to narrow. Carbon monoxide reduces the amount of oxygen the blood can carry. This, combined with the effects produced by nicotine, creates an imbalance in the demand for oxygen by the cells and the amount of oxygen the blood is able to supply. Long term effetcs of tobacco\nMost people think of cancer when they think of tobacco use. Tobacco does cause a wide variety of devastating cancers. However, tobacco kills even more people through heart disease and stroke than it does through cancer! About 181,000 people die each year in the United States from smoking-related heart disease and stroke, and about 158,000 die from smoking-related cancer. The remainder of the smoking-related deaths, 123,000, are from lung diseases other than cancer. - Hypertension (high blood pressure.) - Congestive heart failure — Ineffective pumping of the heart leads to an accumulation of fluid in the lungs. - Coronary heart disease – Narrowed arteries lead to heart attack and death. - Heart attacks and congestive heart failure. - Blocked blood vessels. - Strokes – Blocked bloodflow to the brain or bleeding in the brain. Stroke is a major killer. - Smoking causes cancer of the lung, oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, pancreas, kidney, bladder and cervix. Recent evidence links smoking with cancer of large intestine and some forms of leukemia. - Most deaths from lung cancer are caused by smoking\n- Although other factors can cause lung cancer, smoking is responsible for 85% of all new cases of lung cancer in Canada. - Lung cancer is a highly lethal disease; only a small minority of patients are alive five years after diagnosis. - The causal relationship between smoking and cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus has been established for many years. Smokeless tobacco also causes cancer of the mouth. - Like all tobacco-caused diseases, the risk increases with amount and duration of smoking. Alcohol consumption is also a risk factor for these cancers, and the combination of alcohol consumption and smoking results in a greatly increased risk. - Recent studies confirm earlier findings of a strong link between smoking and cancer of the pancreas and with cancer of the kidney and bladder. - Recent findings also suggest that smoking may be a previously unrecognized cause of cancer of the large intestine (colorectal cancer) in both men and women. Evidence is also growing concerning a link between smoking and some forms of leukemia. - Emphysema — The very small airways (bronchioles) that join the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs lose elasticity. Patient loses ability to exhale fully, and chemical balance in the blood is disturbed. There is no cure for emphysema. - Chronic Bronchitis — The airways of the lungs change shape and size and the mucous glands are enlarged, causing coughing and production of sputum. - Abnormal sperm cells. - Difficulty maintaining pregnancy. - Menstrual disorders and early menopause\n- Smoking during pregnancy can lead to:\n- Miscarriage or stillbirth. - Low birth weight –\n- Babies born to mothers who smoke during pregnancy weigh on the average between 200 to 300 grams less than other babies. - Premature birth –\n- Both low birth weight and premature birth can lead to breathing and other health problems. - Learning and behavior problems later in childhood. - Sudden Infant Death Syndrome or “crib death” — Seemingly healthy babies die without warning. - More upper respiratory problems, ear complications, or asthma when exposed to tobacco prior to birth. - Prematurely wrinkled skin. - Permanent gum and tooth loss. - Lost or weakened sense of taste. - Weakened immune system. - Stomach ulcers. - Unwanted weight loss.

Just how far the negative health effects of cigarettes reach, however, may come as a surprise to many. A new study from Emory University has linked smoking cigarettes with degenerative disc disease in the cervical spine, a condition which can cause chronic neck pain. The cervical spine is located in the neck and is comprised of vertebrae, as well as cervical discs, which sit between the vertebrae and absorb shock to the spine. As people get older, these discs dehydrate and shrink, which can cause chronic pain to develop. \"Smoking is not healthy for a person’s intervertebral discs given the risk of developing microvascular disease — a disease of the small blood vessels — due to nicotine abuse,\" said lead investigator Mitchel Leavitt, MD, in a press release. Dr. Leavitt is a resident doctor in Emory’s Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. Intervertebral discs get their nourishment from the microvasculature system, a small system of blood vessels that line either side of the discs. Nicotine can damage these blood vessels, causing the discs to receive improper nourishment and degenerate faster. Although past research has linked smoking to disc degeneration in the lumbar spine (near the base of the spine), none have linked smoking with degeneration in the cervical spine. This study looked at the CT scans of 182 patients who were scanned for various reasons, more than half of whom were women and 34 percent of whom were smokers. Researchers asked a radiologist with training in neuroradiology and a physiatrist to review these scans. Each disc was rated on a scale between 0 and 3 (as normal, mild, moderate or severe) depending on how much it had degenerated. A cumulative score between 0 and 15 was then given for the entire cervical spine. Dr. Leavitt and team also looked at how often patients smoked and for how long, and then adjusted for health factors such as age, body mass index, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. On average, current smokers were more likely to have cervical degenerative disc disease. Age made the disease worse, but coexisting conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high BMI did not. \"This is another example of the detrimental effects of smoking,\" Dr. Leavitt said. \"Pain and spine clinics are filled with patients who suffer chronic neck and back pain, and this study provides the physician with more ammunition to use when educating them about their need to quit smoking.\" The study was presented Feb. 18 at the Association of Academic Physiatrists' Annual Meeting in Sacramento, CA.

ABSTRACT Tobacco smoking increases the risk of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) and back pain, but the mechanisms underlying the adverse effects of smoking are largely unknown. Current hypotheses predict that smoking contributes to IDD indirectly through nicotine-mediated vasoconstriction which limits the exchange of nutrients between the discs and their surroundings. We alternatively hypothesize that direct contact of disc cells, that is, cells in the outermost annulus and those present along fissures in degenerating discs, with the vascular system containing soluble tobacco smoking constituents could perturb normal metabolic activities resulting in IDD. In this study, we tested our hypothesis by comparing the effects of direct exposure of human disc cells to tobacco smoke condensate and nicotine on cell viability and metabolic activity. We showed that smoke condensate, which contains all of the water-soluble compounds inhaled by smokers, exerts greater detrimental effects on human disc cell viability and metabolism than nicotine. Smoke condensate greatly induced an inflammatory response and gene expression of metalloproteinases while reduced active matrix synthesis and expression of matrix structural genes. Therefore, we have demonstrated that disc cell exposure to the constituents of tobacco smoke has negative consequences which have the potential to alter disc matrix homeostasis. - SourceAvailable from: PubMed Central[Show abstract] [Hide abstract]\nABSTRACT: The purpose of the present study was to simultaneously examine the transcript levels of a large number of interleukins (ILs; IL-9, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-16, IL-17, IL-18, IL-26, and IL-27) and investigate their correlation with the clinicopathological profiles of patients with tuberculous intervertebral discs.PLoS ONE 01\/2014; 9(6):e101324. · 3.53 Impact Factor\n- [Show abstract] [Hide abstract]\nABSTRACT: Cigarette smoking has deleterious effects on the musculo-skeletal system.

These cells experience nutrient starvation, acidic stress, hypoxic stress, hyperglycemic stress, osmotic stress, and mechanical stress. Understanding the detailed responses and complex adaptive mechanisms of disc cells to various stresses might provide some clues to guide therapy for disc degeneration. By reviewing the published literatures describing disc cells under different hostile microenvironments, we conclude that these cells exhibit different responses to microenvironmental stresses with different mechanisms. Moreover, the interaction and combination of these stresses create a complex environment that synergistically increase or decrease influences on disc cells, compared with the effects of a single stress.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:bafe38fc-6bf3-468e-94be-7ebd726b62ad>"]},{"passage":"Facts About Tobacco Consumption\nTobacco contains nicotine, which was named after a plant called Nicotania tabacum, which was named after a French guy Nicot de Villemain. During 16th century, he planted the plant in Paris and promoted it. This alkaloid is almost 3% of tobacco’s dry weight and it mostly contains leaves and roots. But smaller amount of it found in other plants like potatoes, tomatoes, eggplants, leaves of coca plants and green peppers. Did you know that in the late 17th century, nicotine was used as pesticides? Yes, it is true! The antihervivore effect of nicotine can be very lethal, especially to insects. Likewise, Nicotine sulfate was also considered to be the most potent botanical insecticide that was available for home gardeners as it was very harmful to humans and was quickly absorbed through the skin. That is why, in 2008, the United States of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) banned the use of nicotine-based pesticides. Effects About tobacco Consumption\nIn higher doses, between 30 to 60 mg, nicotine can be very lethal to humans and deterrent to insects, making it neurotoxic chemical. However, in smaller doses, 1mg or smaller present in cigarette, it acts as a stimulant. In smaller doses, nicotine will not affect the health of the human beings. But in higher doses, it is very harmful to the health of the human beings. There are many side effects due to the tobacco consumption. - Affects nervous system\nNicotine mostly affects your nervous system and helps reduce your appetite, relieves depression, boosts mood, improves memory and cognition, and enhances train activity. However, it also increases salivation, stimulates intestinal motility, increases both the blood pressure and heart rate, and may even cause vomiting and nausea. - Nicotine Addiction\nAlthough it takes only 1mg of nicotine in one cigarette to stimulate your brain, however, this single stick would be sufficient enough to cause you addiction to it too. Your brain is responsible in creating neurotransmitters, which thus creates emotions and sensations you feel within you. But when you inhale nicotine, it masks those neurotransmitters, thus deceiving neurons and replacing the substance called acetylcholine on its receptors. The nicotine then goes on to produce an abnormal amount of dopamine, causing euphoria. After smoking, the euphoria ceases because the nicotine effect has gone. Thus, when this feel-good sensation is gone, you might be attempted to have that feeling again. That is why, most people need another cigarette to revive that euphoria. This cycle continues, and then eventually, the addiction increases. - Chronic Withdrawal Symptoms\nSometimes, smokers may also want to quit smoking, and while doing so, they may experience mild to chronic withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, intense craving for nicotine, depression, trouble sleeping, drowsiness, headaches, frustration, inability to concentrate, and weight loss. These symptoms will be at its highest for at least 2-3 days after you’ve stopped smoking. The withdrawal symptoms may be even more frequent among people who used to smoke more sticks per day or who had longer years or smoking. But nicotine addicts are trying to avoid these same symptoms, and thus, they prolong their recovery and addiction to nicotine. There are number of diagnostics available today to detect nicotine in your body. When you inhale smoke, nicotine is metabolized into cotinine in vital organs such as the liver and lungs, which then is eventually expelled through the urine. Apart from nicotine, cotinine is a good indicator for nicotine use, detectable in saliva, urine, and the blood. - Length Of Time Nicotine Stay In The Bod\nIt depends on the number of tobacco you smoke every day, and the number of years you’ve smoked till today, and also the type of nicotine test done. In short, it may be 2 days, or it may stay as long as 3 months. - Nicotine Blood Test\nTo detect nicotine use, both quantitative and qualitative blood tests can be used. The presence, or the absence, or the blood nicotine levels can be figured out.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:5d90f364-0e12-4570-af17-d6e8974bc88f>"]},{"passage":"The Discs of the Spine: An Overview\nThe bones of the spine are separated by tough cartilage pads called intervertebral discs (inter = “between”; vertebral = “bones of the spine”). Healthy discs are thick and flexible (like a wet sponge) allowing a wide range of bending and twisting motions. An unhealthy disc is stiff and hard (like a dry sponge) and prone to injuries such as bulging or herniation. Over time gravity, spinal joint dysfunction and accumulated trauma cause the discs to compress, flatten and degenerate. This constant compression prevents much-needed oxygen and nutrients from entering the disc. This ongoing starvation causes the once-tough outer layers of the disc to soften allowing the disc to become injured or diseased. Disc damage can occur anywhere in the spine. However, the discs of the neck (cervical spine) and low back (lumbar spine) are the most commonly injured. |Disc Bulge (A)||Herniated Disc (B)||Disk Rupture (C)|\nDisease of the spinal discs can take many forms. Significant disc damage can lead to a Disc Bulge, become a tear called a Disc Herniation or the inner gelatinous material of the disc can leak out in the case of a Ruptured Disc. The “jelly center” of the disc can also dry out over time which is referred to as Degenerative Disc Disease. All forms of disc injury can eventually impinge on the nerves exiting the spine (“Pinched Nerve”) which can create numbness, tingling, burning or sharp pain down the arms or legs. Sharp pain originating from the back and “shooting” down the legs is often referred to as Sciatica. Introduction to Degenerative Disc Disease\nIn order to understand the condition of Degenerative Disc Disease one must know two main facts about discs:\n- Spinal discs do NOT have a direct blood supply. There are no arteries that feed the disc with oxygen and nutrients. Therefore, discs of the spine must receive their oxygen and nutrients from a different source. Normal, healthy discs are “fed” and oxygenated by the constant recycling of the disc fluid that occurs with spinal joint movement. This joint motion “sucks” in fluid filled with oxygen and nutrients and “pumps out” waste fluid. This process of fluid diffusion is greatly affected by internal disc pressure (intradiscal pressure) which brings us to key point #2:\n- The discs of the spine are under constant pressure. The spinal discs are designed to absorb shock and maintain spinal flexibility by acting as cushions during body movement. The discs act similar to shock absorbers in a car. Car shock absorbers maintain a constant pressure to “push back” against the weight and movement of the car. Spinal discs act in a similar fashion. The pressure within the discs pushes the bones of the spine apart preventing them from crashing into one another during activities like running and jumping. Unfortunately, this constant internal disc pressure also pushes the fluid out of the disc consistently every day. This makes it difficult for the body to “suck” in new, healthy disc fluid with its much-needed oxygen and nutrients. These two factors make it difficult for the body to maintain thick, plump, healthy discs making Degenerative Disc Disease one of the more common spinal ailments. |Degenerative Disc Disease: As the disc degenerates it loses height (Disc Height Reduction) allowing the bones above and below to “sandwich” the nerve between them.|\nDegenerative Disc Disease, as the name implies, is caused by the progressive degeneration of the intervertebral disc. Nearly every physical activity (no matter how simple) places strain upon these discs. Over time, repeated daily stress and minor traumas begin to weaken the discs of the spine. This process of accumulated wear and tear will eventually lead to disc degeneration commonly referred to as Degenerative Disc Disease. The process of disc degeneration often begins with a chronic lack of oxygen and nutrients. This can occur because of 1) greater than normal compression of the disc or 2) as a result of decreased hydration.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:98323d54-2e04-4c69-b3f0-aed4fe55fc3e>"]},{"passage":"- Lumbar disc herniation is a common cause of lower back pain and can result from age-related degeneration, physical trauma, genetic predisposition, or lifestyle factors. - Symptoms include lower back pain, sciatica, and numbness or tingling in the legs. - Treatment options range from conservative approaches like rest, medication, and physical therapy to alternative treatments like chiropractic care and acupuncture. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary. - Prevention strategies include regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, proper lifting techniques, and good posture. - A comprehensive, customized treatment plan can help individuals overcome lumbar disc herniation and return to their favorite activities pain-free. Anatomy and Physiology\nOur spine is a fascinating and complex structure that plays a crucial role in supporting our bodies and allowing us to move freely. To better understand how injuries to the discs occur, it's essential first to understand the anatomy and physiology of the spine. Structure of the Spine\nOur spine is made up of 33 vertebrae stacked on top of each other. These vertebrae are separated by intervertebral discs, which act as shock absorbers and provide flexibility to the spine. The vertebrae are the individual bones that make up the spine. They are divided into different regions: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal. Each vertebra is a uniquely shaped bone that provides support and stability to the spine. The vertebrae are connected by facet joints, allowing smooth and controlled movements. The vertebral column also serves as the protective canal for the spinal cord, which transmits signals between the brain and the rest of the body. Intervertebral discs are the spongy, cartilaginous pads found between the vertebrae. They are composed of an outer fibrous ring called the annulus fibrosus and an inner gel-like substance called the nucleus pulposus. Functions of the Intervertebral Discs\nIntervertebral discs play two primary roles in the overall function and health of the spine:\nOne of the primary functions of the intervertebral discs is to act as a shock absorber for the spine during everyday activities. This shock-absorbing capacity helps protect the vertebrae and prevent injuries. However, the discs can wear down over time, making them less effective at absorbing shock. This wear and tear can increase the risk of conditions like lumbar disc herniation. What Is A Lumbar Disc Herniation? A lumbar disc herniation occurs when the outer layer of an intervertebral disc tears, allowing the soft inner material to bulge or leak out. This can cause nerve compression and pain, numbness, or weakness. Here are the common causes:\nAs we age, the intervertebral discs lose some water content and become less flexible. This process, known as disc degeneration, can make the discs more susceptible to tearing and herniation. Age-related degeneration is a common cause of lumbar disc herniation, highlighting the significance of preserving a healthy spine throughout one's life. Physical Trauma or Injury\nSudden physical trauma or injury, such as a fall, a car accident, or a sports injury, can cause damage to the intervertebral discs and lead to lumbar disc herniation. In these cases, prompt treatment is crucial to minimize long-term damage and prevent chronic pain. Some individuals may have a genetic predisposition to lumbar disc herniation, and research has found several inherited factors that affect intervertebral disc structure and strength. While you cannot change your genetics, understanding your family history can help you take proactive measures to protect your spine and reduce the risk of herniation. Several lifestyle factors can contribute to lumbar disc herniation, including:\nA sedentary lifestyle can weaken the muscles that support the spine. That lack of stabilizer strength increases pressure on the intervertebral discs, resulting in a higher risk of herniation. Physical activity and targeted exercises can help maintain a strong and healthy spine. Poor posture can place additional stress on the intervertebral discs and increase the risk of herniation. It can be static (think sitting or standing) or dynamic (think how you lift things). Excess body weight can put extra pressure on the intervertebral discs, making them more prone to damage and herniation.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:9bb3f506-f6c3-4742-a09a-96f0ed637df9>"]},{"passage":"When you talk to most people about serious health risks, it’s almost a guarantee that smoking will be brought up. After all, stopping smoking is one of the single most important things one can do to reduce their risk of cancer and heart disease and start to feel better physically as a whole. But at Joseph R. Giove Clinical Hypnosis, I’ve noticed that a number of people don’t fully understand just what it is about smoking that keeps them coming back or what damages their health. While things like the tar and the various carcinogens within a cigarette are understood, the various health effects of nicotine aren’t as widely talked about. This is especially problematic since many people switch from smoking cigarettes to using electronic cigarettes or even nicotine gum or patches. They’re still getting their nicotine, but through method that doesn’t come with the tar and the more than 4,000 toxic chemicals found in cigarette smoke. However, what they don’t realize is that nicotine itself has a variety of impacts on the human body and its overall health and wellbeing. In other words, using any kind of nicotine product is something you should stop doing. Otherwise you’ll be putting yourself at risk for a variety of health issues. What Is Nicotine? First, it’s worth understanding the basics of what nicotine itself actually is. There are a few basic points that can help explain this to you clearly. - Nicotine is a type of compound known as a parasympathomimetic alkaloid. - It’s found in the leaves of the nightshade family of plants and heavily in tobacco plants. - It makes up between 0.6 and 3% of the total dry weight of tobacco. In short, it’s a chemical compound found in plants. But beyond that, nicotine is a drug – just like the many illegal drugs available throughout the country. It acts as a stimulant, and also triggers various psychoactive effects on the user. This includes feelings of relaxation, appetite reduction, and mood elevation. It works as a stimulant and a relaxant and as such is a bit different from many other drugs out there. The Many Health Effects\nNow it’s time to get into the health effects of nicotine. When a cigarette is smoked, the nicotine is absorbed by the lungs and enters the blood, reaching the brain in about seven seconds in most cases. This triggers the release of a variety of different chemicals like dopamine and serotonin, which brings the calming effect with it. But that nicotine-rich blood is now moving throughout the body and can have a wide range of impacts on it. The various health effects of nicotine include the following. - A serious increase in blood pressure and heart rate, which can trigger angina and other heart related issues. This is especially true in patients already suffering from some form of heart related illness. - An increase in the chance of developing cardiovascular disease has been linked to nicotine use as well. This applies to nicotine no matter how it is used to enter the body, from patches to smoking and beyond. - Nicotine can trigger a variety of different gastrointestinal problems. This includes nausea, diarrhea, and peptic ulcers. - It also leads to dry mouth and heartburn. - Nicotine has been linked to headaches, dizziness, and abnormal sleeping patterns. - The impact of nicotine on the circulatory system is especially profound, and it has been linked to an increase in the chance of clots, an enlarged aorta, damaged vessels, and more. It’s true that currently there are only mild links between cancer and nicotine itself, though researchers disagree as to whether or not the use of nicotine will lead to cancer. Some studies have shown that it can occur, and that tumor growth is increased directly by nicotine. In other words, the risk of cancer from nicotine is something worth paying attention to – just because you’re not smoking doesn’t mean you’re not placing yourself at an added risk. Pregnant Women, Fetuses, And Nicotine\nPregnant women in particular need to avoid the use of nicotine. No matter how the chemical enters the body, it will find its way into the bloodstream and will then be passed to the unborn child.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:3333a0ac-7f61-4293-b595-b8ad37fe5a5d>"]},{"passage":"In the mid-twentieth century smoking in the United States was often associated with romance, relaxation, and adventure; movie stars oozed glamour on screen while smoking, and movie tough guys were never more masculine than when lighting up. Songs such as \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\" topped the hit parade. Smoking became a rite of passage for many young males and a sign of increasing independence for women. Since the 1990s, however, there has been an increase of opposition to tobacco use. Health authorities warn of the dangers of smoking and chewing tobacco, and nonsmokers object to secondhand smoke—because of both the smell and the health dangers of breathing smoke from other people's cigarettes. Today, a smoker is more likely to ask for permission before lighting up, and the answer is often \"no.\" Because of health concerns, smoking has been banned on airplanes, in hospitals, and in many workplaces, restaurants, and bars. PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF NICOTINE\nTobacco is a plant native to the Western Hemisphere. It contains nicotine, a drug classified as a stimulant, although it has some depressive effects as well. Nicotine is a poisonous alkaloid that is the major psychoactive (mood-altering) ingredient in tobacco. (Alkaloids are carbon- and nitrogen-containing compounds that are found in some families of plants. They have both poisonous and medicinal properties.) Nicotine's effects on the body are complex. The drug affects the brain and central nervous system as well as the hypothalamus and pituitary glands of the endocrine (hormone) system. Nicotine easily crosses the blood-brain barrier (a series of capillaries and cells that controls the flow of substances from the blood to the brain), and it accumulates in the brain—faster than caffeine or heroin, but slower than diazepam (a sedative medicine used to treat anxiety). In the brain nicotine imitates the actions of the hormone epinephrine (adrenaline) and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, both of which heighten awareness. Nicotine also triggers the release of dopamine, which enhances feelings of pleasure, and endorphins, \"the brain's natural opiates,\" which have a calming effect. As noted earlier, nicotine acts as both a stimulant and a depressant. By stimulating certain nerve cells in the spinal cord, nicotine relaxes the nerves and slows some reactions, such as the knee-jerk reflex. Small amounts of nicotine stimulate some nerve cells, but these cells are depressed by large amounts. In addition, nicotine stimulates the brain cortex (the outer layer of the brain) and affects the functions of the heart and lungs. TRENDS IN TOBACCO USE\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the consumption of cigarettes, the most widely used tobacco product, has decreased over the past generation among adults. After increasing rather consistently for sixty years, the per capita (per person) consumption of cigarettes peaked in the 1960s at well over four thousand cigarettes per year (\"Chronic Disease Notes and Reports,\" Fall 2001, http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nccdphp\/publications\/cdnr\/pdf\/CDNRfall2001.pdf). The steady decline in smoking came shortly after 1964, when the Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service (January 1964, http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/Tobacco\/sgr\/sgr_1964\/sgr64.htm) concluded that cigarette smoking is a cause of lung and laryngeal cancer in men, a probable cause of lung cancer in women, and the most important cause of chronic bronchitis in both genders. By 2006 the annual per capita consumption of cigarettes for those aged eighteen and over was 1,691. (See Table 3.1.)","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:3db9fb8a-c3d7-4f60-bd54-3dc0861a8184>"]},{"passage":"- We strive to provide complete care for our patients. Learn more about all the services we provide. Your Spine 101\nAn adult human spine typically consists of 26 moveable segments: seven cervical vertebras, twelve thoracic vertebras, five lumbar vertebras, one sacrum, and one coccyx (tailbone). Intervertebral discs separate the segments from the second cervical vertebra down to the sacrum and a thinner disc is present between the sacrum and coccyx. Intervertebral discs comprise about 25% of the height of an adult spine. Intervertebral joints connect vertebras and these joints are lined by lubricating synovial membranes. All of these structures are designed and built to last a lifetime. Intervertebral discs, which are gel-like colloids, begin to lose their water content at about age 2. This slow resorption is perfectly normal. Nothing lasts forever, and all living structures degrade and deteriorate over time. With this in mind, we can understand how it is that x-rays of older persons show various degrees of degeneration or arthritis of the spinal joints and intervertebral discs. These physiological changes are ominously or portentously referred to as \"degenerative disc disease\" by certain specialists, but it is important to remember that these structures deteriorate naturally. Degeneration or breakdown of spinal joints and intervertebral discs is not a disease, but rather a standard process that occurs over time, more rapidly in some persons than in others. There are measures we can employ to resist the effects of spinal degenerative changes and possibly even slow the process of degeneration itself. Spinal degenerative changes are problematic as they result in loss of resilience, flexibility, and mobility of the spine as a whole. The overall result is degradation of spinal function and increased possibility for strains, sprains, and other injuries. Solutions are available, as research studies have consistently demonstrated that regular vigorous exercise and healthy nutrition provide significant benefit in maintaining spinal structure and function. Regular vigorous exercise such as walking, running, bike riding, and strength training provide consistent weight bearing stress to spinal joints and intervertebral discs. Such mechanical stresses are required for these structures to retain their physiological integrity. For example, exercise pumps fluid back into intervertebral discs and increases lubrication of spinal joints. Healthy eating provides the nutrients required to support efficient repair and replacement of the cells and tissues of spinal structural components. Thus, by choosing to implement healthy lifestyles, we help keep our spines in peak physical condition and become better able to withstand the negative effects of natural physiological forces occurring over time. Having a healthy spine also depends on getting regular chiropractic care. Exercise, good nutrition, and sufficient rest are the primary requirements for spinal health, but there may be limitations and restrictions in the form of spinal joint dysfunction and nerve interference. These limitations prevent your spine from achieving optimal function and may lead to stiffness, loss of mobility, ongoing pain, and even injury. By detecting and correcting spinal joint dysfunction, regular chiropractic care helps eliminate sources of nerve interference and enables your spine to do its job, which includes handling heavy mechanical loads and moving you around during all your activities throughout the day. Regular chiropractic care partners with your other healthy lifestyle choices to help you achieve high levels of health and well-being now and into the future. - Geusens PP, van den Bergh JP: Osteoporosis and osteoarthritis: shared mechanisms and epidemiology.

Everybody understands the dangers associated with cigarette use but is nicotine by itself dangerous? How much nicotine do cigarettes exactly contain? Moreover, does nicotine occur naturally in tobacco or are the tobacco companies responsible for adding it? Where does the nicotine found in e-liquids come from? What is Nicotine and What Are Its Origins? Let us begin with the simpler question: Does nicotine occur naturally in tobacco? Nicotine is definitely an alkaloid present in tobacco and various other members of the nightshade family including peppers, tomatoes, potatoes, and eggplant. You can rightly state that humanity has been consumers of nicotine for millennia since tobacco cultivation started in the Americas about 6,000 B.C. Back then people most likely smoked or chewed it. Even Christophe Columbus himself actually received a gift of dried tobacco once he arrived in the Bahamas. He even carried tobacco seeds and leaves with him back to Europe. The Evolution of Nicotine\nNicot de Villemain, who was the French diplomat responsible for the introduction of tobacco to the Queen of France who then used it for treating her headaches was whom nicotine was named in honor of. You might not believe it but tobacco was at a time believed to have medicinal qualities. However, as early as the 17th Century, doctors had started discovering a correlation between the use of tobacco and diseases like cancer. Over 25 million pounds of tobacco were being cultivated annually around the same time in the Jamestown colony alone, thus making it a top export of the American colonies. It is worth noting that consuming nicotine alone is not believed to be the root of health problems related to smoking. Tobacco and even cigarettes themselves contain other chemicals that are known to be carcinogenic. Nicotine was once believed to be the key driver of dependency on tobacco but new evidence suggests that those other chemicals actually play a greater role in cigarette addiction. Interestingly, recent studies have revealed that nicotine by itself might actually possess some medicinal properties. Researchers from all over the world are successfully experimenting with using nicotine for treating Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s, and even depression. The Use of Nicotine Today\nA large number of people still consume nicotine from various tobacco products including cigars, cigarettes, or even chewing tobacco. Nicotine is obviously found in some e-liquids and nicotine patches. The nicotine used in nicotine replacement therapies is actually extracted from tobacco but it is sometimes manufactured artificially. The theory behind nicotine replacement is that it works by mitigating the withdrawal effects of tobacco. We currently understand that addiction to cigarettes has several different facets, which is the reason why the development of e-cigarettes happened: to mimic closely the smoking process but without the associated health risks. If you are thinking of adopting vaping to replace traditional smoking, you should first determine if you would like an e-liquid containing nicotine or not. Some smokers may find themselves not requiring the nicotine since they are able to satisfy their urges through the act of vaping. If you do prefer taking the nicotine route, you need to choose a nicotine strength that depends on the number of cigarettes that you currently smoke on a daily basis. You need to understand that the effects of nicotine usually differ depending on the method of delivery that you use. For instance, research shows that people that vape usually take in lower amounts of nicotine per puff than traditional smokers. In part 2 of the series, we will be focusing on how much nicotine is contained in cigarettes and reveal the amount of nicotine that smokers consume.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:d346b643-d24f-4d27-b93d-2ce56fa23091>"]},{"passage":"Short term effects of tobacco\nWhen a person smokes a cigarette, the body responds immediately to the chemical nicotine in the smoke. Nicotine causes a short-term increase in blood pressure, heart rate, and the flow of blood from the heart. It also causes the arteries to narrow. Carbon monoxide reduces the amount of oxygen the blood can carry. This, combined with the effects produced by nicotine, creates an imbalance in the demand for oxygen by the cells and the amount of oxygen the blood is able to supply. Long term effetcs of tobacco\nMost people think of cancer when they think of tobacco use. Tobacco does cause a wide variety of devastating cancers. However, tobacco kills even more people through heart disease and stroke than it does through cancer! About 181,000 people die each year in the United States from smoking-related heart disease and stroke, and about 158,000 die from smoking-related cancer. The remainder of the smoking-related deaths, 123,000, are from lung diseases other than cancer. - Hypertension (high blood pressure.) - Congestive heart failure — Ineffective pumping of the heart leads to an accumulation of fluid in the lungs. - Coronary heart disease – Narrowed arteries lead to heart attack and death. - Heart attacks and congestive heart failure. - Blocked blood vessels. - Strokes – Blocked bloodflow to the brain or bleeding in the brain. Stroke is a major killer. - Smoking causes cancer of the lung, oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, pancreas, kidney, bladder and cervix. Recent evidence links smoking with cancer of large intestine and some forms of leukemia. - Most deaths from lung cancer are caused by smoking\n- Although other factors can cause lung cancer, smoking is responsible for 85% of all new cases of lung cancer in Canada. - Lung cancer is a highly lethal disease; only a small minority of patients are alive five years after diagnosis. - The causal relationship between smoking and cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus has been established for many years. Smokeless tobacco also causes cancer of the mouth. - Like all tobacco-caused diseases, the risk increases with amount and duration of smoking. Alcohol consumption is also a risk factor for these cancers, and the combination of alcohol consumption and smoking results in a greatly increased risk. - Recent studies confirm earlier findings of a strong link between smoking and cancer of the pancreas and with cancer of the kidney and bladder. - Recent findings also suggest that smoking may be a previously unrecognized cause of cancer of the large intestine (colorectal cancer) in both men and women. Evidence is also growing concerning a link between smoking and some forms of leukemia. - Emphysema — The very small airways (bronchioles) that join the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs lose elasticity. Patient loses ability to exhale fully, and chemical balance in the blood is disturbed. There is no cure for emphysema. - Chronic Bronchitis — The airways of the lungs change shape and size and the mucous glands are enlarged, causing coughing and production of sputum. - Abnormal sperm cells. - Difficulty maintaining pregnancy. - Menstrual disorders and early menopause\n- Smoking during pregnancy can lead to:\n- Miscarriage or stillbirth. - Low birth weight –\n- Babies born to mothers who smoke during pregnancy weigh on the average between 200 to 300 grams less than other babies. - Premature birth –\n- Both low birth weight and premature birth can lead to breathing and other health problems. - Learning and behavior problems later in childhood. - Sudden Infant Death Syndrome or “crib death” — Seemingly healthy babies die without warning. - More upper respiratory problems, ear complications, or asthma when exposed to tobacco prior to birth. - Prematurely wrinkled skin. - Permanent gum and tooth loss. - Lost or weakened sense of taste. - Weakened immune system. - Stomach ulcers. - Unwanted weight loss.

J.Crew sizing is different from H&M sizing, and retailers can even be inconsistent across their own line. Sizing inconsistencies can be attributed to different fabrics, updated cuts of products bearing the same name, and even vanity sizing. When taking your measurements, be sure to use a cloth measuring tape (or other options that we recommend in the absence of one) — not a metal measuring tape. This will ensure that you’re measuring your body accurately. In addition, measure only over bare skin or skin-tight clothes so as to ensure the most accurate measurements. What You Should Measure\nChest or Bust\nThis measurement is used for tops and dresses. Women: Place one end of the tape measure at the fullest part of your bust and wrap it around your body to get the measurement, keeping the tape parallel to the floor. Men and kids: Place one end of the tape measure at the center of your chest. Wrap it around your body, keeping the tape parallel to the floor. Bras are sized using a unique system based on two measurements of the bust area. For detailed instructions on how to measure to determine bra size and get a correct fit, please see: How to Measure for a Bra. This measurement is used for tops, dresses, and bottoms. Most clothing lines use the measurement of the “natural waist” for their size guides. To measure your natural waist, you want to find the narrowest part of your waist, located above your belly button and below your rib cage. Note some brands use a “low” waist measurement. For this, you would measure at the point where your trousers would normally ride.\n\nHow to Measure Your Body: Neck Around\nPlace the measuring tape around the neck at the height where the collar would normally rest. This will be just below your Adam’s apple. Stand relaxed. Do not crane your neck out or squeeze your chin down. The tape should be resting lightly on the skin, not squeezing it. Hold one finger under the tape measure to ensure some room for comfort. Do not try to account for shrinkage by adding extra here.

When taking your body measurements, wear the undergarments you normally wear for the most accurate results. Use a flexible tape measure, or a piece of string and ruler, and hold it around each body point so it is comfortably snug. If the tape is cutting into your flesh, it is too tight. To ensure an accurate measurement around your body, keep the measuring tape as level as possible from front to back. We recommend measuring yourself in front of a mirror so you can check this from a side view. If you can, get a friend to help you to ensure the most accurate measurements. Bust: Wrap the measuring tape around your back and where the tape meets across the fullest point of your bust is your bust measurement. Waist: Wrap the measuring tape around your natural waist, the slimmest part of your torso, pulling the ends to the front. Where they meet is your waist measurement. Hips: Wrap the measuring tape around the widest part of your bottom – this is usually low down towards your thighs. As with your bust and waist measurements, where the tape meets is your hip measurement. Length: To measure the length of individual garments against your body it is best to measure down the centre of your back. To do this, start the measuring tape at either the base of your neck for dresses and tops, or at your waist for skirts. Measure down your body to the measurement listed in the garment description. This will show you where the garment comes to on you. When you are measuring for length, remember to make sure you are standing completely upright – it is best to have someone help you with this. Alternatively, compare the measurement with the length of a garment you already have.

If you are making your own dress, you need to take your own measurements. If you are dressmaking for another person, you need to schedule a session so you can take the necessary and important body measurements. You should include the necessary measurement tools in your dressmaking kit. The basic tool for measuring sizes is a tape measure. You can use a nylon or plastic tape measure for the purpose. Use the English standard measurement (i.e. inches). Before proceeding to measure anyone, be sure the person is not wearing bulky outfit. Advise the person to come wearing well-fitted undergarments. This is because oversized underwear may drastically affect the accuracy of measurements. For women, bras should fit well, and for men, boxers and other loose underwear should not be worn when in the session. Make the person to be measured stand correctly and in good body posture. He or she should stand proudly, with eyes gazing straight ahead and both arms very relaxed at either side. The back should be ideally straight and shoulders in a relaxed state. Some people do not naturally stand this proud, but advise the person you are measuring to observe correct and proud standing for the sake of getting accurate and ideal body measurements. There is a need to take a good position base. When finally measuring, take note that the job does not end in measuring the bust, the waist, and the hips. Other body areas should also be measured correctly. There can be differences in procedures when measuring men and women, but there are general body areas to scale. • To measure the chest, put the tape measure under the person’s arms. Wrap the tape measure around the area, specifically to the fullest bust line part. • To measure the waist line, put the measuring tape at the person’s belly button. Let the tool fall naturally. The area where it fell is the waist line, the measurement you should take. • Measure the fullest part of the person’s hip. • To measure the arm length, place the tape measure at the top of the arm in the armpit area extending until the wrist. Bend the arm without taking off the tape. Take the measurement as the arm length. • Take back length measurement after determining the length from the base of the neck until the waistline. • Measure the length from hip to heel to get the accurate leg measurement. In taking measurements before dressmaking, it is a standard practice to measure the areas thrice in one session. There might be differences resulting from changes in positions and starting points of measurements. There is a need to do so to ensure measurement accuracy.\n\nThe best way is to find a freckle and use it every time. LOL! That's what I do. For record keeping, what matters most is consistency. As for measuring for clothing, I have no idea. I'm bad about the waist and the hips. Proper \"hip\" measurement for me seems more like my butt, not my hips. My hip bones are a lot higher than where I think my hips must actually be. Dr. Oz wants us to have a waist size of 32 or smaller and he allows for sucking in. I do not suck in, but that's just me. And I like to pull the tape pretty tight only because that way I can't second guess the way I do it each time. If I'm always pulling really tight then it's the same every time.\n\nHow many times have you stumbled upon a sweet deal online but never completed the purchase because you couldn’t figure out if the last one in your size would actually fit (and there were no returns, no exchanges)? Or have you ever found the perfect sport coat on eBay or Style Forum, but it didn’t have size tags and the seller simply listed the measurements? I mean, what the heck are you supposed to do with that, right? Am I right?! Well, let’s make sure this never happens to you again. Here’s the ONE tool you need to solve all your online shopping woes:\nLucky for you, you can find it on Amazon, in practically any big box store (Target, Walmart, Kmart), or in an arts and crafts store in your neighborhood, and it’ll cost you a few dollars at most. How is tailor’s tape going to solve all my online shopping woes? This little tool can measure every single square inch of that hot bod of yours. And those measurements are exactly what you need to make those confusing online purchases much easier. I don’t want to measure every square inch of my body. Okay, fine. I was over-exaggerating anyway. You really only need 6, maybe 7, measurements. That’s it! With those 6 (or 7) measurements, you can buy any garment anywhere without having to try it on. Pretty nifty, right? So what parts of my body should I measure? Good question. To make it easy, why not take a look at this handy dandy diagram below:\nHere are some descriptive definitions for the more confusing ones:\nSleeve length: Measure from the base of the neck, across the traps to the shoulder, down the arm, to your wrist bone. Chest: Measure the widest part of your chest, usually across the nipples (ooh la la). Natural waist: Your natural waist is generally where your torso bends if you were to stand straight with your legs shoulder width apart, and tipped over slightly to one side. That crease sorta in the middle of your ribs? That’s your natural waist. Hip: Where your pants typically sit. If you finger that area (wow, really?) you can feel your hip bone. Your tape should come right across there, parallel to the ground. Inseam: Measure from the inside of your thigh (this is too much) to the heel. These are the only measurements you’ll need.

You'll get the most accurate results on bare skin. However, make sure the tape is not squeezing into your skin. The number that meets the \"0\" after you have circled your entire waist is your waist measurement. Remove the tape and jot down your measurement for future reference. You may want to take your measurements in front of a full-length mirror to ensure you are measuring the right area and that the measuring tape isn't crooked. A healthy waistline for a woman is between 32 and 23 inches. For a man, it's between 45 and 32 inches. Make sure you use body measuring tape, which is made of fabric or bendable plastic.

By Samantha Eckert\nIf you do decide to shop, make it easier on yourself by knowing your measurements before you try on or order show clothes. With show clothing, it is important that everything fits correctly. If something is too tight or loose, it can compromise your overall appearance in the show pen. Buy a flexible measuring tape from your local craft or fabric store for the most accurate numbers. When measuring yourself, wear the same undergarments that you show in. Enlist the help of a friend to take the most accurate measurements. Be sure to write them all down and keep them with you while you are shopping. Learn Nicole Barnes’ secrets to perfect showmanship patterns in AQHA’s FREE Showmanship Basics report! Where to Measure\nThe basic measurements women will need to find a well-fitted jacket are: waist, bust, neck, hips, front width and back waist. It is important when measuring to not pull to tightly on the measuring tape. This is called a skin measurement. Stand relaxed, but with good posture. Start with your waist. Your natural waist is located between the bottom of your ribcage and your pelvis. This is the smallest part of your abdomen. Keep the tape parallel to the ground. Next, move to your bust. When measuring your bust, stand with your arms at about a 45 degree angle away from your body. Measure across the fullest part of the breasts, tape parallel to the floor. Your bust is not the same thing as your chest. In addition to Nicole’s secrets, Brad and Valerie Kearns explain why showmanship is the perfect event for people who can’t afford an expensive horse in AQHA’s FREE Showmanship Basics report. To measure your chest, stand with your arms in the same position as before and place the measuring tape around your back and under your armpits. The tape should go above the breasts and be pulled a little snug. Measure your neck to find the height most comfortable for a collar. Measure the base of your neck, not the middle, to find the circumference. To find the height put the measuring tape at the indentation at the front of your neck up to where it would feel comfortable for a collar to rest. Measure the length of your arm. Place the measuring tape at the tip of your shoulder, or sleeve seam, down to where the wrist bends. It is best to add an inch or more to allow for movement while riding. Your front width is from the crease where the arm meets the body to the crease on the other side, above the breasts and not across the fullest part. The arc of your bust is from the side seam of your top or shirt to the other side seam, across the fullest part of your breasts. Your back waist will help determine the length of your jacket. To measure your back waist, put the measuring tape at the nape of your neck. Then, measure the distance to where you would like your jacket to end. Showmanship jackets should end at the fullest part of your hips, anything longer will make your legs look short. Your hips are measured around the fullest part of your bottom with the tape parallel to the floor. For riding jackets you need to know where your chaps fit while you are mounted and riding. It is popular to have jackets that can be worn in multiple classes. If you are looking for a versatile jacket, be sure to know whether you want to wear it tucked in or left out while showing in riding classes. If you plan on wearing the jacket tucked in, be sure it is long enough that it will not un-tuck while riding and moving. If you plan on wearing the jacket un-tucked, it needs to fit over your chaps or hit just above them to show your belt buckle. Here are the top 24 photos we’ve picked for the AQHA calendar contest.

[flickr 28429325@N03 72157627705350992]\n\nA slew of made-to-your-measurements, one-of-a-kind clothing brands and sites have been popping up recently (Christina knows what I’m talking about—she shared her favorite customizable under-$100 summer dresses earlier). While I’m intrigued by the idea of getting a dress that’s made to fit my body exactly, the idea of measuring myself at home before sending in the numbers makes me nervous. What if I do it wrong and eventually unwrap a package that’s not as spot-on as it should be? Because I’m certain someone out there shares these anxieties, I quizzed Anne Dayton, founder and CEO of PIOL Dress, a new company that offers a handful of timeless dress silhouettes in all kinds of colors and patterns. Along with the precise fit, you’re guided to find the one that matches your complexion best via a favorite trick of Edith Head, one of Hollywood’s most illustrious costumers. With her answers, below, I think both you and I are headed toward some very well fitting garments, indeed. Q: Is it best to take measurements nude or while wearing something simple like a t-shirt and jeans? A: We ask you to measure yourself in the bra and underwear you’d most likely wear with the dress. Q: For the bust measurement, bra on or off? A: Definitely in your bra and, if possible, the one you’re most likely to be wearing with the dress. Q: In the ideal situation, should we ask a best friend to measure us rather than trying to do it ourselves? A: If you can ask someone to do it, that would be great. Otherwise, measure yourself in front of a full-length mirror to be sure the tape is parallel to the floor in the back. If the measuring tape isn’t even as it goes around your figure, the measurements could be off. Q: Are there any common mistakes people make when using a measuring tape? A: The most common mistake is to measure your high hip rather than your hip at their fullest point. The other one is to give us your bra size as the bust measurement—it’s not the same measurement at all. Q: Does it matter if measurements are taken first thing in the morning or at the end of the day? A: We haven’t really examined the difference of your measurements from morning to night. As you’ll be wearing the dress throughout the day, I’d imagine mid-day is the optimum time for measuring. Q: Real talk: Should we be trying to measure the “best” version of ourselves—standing up tall and straight with shoulders down and stomach in—or just how we typically stand? A: Standing straight, tall, and with feet together is the most desirable position. The one measurement that can move is the waistline. It’s very important that you breathe while measuring your waist, rather than holding in your breath or stomach. Our tailored style dress is very fitted in the bodice and waist, and if you measure your waist while holding your stomach in, the waistband could be too snug. One of the beauties of a custom-made dress is that it can be fitted to your figure, [but] still a pleasure to wear. Q: So fibbing numbers at all, for any reason, is a horrible idea? A: We truly need your real measurements. If you fib, the dress will be too tight and probably in the wrong places. If parts of the dress are too tight, you’re actually calling attention to that area. In terms of comfort, we’ve [considered that with] all our silhouettes, so there’s never a need to add to your measurements.","passages":[{"passage":"If you’re into online shopping, knowing your body measurements is a necessity to getting clothes in the right sizes.

Take the measurement as the arm length. • Take back length measurement after determining the length from the base of the neck until the waistline. • Measure the length from hip to heel to get the accurate leg measurement. In taking measurements before dressmaking, it is a standard practice to measure the areas thrice in one session. There might be differences resulting from changes in positions and starting points of measurements. There is a need to do so to ensure measurement accuracy.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:acff2e4f-1e57-4444-a0fd-caa7c72d5f42>"]},{"passage":"The best way is to find a freckle and use it every time. LOL!

I mean, what the heck are you supposed to do with that, right? Am I right?! Well, let’s make sure this never happens to you again. Here’s the ONE tool you need to solve all your online shopping woes:\nLucky for you, you can find it on Amazon, in practically any big box store (Target, Walmart, Kmart), or in an arts and crafts store in your neighborhood, and it’ll cost you a few dollars at most. How is tailor’s tape going to solve all my online shopping woes? This little tool can measure every single square inch of that hot bod of yours. And those measurements are exactly what you need to make those confusing online purchases much easier. I don’t want to measure every square inch of my body. Okay, fine. I was over-exaggerating anyway. You really only need 6, maybe 7, measurements. That’s it! With those 6 (or 7) measurements, you can buy any garment anywhere without having to try it on. Pretty nifty, right? So what parts of my body should I measure? Good question. To make it easy, why not take a look at this handy dandy diagram below:\nHere are some descriptive definitions for the more confusing ones:\nSleeve length: Measure from the base of the neck, across the traps to the shoulder, down the arm, to your wrist bone. Chest: Measure the widest part of your chest, usually across the nipples (ooh la la). Natural waist: Your natural waist is generally where your torso bends if you were to stand straight with your legs shoulder width apart, and tipped over slightly to one side. That crease sorta in the middle of your ribs? That’s your natural waist. Hip: Where your pants typically sit. If you finger that area (wow, really?) you can feel your hip bone. Your tape should come right across there, parallel to the ground. Inseam: Measure from the inside of your thigh (this is too much) to the heel. These are the only measurements you’ll need. Some tips on getting an accurate measurement\nThis is a little difficult to do if you’re on your own, unless you have something like this. If you’re not as fancy and you picked up traditional tailor’s tape, better get your patient significant other to help you out. Keep the tape straight\nIt’s really important to make sure the tape is level as your S.O. is wrapping it around your body parts (whoa). If it isn’t straight, chances are you’ll get a skewed measurement. An inch can make a big difference in the fit of your clothes, so make sure your designated measurer is as precise as possible. If you’re measuring your chest, waist, or hips, the tape should be parallel to the ground. Too loose = bad\nYou want to feel the tape wrapped around you. If it’s too loose, most likely it’s also not straight, so you’re going to get an inaccurate measurement no matter what. Too tight = bad\nYes, you want to feel the tape wrapped around you, but you don’t want to cinch it so snugly that your spare tire is cascading over it, enveloping the tape in a wall of skin and lard like some weird 80s horror film. Keep it firm, but not tight. Line it up\nHold one end, wrap the tape around your body, hold it firm, and match up the free end to the nearest line on the tape, like so:\nPretty simple, right? You want to do this for each of the areas listed in my handy dandy diagram above. Half or full? Some places give you measurements that look peculiarly small. For example, you may see a garment listed as having a 20″ chest measurement. Well that just means they measured across the chest without doubling the measurement. So your 40″ chest is 40″ because you went all the way around your body. While you’re at it, measure your clothes\nLet’s say you have a blazer that fits you perfectly.

The crease that forms indicates your natural waistline, directly above the belly button and below the ribcage. Wrap the measuring tape completely around your waist starting at the belly button. Begin at the spot on the tape where the measure reads \"0.\" Make sure the tape is level around your waistline--not too loose, not too tight. Do not place the measuring tape over clothes. You'll get the most accurate results on bare skin. However, make sure the tape is not squeezing into your skin. The number that meets the \"0\" after you have circled your entire waist is your waist measurement. Remove the tape and jot down your measurement for future reference. You may want to take your measurements in front of a full-length mirror to ensure you are measuring the right area and that the measuring tape isn't crooked.

How to measure hips. To measure the waist is quite useful, and especially to do it regularly. How to Measure Hips. Accurate hip measurements are important for having clothing made or assessing weight loss. To measure your hips, remove your outer garments, put your feet together, and wrap a soft measuring tape straight and snug. There are two body measurements vital to sizing for dresses, skirts and pants: those of your waist and hips. Although correct waist and hip measurements are not difficult to obtain, you can distort them through bad posture, tight clothing or not knowing the exact location of your natural waist. wikiHow Quick Video on How to Measure Hips.

By Samantha Eckert\nIf you do decide to shop, make it easier on yourself by knowing your measurements before you try on or order show clothes. With show clothing, it is important that everything fits correctly. If something is too tight or loose, it can compromise your overall appearance in the show pen. Buy a flexible measuring tape from your local craft or fabric store for the most accurate numbers. When measuring yourself, wear the same undergarments that you show in. Enlist the help of a friend to take the most accurate measurements. Be sure to write them all down and keep them with you while you are shopping. Learn Nicole Barnes’ secrets to perfect showmanship patterns in AQHA’s FREE Showmanship Basics report! Where to Measure\nThe basic measurements women will need to find a well-fitted jacket are: waist, bust, neck, hips, front width and back waist. It is important when measuring to not pull to tightly on the measuring tape. This is called a skin measurement. Stand relaxed, but with good posture. Start with your waist. Your natural waist is located between the bottom of your ribcage and your pelvis. This is the smallest part of your abdomen. Keep the tape parallel to the ground. Next, move to your bust. When measuring your bust, stand with your arms at about a 45 degree angle away from your body. Measure across the fullest part of the breasts, tape parallel to the floor. Your bust is not the same thing as your chest. In addition to Nicole’s secrets, Brad and Valerie Kearns explain why showmanship is the perfect event for people who can’t afford an expensive horse in AQHA’s FREE Showmanship Basics report. To measure your chest, stand with your arms in the same position as before and place the measuring tape around your back and under your armpits. The tape should go above the breasts and be pulled a little snug. Measure your neck to find the height most comfortable for a collar. Measure the base of your neck, not the middle, to find the circumference. To find the height put the measuring tape at the indentation at the front of your neck up to where it would feel comfortable for a collar to rest. Measure the length of your arm. Place the measuring tape at the tip of your shoulder, or sleeve seam, down to where the wrist bends. It is best to add an inch or more to allow for movement while riding. Your front width is from the crease where the arm meets the body to the crease on the other side, above the breasts and not across the fullest part. The arc of your bust is from the side seam of your top or shirt to the other side seam, across the fullest part of your breasts. Your back waist will help determine the length of your jacket. To measure your back waist, put the measuring tape at the nape of your neck. Then, measure the distance to where you would like your jacket to end. Showmanship jackets should end at the fullest part of your hips, anything longer will make your legs look short. Your hips are measured around the fullest part of your bottom with the tape parallel to the floor. For riding jackets you need to know where your chaps fit while you are mounted and riding. It is popular to have jackets that can be worn in multiple classes. If you are looking for a versatile jacket, be sure to know whether you want to wear it tucked in or left out while showing in riding classes. If you plan on wearing the jacket tucked in, be sure it is long enough that it will not un-tuck while riding and moving. If you plan on wearing the jacket un-tucked, it needs to fit over your chaps or hit just above them to show your belt buckle. Here are the top 24 photos we’ve picked for the AQHA calendar contest.

While I’m intrigued by the idea of getting a dress that’s made to fit my body exactly, the idea of measuring myself at home before sending in the numbers makes me nervous. What if I do it wrong and eventually unwrap a package that’s not as spot-on as it should be? Because I’m certain someone out there shares these anxieties, I quizzed Anne Dayton, founder and CEO of PIOL Dress, a new company that offers a handful of timeless dress silhouettes in all kinds of colors and patterns. Along with the precise fit, you’re guided to find the one that matches your complexion best via a favorite trick of Edith Head, one of Hollywood’s most illustrious costumers. With her answers, below, I think both you and I are headed toward some very well fitting garments, indeed. Q: Is it best to take measurements nude or while wearing something simple like a t-shirt and jeans? A: We ask you to measure yourself in the bra and underwear you’d most likely wear with the dress. Q: For the bust measurement, bra on or off? A: Definitely in your bra and, if possible, the one you’re most likely to be wearing with the dress. Q: In the ideal situation, should we ask a best friend to measure us rather than trying to do it ourselves? A: If you can ask someone to do it, that would be great. Otherwise, measure yourself in front of a full-length mirror to be sure the tape is parallel to the floor in the back. If the measuring tape isn’t even as it goes around your figure, the measurements could be off. Q: Are there any common mistakes people make when using a measuring tape? A: The most common mistake is to measure your high hip rather than your hip at their fullest point. The other one is to give us your bra size as the bust measurement—it’s not the same measurement at all. Q: Does it matter if measurements are taken first thing in the morning or at the end of the day? A: We haven’t really examined the difference of your measurements from morning to night. As you’ll be wearing the dress throughout the day, I’d imagine mid-day is the optimum time for measuring. Q: Real talk: Should we be trying to measure the “best” version of ourselves—standing up tall and straight with shoulders down and stomach in—or just how we typically stand? A: Standing straight, tall, and with feet together is the most desirable position. The one measurement that can move is the waistline. It’s very important that you breathe while measuring your waist, rather than holding in your breath or stomach. Our tailored style dress is very fitted in the bodice and waist, and if you measure your waist while holding your stomach in, the waistband could be too snug. One of the beauties of a custom-made dress is that it can be fitted to your figure, [but] still a pleasure to wear. Q: So fibbing numbers at all, for any reason, is a horrible idea? A: We truly need your real measurements. If you fib, the dress will be too tight and probably in the wrong places. If parts of the dress are too tight, you’re actually calling attention to that area. In terms of comfort, we’ve [considered that with] all our silhouettes, so there’s never a need to add to your measurements.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:9acdd04d-4522-4035-8c3e-51281bebee16>"]}]}

How does TMS help alleviate depression? TMS uses non-invasive electromagnetic energy to stimulate the brain. Research on TMS and depression have found that the electromagnetic pulses, when applied to depressed areas of the brain, activates neurons thought to be responsible for depression symptoms. Why would someone choose TMS Along with medication? Medications are often the first line of defense in treating depression. Most patients will respond favorably to antidepressants. However, sometimes people need additional help. TMS can help those who are experiencing treatment-resistant depression. Also, medications can come with a range of side effects and other issues. Some of the most common side effects of antidepressants are weight gain, stomach upset, dry mouth, drowsiness, and sexual dysfunction. When receiving TMS, it’s important to also work with your mental healthcare professional on finding the right medications for you. For patients who don’t respond to medications or therapy as well as they’d hoped, TMS may be the right choice for them. If you or a loved one are struggling with depression episodes that aren’t going away, contact Pulse TMS. Our technicians are standing by to answer your questions, so you can see if you’re a candidate for TMS treatment.\n\n- Follow the schedule through until the very end. - Stay in touch with your doctor and report any side effects. - Talk to a therapist.

TMS: TREAT YOUR DEPRESSION WITHOUT BRAIN ZAPS, WITHOUT MEDICATION\nMany people give up on their depression treatment if they experience side effects or they feel as though their current treatment isn’t working. Giving up on treatment can leave you feeling discouraged and hopeless. It can be demoralizing when the symptoms return after stopping the medication. It can also be dangerous, in the case of discontinuation syndrome, to unilaterally decide to stop treatment. If you have experienced side effects like brain shakes or brain zaps after stopping antidepressants or the symptoms have returned, don’t give up on treatment. It is possible to treat your depressionwithout brain zaps, without medication. Many people do get their depression under control with the right treatment. A non-invasive, no medication alternative to antidepressants is transcranial magnetic stimulation. TMS is a non-invasive treatment for people dealing with depression. Numerousresearch studies have been conducted to proveits effectiveness, and it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2008 for severe depression. It is also a good alternative for people who have not found relief from antidepressants due to their preponderance of systemic effects. Transcranial magnetic stimulation uses magnets to stimulate a specific area of the brain that is related to depression. TMS promotes new brain cell activity in this area of the brain, which helps get the symptoms of depression under control. The few, mild side effects that can occur are scalp irritation at the treatment site and headache, both of which can be treated with over-the-counter pain relief. If you think that you have treatment-resistant depression, talk with your doctor about whether or not TMS would work for you. What is a Brain Zap? Also known as “brain shakes”, “brain shocks” or “brain flips, a brain zap is a phenomenon that occurs as a result of decreasing the dosage or ceasing antidepressants\nWhat are the most common side effects of Antidepressants? The most common side effects of antidepressants are insomnia, blurred vision, dry mouth, fatigue, weight gain, nausea, GI distress and sexual dysfunction. What are the most common side effects of TMS? The most common side effects of TMS are scalp discomfort and headache. Can I stop taking antidepressants?

TMS stands for transcranial magnetic stimulation. It is used to treat depression by stimulating the brain non-invasively using an electromagnetic field, similar to those magnetic fields produced by an MRI machine. During TMS Therapy, a magnetic field is administered in very short pulses to the part of your brain that research has demonstrated to be associated with depression. The typical initial course of treatment is about 50 minutes daily over 4-6 weeks. The NeuroStar TMS Therapy system uses short pulses of magnetic fields to stimulate the area of the brain that is thought to function differently in patients with depression. The magnetic field produces an electric current in the brain that stimulates the brain cells (neurons). This results in changes in the brain that are thought to be beneficial in the treatment of depression. NeuroStar® is non-systemic (does not circulate in the blood throughout the body), so it does not have side effects such as weight gain, sexual dysfunction, nausea, dry mouth, sedation, among others that are commonly found with antidepressant drugs. The most common side effects reported with NeuroStar TMS during clinical trials were headache and scalp pain or discomfort – generally mild to moderate – occurring less frequently after the first week of treatment. NeuroStar TMS Therapy is cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with depression who have failed to achieve satisfactory improvement from prior antidepressant medication. * TMS Therapy may not work for all patients with depression. You should speak with your doctor to determine if TMS Therapy is an appropriate treatment option for you. No. TMS Therapy involves a unique method of using pulsed magnetic fields for therapeutic benefit. The intensity of the magnetic field is similar to that of the magnetic fields used in magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI. These techniques differ radically from the use of low intensity, static magnetic fields. These products deliver weak and undirected static fields that are not capable of activating brain cells. No, the two procedures are very different. While both are effective in the treatment of depression, there are many differences in safety and tolerability. During the TMS Therapy procedure, patients sit in a chair and are awake and alert throughout the entire 50-minute procedure – no sedation is used with TMS Therapy. Patients can transport themselves to and from treatment. In over 10,000 active treatments with NeuroStar TMS Therapy in clinical trials, no seizures were observed. TMS Therapy was also shown to have no negative effects on memory function in clinical studies. However, there is a remote risk of seizure with TMS Therapy. In contrast, “shock therapy,” or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), intentionally causes a seizure. Patients receiving ECT must be sedated with general anesthesia and paralyzed with muscle relaxants. Recovery from an ECT treatment session occurs slowly, and patients are usually closely monitored for minutes or a few hours after a treatment. Short-term confusion and memory loss are common with ECT, and long-term disruptions in memory have been shown to occur and may persist indefinitely in some people. Because of the side effects associated with ECT, a significant amount of caregiver support is required. Sarkis Family Psychiatry typically delivers NeuroStar TMS Therapy 5 times per week for 50 minute sessions over 5-6 weeks, but it varies. Your treatment may be shorter or longer.\n\nTMS can improve depression symptoms in clients with treatment-resistant depression who have not responded to other depression treatments like antidepressant medications or talk therapy. It also has far fewer side effects than antidepressant medication, which can lead to weight gain and high blood pressure. TMS for Bipolar Disorder\nTMS can be an effective treatment for symptoms of bipolar disorder as it can increase the excitability of brain activity in the target area of the brain, improving symptoms of depression. While studies have found that it may induce manic or hypomanic symptoms through stimulation, almost all bipolar disorder treatments carry this risk. TMS for Teens and Kids\nMood disorders like depression are widespread among children and teens across the world. Inadequate treatment can lead to conduct disorders, illness, poor performance at school, and a greater risk of suicide. The good news is that depression in teens is treatable and can open the doors to the future they dream of. TMS therapy can be an effective treatment for young people with depression, and the procedure's minimal side effects and accessibility make it an attractive option for young people who may want to fit TMS treatment alongside their work or studies. What Is Deep TMS Therapy? Deep TMS therapy is a form of TMS therapy that uses special combinations of coils. These coils produce electromagnetic pulses that reach below the surface of the skull, and different coils are used to reach each brain region. The FDA has approved deep TMS with the 'H1' coil for the treatment of people with treatment-resistant depression who have not responded to psychotherapy or medicine. How Much Does TMS Therapy Cost? TMS therapy can be one of the most cost-effective treatments for depression and other medical conditions. Many insurance providers cover TMS therapy under certain conditions. We accept a number of insurances as well as have payment options. To get more information contact us. We are available 24 hours a day. Is TMS Treatment the Same As Shock Therapy? Electroshock therapy (ECT) involves applying electrical currents directly to the client's head when they are sedated by anesthesia. While it can lead to short-term cognitive improvements, it is an invasive procedure that may require someone to take a break from work and home responsibilities. On the other hand, TMS therapy is non-invasive, passing electromagnetic currents through the skull. It is completely pain-free and has few side effects other than a temporary mild headache or skull discomfort. Who Should Avoid TMS Treatment? Clients who have permanent metal implants in their heads other than dental braces or fillings should not receive TMS therapy. The electromagnetic signals could cause these implants to heat up, move, or function incorrectly, risking injury or death. Implants that prevent a client from participating in TMS therapy include:\n- Deep brain stimulators\n- Aneurysm coils or clips\n- Tattoos on the face with metallic or magnetic ink\n- Electrodes that monitor brain activity\n- Any other metal medical devices or objects in or near the head\nThose considering TMS treatment should also speak with a doctor if they:\n- Take any medication\n- Have a history of seizures\n- Have a family history of epilepsy\n- Live with co-occurring mental disorders\n- Have a brain injury\n- Have had other medical conditions\n- Have previously been treated with TMS\n- Are pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant\nWhat Are the Side-Effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation? Side effects of TMS treatment are usually mild to moderate and improve soon after each session. They also tend to decrease as clients participate in sessions throughout their treatment. Common side effects may include:\n- Scalp discomfort\n- Tingling, spasms, or twitching of facial muscles\n- Lightheadedness or dizziness\nThough these side effects are mild, doctors may be able to reduce them by adjusting the intensity of the magnetic fields. There is currently not enough evidence regarding the long-term side effects of TMS treatment. Mental Wellness Treatment and Neurodiversity - TMS Therapy Near Me\nNeurodiversity refers to the difference between the parts of the brain that impact the way people socialize, learn, feel, and behave. Neurodiversity supports the view that when a brain functions differently, it is not a disability or an illness that needs to be treated. Instead, those struggling should think about adapting their social structures to accommodate their differences.\n\nA Proven Non-drug Treatment\nMagnetic energy similar to what is used in an (MRI) is used to stimulate the areas of the brain that are sluggish and causing depressed mood. Clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of NeuroStar® TMS Therapy in treating patients who have not benefited from prior antidepressant medication. NeuroStar TMS Therapy was studied in adult patients suffering from Major Depressive Disorder, all of whom had not received satisfactory improvement with previous treatments. TMS stands for transcranial magnetic stimulation. It is used to treat depression by stimulating the brain non-invasively using electromagnetic fields, similar to those produced by an MRI machine. During TMS Therapy, a magnetic field is administered in very short pulses to the part of the brain that research has demonstrated to be associated with depression. The typical initial course of treatment is about 19-37 minutes daily over 4-6 weeks. The NeuroStar TMS Therapy system uses short pulses of magnetic fields to stimulate the area of the brain that is thought to function abnormally in patients with depression. The magnetic field produces an electric current in the brain that stimulates the brain cells (neurons). This results in changes that are thought to be beneficial in the treatment of depression. It usually takes time for healthcare insurers to establish coverage policies for newly approved treatments such as NeuroStar TMS. However, many commercial and Medicare plans have recognized the effectiveness of treating depression with TMS Therapy and now cover TMS as part of their plans. See here for a full list of insurance plans that cover TMS. NeuroStar® is non-systemic (does not circulate in the blood throughout the body), so it does not have side effects such as weight gain, sexual dysfunction, nausea, dry mouth, sedation, etc. The most common side effects reported during clinical trials were headache and scalp discomfort – generally mild to moderate – occurring less frequently after the first week of treatment. No. TMS Therapy involves a unique method of using pulsed magnetic fields for therapeutic benefit. The intensity of the magnetic field is similar to that of the magnetic fields used in magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI. These techniques differ radically from the popular use of low intensity, static magnetic fields. These products deliver weak and undirected static fields that are not capable of activating brain cells.\n\nWhile TMS Therapy has shown to be effective, not all patients will benefit from it. Patients should be carefully monitored for worsening symptoms, signs or symptoms of suicidal behavior, and\/or unusual behavior. Families and caregivers should also be aware of the need to observe patients and notify their treatment provider if symptoms worsen. Typically, the average course of TMS Therapy happens five times per week for exactly 37 minutes sessions over a 4-6 week timeframe. Any additional treatments are based on clinical judgment. No. While both show effective results for treating depression, there are many differences in safety and tolerability. During a TMS treatment session, patients are sitting, awake and alert throughout the entire 37-minute procedure. This means that no sedation is required for TMS Therapy. Patients are able to transport themselves to and from their treatment. In contrast, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), commonly referred to as “shock therapy,” is meant to intentionally causes a seizure. Patients who receive ECT are sedated with general anesthesia and paralyzed with muscle relaxants. After the treatment, recovery occurs slowly, and patients are typically monitored under close supervision for minutes or a even few hours after a treatment. Patients often experience short-term confusion and memory loss after a ECT session. Even long-term memory disruptions have been reported and may persist indefinitely in some people. Significant caregiver supervision is often required after treatment, due to the side effects commonly associated with ECT. TMS is non-systemic, which means that it does not circulate in the blood throughout the body. Because it’s non-systemic, it does not have typical anti-depression medication side effects such as weight gain, sexual dysfunction, nausea, dry mouth, sedation, etc. The most common side effects reported during clinical trials were mild to moderate headache and scalp discomfort. Side effects typically occur less frequently after the first week of treatment. Yes! Transcranial magnetic stimulation is typically covered by most insurances.

TMS stands for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. It uses magnetic fields to induce a current in specific brain areas and thus stimulate or suppress brain activity. Using TMS allows doctors to change brain activity without surgery and with minimal discomfort to the patient. TMS has been used to treat a variety of disorders including migraines, stroke, Parkinson's disease and depression. Who is a good candidate for TMS for depression? In 2009, the Food and Drug Administration approved the NeuroStar TMS Therapy system for treatment of people with major depressive disorder who haven't seen satisfactory improvement from medication. As with any treatment option, you and your doctor should discuss if TMS therapy is right for you. What are the sessions like and how many are needed? During each TMS session, patients sit comfortably in a chair. The stimulation coil (wand) is held just above the head, targeting magnetic pulses to a 2-3 centimeter area of a specific area of the brain. The nature of the magnetic fields allows them to pass through the patient's hair, skin and skull and into the mood-regulating area without being distorted in any way. Patients do not require anesthesia or sedation. In the brain, these magnetic pulses produce small electrical currents. The electricity created in the brain cannot be felt by the patient, but is sufficient to change the activity of brain cells. Applied repeatedly, these magnetic pulses modify the activity of the targeted brain area and can thus help the brain overcome the dysfunction associated with depression. Treatments last for about 40 minutes and occur every day for a period of several weeks. Is it safe? TMS is a safe treatment for depression if appropriate guidelines are followed. In more than 10,000 treatments administered in clinical studies, the most common side effect was mild-to-moderate scalp pain or discomfort at the treatment area, which declined \"markedly after the first week.\" Fewer than 5 percent of patients stopped treatment due to adverse effects. There is a very small risk of seizure - about the same risk as when taking medications to treat depression. Does it work? In clinical studies involving hundreds of people with major depressive disorder, significant improvement was recorded for symptoms of core depression, anxiety, and other forms of psychological distress. In most patients, benefits lasted through the 6-month study follow-up period. While NeuroStar TMS Therapy has been proven effective, not all patients will benefit. Patients should be carefully monitored for worsening symptoms. Will my insurance cover it? While the treatment was recently FDA approved, not all insurance companies yet cover the treatments. Our staff will assist you in contacting your insurance company about coverage. Where do I call for more information?

However, when these feelings pervade one’s thoughts and it becomes impossible to function normally, further evaluation and consideration is necessary. Anxiety and depression are both common in our society, though it is reported that only a third of sufferers receive treatment for their condition. There are numerous disorders under the large umbrella of anxiety and depression, and it believed that the cause of symptoms are multi factorial and include biological, genetic, environmental and psychological factors. While most seek treatment with cognitive therapy and oral medications, some people are refractory to these treatments and require help with other modalities. Since the 1940s and 1950s, Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) has been used for the treatment of depression and mania. ECT works by administering general anesthesia to the patient and using an electric current that causes a brief seizure. While ECT can help with severe depression and suicidal thoughts, potential side effects include adverse reaction to the anesthesia, memory loss and confusion. Since 2008, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been used approved by the FDA for treatment of depression. During a TMS procedure, a magnetic field generator is placed against the scalp of a patient. Electric currents stimulate nerve cells involved in mood control and depression. Unlike ECT, patients are awake and alert during procedures and can be completed in an office setting. With TMS, the risk of general anesthesia is alleviated. In addition, the main reported side effect is headache, as compared to the side effects of anesthesia and possible amnesia. Here, at the Center for Natural and Integrative Medicine, we have practitioners certified in the administration of TMS. If you are experiencing ongoing symptoms of depression and have failed other therapeutic options, TMS may be a choice for you. It may be an important step in your path to healing.","passages":[{"passage":"Side effects and medication option for TMS\nDepression is one of the leading causes of disability in the US among the people between 15-44 years of age. Mental health conditions and depression are confusing and overwhelming, but the good news is that the relief is now possible as there are more advanced treatment options available than ever before to help you live a healthy life. Depression generally leads to isolation from the friends and family, and an only medical professional can provide the necessary help. Most often, medication and talk therapy help decrease depression, but those with major depressive disorder or treatment-resistant depression need to try multiple medications or advanced therapies like TMS. TMS is a non-invasive and drug-free therapy prescribed for patients who suffer from MDD and don’t respond well to medication. TMS delivers electromagnetic pulses to the pre-frontal cortex that regulates mood and stimulate cortical neurons to relieve the depression symptoms. Approximately 50-60% of people suffering from depression who have tried and failed to benefit from medications, witness full remission with TMS. In 2008, FDA cleared TMS for treating depression, and it is administered in sessions that generally last for 30-40 minutes, five times a week over 4-6 weeks. No sedation or anesthesia is given to the patients; therefore, they can resume their usual activities right after their session. Repeated treatment encourages the formation of new circuits providing relief to the patients. Unlike depression medications, TMS is not associated with systemic side effects that are caused by the passage of drugs through the bloodstream. Only reported side effect of TMS is mild-to-moderate discomfort caused by the electromagnetic pulses. Some of the common side effects include:\n2. Spasms, tingling, and twitching of the facial muscles\n3. Discomfort in the scalp at the site of stimulation\nYou can ask the doctor to adjust the stimulation level to reduce the symptoms if you experience painful scalp sensation or facial twitching. Or can take over-the-counter pain medication and tend to lessen over the course of treatmen1t. There is minimal risk of seizure. To ensure that you are eligible for TMS a physical examination and psychiatric evolution to discuss depression is done. The evaluation helps you make sure that TMS is safe and a good option. TMS is not safe in the following conditions:\nYou are pregnant or planning to get pregnant\nThere is an implanted medical device in the body\nYou have a history of seizures\nThere is brain damage from past injury or illness\nYou suffer from frequent headaches\nTo ensure you get the best treatment, it is suggested to look for a well-reputed clinic. Getting the treatment from experienced practitioners and healthcare providers will ensure exceptional comfort and minimum side effects. Before you start the therapy, make an appointment and see if you are comfortable with them, and you feel calm at the clinic. Also, check whether the clinic accepts health insurance as most health insurance companies these days cover TMS treatment.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:006fbb26-e254-4535-8f97-45999dcce05e>"]},{"passage":"A therapist helps patients identify their triggers and develop healthy coping mechanisms to prevent future episodes. How does TMS help alleviate depression? TMS uses non-invasive electromagnetic energy to stimulate the brain. Research on TMS and depression have found that the electromagnetic pulses, when applied to depressed areas of the brain, activates neurons thought to be responsible for depression symptoms. Why would someone choose TMS Along with medication? Medications are often the first line of defense in treating depression. Most patients will respond favorably to antidepressants. However, sometimes people need additional help. TMS can help those who are experiencing treatment-resistant depression. Also, medications can come with a range of side effects and other issues. Some of the most common side effects of antidepressants are weight gain, stomach upset, dry mouth, drowsiness, and sexual dysfunction. When receiving TMS, it’s important to also work with your mental healthcare professional on finding the right medications for you.

TMS: TREAT YOUR DEPRESSION WITHOUT BRAIN ZAPS, WITHOUT MEDICATION\nMany people give up on their depression treatment if they experience side effects or they feel as though their current treatment isn’t working. Giving up on treatment can leave you feeling discouraged and hopeless. It can be demoralizing when the symptoms return after stopping the medication. It can also be dangerous, in the case of discontinuation syndrome, to unilaterally decide to stop treatment. If you have experienced side effects like brain shakes or brain zaps after stopping antidepressants or the symptoms have returned, don’t give up on treatment. It is possible to treat your depressionwithout brain zaps, without medication. Many people do get their depression under control with the right treatment. A non-invasive, no medication alternative to antidepressants is transcranial magnetic stimulation. TMS is a non-invasive treatment for people dealing with depression. Numerousresearch studies have been conducted to proveits effectiveness, and it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2008 for severe depression. It is also a good alternative for people who have not found relief from antidepressants due to their preponderance of systemic effects. Transcranial magnetic stimulation uses magnets to stimulate a specific area of the brain that is related to depression. TMS promotes new brain cell activity in this area of the brain, which helps get the symptoms of depression under control. The few, mild side effects that can occur are scalp irritation at the treatment site and headache, both of which can be treated with over-the-counter pain relief. If you think that you have treatment-resistant depression, talk with your doctor about whether or not TMS would work for you. What is a Brain Zap? Also known as “brain shakes”, “brain shocks” or “brain flips, a brain zap is a phenomenon that occurs as a result of decreasing the dosage or ceasing antidepressants\nWhat are the most common side effects of Antidepressants?

As with any treatment option, you and your doctor should discuss if TMS therapy is right for you. What are the sessions like and how many are needed? During each TMS session, patients sit comfortably in a chair. The stimulation coil (wand) is held just above the head, targeting magnetic pulses to a 2-3 centimeter area of a specific area of the brain. The nature of the magnetic fields allows them to pass through the patient's hair, skin and skull and into the mood-regulating area without being distorted in any way. Patients do not require anesthesia or sedation. In the brain, these magnetic pulses produce small electrical currents. The electricity created in the brain cannot be felt by the patient, but is sufficient to change the activity of brain cells. Applied repeatedly, these magnetic pulses modify the activity of the targeted brain area and can thus help the brain overcome the dysfunction associated with depression. Treatments last for about 40 minutes and occur every day for a period of several weeks. Is it safe? TMS is a safe treatment for depression if appropriate guidelines are followed. In more than 10,000 treatments administered in clinical studies, the most common side effect was mild-to-moderate scalp pain or discomfort at the treatment area, which declined \"markedly after the first week.\" Fewer than 5 percent of patients stopped treatment due to adverse effects. There is a very small risk of seizure - about the same risk as when taking medications to treat depression. Does it work? In clinical studies involving hundreds of people with major depressive disorder, significant improvement was recorded for symptoms of core depression, anxiety, and other forms of psychological distress. In most patients, benefits lasted through the 6-month study follow-up period. While NeuroStar TMS Therapy has been proven effective, not all patients will benefit. Patients should be carefully monitored for worsening symptoms. Will my insurance cover it? While the treatment was recently FDA approved, not all insurance companies yet cover the treatments. Our staff will assist you in contacting your insurance company about coverage. Where do I call for more information?

However, when these feelings pervade one’s thoughts and it becomes impossible to function normally, further evaluation and consideration is necessary. Anxiety and depression are both common in our society, though it is reported that only a third of sufferers receive treatment for their condition. There are numerous disorders under the large umbrella of anxiety and depression, and it believed that the cause of symptoms are multi factorial and include biological, genetic, environmental and psychological factors. While most seek treatment with cognitive therapy and oral medications, some people are refractory to these treatments and require help with other modalities. Since the 1940s and 1950s, Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) has been used for the treatment of depression and mania. ECT works by administering general anesthesia to the patient and using an electric current that causes a brief seizure. While ECT can help with severe depression and suicidal thoughts, potential side effects include adverse reaction to the anesthesia, memory loss and confusion. Since 2008, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been used approved by the FDA for treatment of depression. During a TMS procedure, a magnetic field generator is placed against the scalp of a patient. Electric currents stimulate nerve cells involved in mood control and depression. Unlike ECT, patients are awake and alert during procedures and can be completed in an office setting. With TMS, the risk of general anesthesia is alleviated. In addition, the main reported side effect is headache, as compared to the side effects of anesthesia and possible amnesia. Here, at the Center for Natural and Integrative Medicine, we have practitioners certified in the administration of TMS. If you are experiencing ongoing symptoms of depression and have failed other therapeutic options, TMS may be a choice for you. It may be an important step in your path to healing.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e4fe4600-22ba-48ac-8be0-5dcf5908cadc>"]}]}

Cole ruffled a few purple hairs with the finale track of his newly released KOD album, 1985 (Intro to ‘The Fall Off’). Some clumsily labeled the record a “diss” track at the millennial rap generation, namely Lil Pump: the 17-year-old Miami rapper who dropped an unprovoked “F**k J. Cole” diss song. But it’s actually a page from Cole’s 33-year-old book of wisdom that he was generous enough to share with the emerging rap generation beneath him without needing to resort to a “diss” record. However, according to Coke Boys founder French Montana, “every generation of hip-hop” is to be respected. The South Bronx native spoke with LA Weekly after a question about hip-hop enthusiasts who “hate” on Lil Pump. French said that he loves what the rapper is doing for the rap game, though it isn’t clear what that specifically is. “I love what Tupac and Biggie did for the game, I also love what Run-DMC and them did for the game,” he continued. “I just feel like the game just changes.” The “Unforgettable” rapper championed the financially elevated lifestyle rap has afforded artists in this day and age as it “just shows growth.” Without name-dropping anyone, French believes that anyone who doesn’t like Pump shouldn’t listen to him, anyway, especially since there are still lyrical artists existing in the current state of rap. “Whatever kind of rap you want to listen to, go listen to it,” he said. “I love Lil Pump’s music.” As aforementioned, French doesn't specifically name anyone, but also doesn’t speak much to Pump’s shots at Cole which—if anyone could take a wild guess—might presumably stem from not appreciating or liking the Dreamville leader as a “lyrical” artist. He’ll be happy to know he has at least one friend and fan in French. See the purple-haired rapper’s new attempt at Cole’s attention in the video below.

They bring these people in and give them job functions that had been covered by multiple people in the past. It makes it hard to know what to expect from the records. What sort of impact do you think this has had on music itself? There’s no lack of interesting and good music coming out, it’s just the way the system works now. I’d like to have the comfort of thinking that everything that has happened to me hasn’t been luck; it’s been me making good decisions. When I don’t understand what’s going on, I just try to sit and watch. It’s about trying to fit into the scheme of where things are going in the future. I’m an artist that wrote about the harsh realities and that’s always what’s translated the strongest about my music. In film thusfar, I’ve only taken on characters that embodied the same mannerisms or attitudes. I’m trying to broaden peoples' perception of me, so that when they see me they don’t pigeonhole me as being only able to do one thing. Does the evolving industry make it more difficult for you to make music or does it have no impact whatsoever? It’s hard if you’re not in a position where the machine is behind you non-stop. I’m lucky to be an artist that doesn’t have to look for press. If I say anything controversial in this interview, they’ll take this and run it on all the blogs. What do you think about the evolution of hip-hop from gangsta archetypes to skinny jean-wearing hyper-emotional types? It’s missing what I fell in love with about hip-hop culture. There’s almost no one creating or making the type of hip-hop that I grew up on. I’m a huge Ice Cube fan — I still watch Cube like I’ve never sold a record. I still watch his interviews and study him. He came from the position where his music reflected the aggressions and harsh realities of life, and now he’s highly respected on a broader scope. You can see a television show based on a movie he made. It’s interesting to watch someone's personal choices and how they impact their career. Dre is different from me — his relationship with Jimmy Iovine will allow him to stay relevant regardless of what he does. He can stay home for another 10 years and then put out a record and it will get tons of promotion... He’ll always be a priority. Whatever happened with the Rick Ross feud? Did you ever talk to him and clear the air? I never had a conversation with him. My focus shifted during that record. A lot of times, earlier in my career, I was competing with artists because that was what I loved about hip-hop: The idea that battling someone was necessary to defend your spot and you had to take on all challengers — so I did that constantly. No one thinks that way now and everyone looks at me like I’m the Broad Street Bully. The younger kids coming up missed that time frame, and even the conscious rap is gone, too. The stuff that Common Sense and Talib Kweli and Mos Def were rhyming about. What was socially conscious and responsible about the music has been replaced by hipster kids in skinny jeans and mohawks. Of course, that’s always been around, but it was usually confined to the Village. Artists have always had the opportunity to influence the culture, but now it’s the other way around: They’re trying to look like their audience to attract their audience. Now you can’t tell the difference between a Led Zeppelin fan and a hip-hop fan. Do you think this is just part of a natural ebb and flow of cultural change? It’s a cyclical shift. It’s like fashion, everything is recycled and comes back. I’m really excited by it. Sometimes, it’s best to just take a look at what’s going on and observe. On my first album, I was writing to one concept. With “Black Magic,” I wrote a bunch of material, but now I have time to spend on what I have to offer. I think it should be my best work.\n\nSomething like \"Cruise\" really does show how similar music from different parts of the country really can be. I think the way that kids grow up now, that with social media they get it all at once. Like, the coolest table in the cafeteria is probably the most mixed table of all. It's got the coolest black kids, it's got the coolest white kids, it's got the coolest Asian kids, it's got the coolest girls, the coolest guys, the jocks, the coolest nerd, you see what I'm saying? It's the mixture. Even with Florida Georgia Line, they're some pretty young guys they're like 27, you look at Nelly, this is my 16th year so those guys [knew me] since they were freakin' 11, I hate to say that shit [Laughs.] They've been influenced by myself and things of that nature, so when they come to the music they have no choice but to put some of the influence of what they've been listening to. Well this year marks the 15th anniversary of Country Grammar. What did you do differently on that record, compared to how you make records now? Man, it's a great saying, \"You have a lifetime to make your first record, you got a year to make every one after that.\" That's basically it. When you're talking about Country Grammar, man, we were waiting since I started rapping to make that album. How was it different technically? It's a difference in the sound. I was kinda the only one doing what I was doing, now the whole fucking game is singing. [Laughs.] The whole game is melodic now, and I was the only one doing it. You know? I was the first one to sing his own hook, rap his own verses and sing his own bridge. And continuously doing that because my influences, such as Bone Thugs, Goodie Mob, Cee-Lo Green and Arrested Development, you're listening to 'em and trying to find your own niche and then when you come with it but you come with it in a way that's so surprising to people. People don't understand that, shit, the whole game is doing Nelly. Do you get rappers saying, \"Thanks for hooking this up. Thanks for making this happen?\" Nah man, it's all good. Obviously, when you meet other artists, other artists definitely show their appreciation. . . . It's kind of hard to find someone that sings and raps that wasn't a Nelly fan. And it's a little easier to do it now because of Auto-Tune. I didn't have Auto-Tune. That was straight my notes. I had to work that shit out. I had to actually hit notes. Are you anti-Auto-Tune? No, no, no. I'm not anti-anything. It's just used so much now, it just sounds like the norm. That's why I say I'm not \"anti.\" One thing I know and I understand is evolution. Everything must change. . . . Hip-hop was created by the youth for the youth. So, you got to let the youth take it where they're gonna take it. If you want to be involved, be involved. If you don't, you don't. It's getting to a point now where hip-hop has a history. Older people, when I was younger, they didn't have hip-hop. If they didn't like it, they just listened to whatever they wanted to do. Now I'm a parent. I had hip-hop, so I don't have to listen to their hip hop. I can listen to my hip-hop. But we're still listening to hip-hop. Listen, I could be 65 years old, if Jay-Z's having a concert, I'm there. We're in a different era now. I'm not gonna never stop wearing Jordans. I mean unless another company gives me a hellafied check to stop wearing 'em. I don't care if I'm 80, I'mma put on some sneakers. And it's just one of those things that back in the day, it was a certain way you had to dress if you were older. \"Why do you have that baseball cap on? C'mon, you're a 50 year-old man. Why do you have on a ball cap and sneakers?\" Now, shit, it doesn't matter.\n\n“What we’re gonna do right here is go back, way back, back into time.”\n— Troglodite, by the Jimmy Castor Bunch\nHip-Hop has always been hyper-conscious about its roots, maybe because it began with young people playing, and then rapping over, older music. Hip-hop artists of all stripes are constantly sampling, referencing, and quoting artists from the past, creatively reconstructing their family trees. Every once in a while, an emcee takes this to the next level. They become lyrical historians, narrating the evolution of hip-hop and its art forms. I’ve always been a sucker for this genre of song, ever since I was a kid in the Boston suburbs scanning the radio dial intently to learn everything I could about this incredible sound coming from the nation’s urban centers. In this post, I share twelve songs about hip-hop history, some famous and some lesser known. Unless you’re extremely well-informed, it’ll probably take some additional research to get all the references (Rap Genius can help, http:\/\/rap.genius.com\/). For teachers, these songs could come in handy as prompts for classroom discussions. For example, conversations about what these songs include, and what they leave out, could be extremely informative. These songs don’t really tell the whole story. They are pretty US-heavy and overly-nostalgic, and there are plenty of gaps. For one, I couldn’t find any written by women (if you know any, please comment!). Still, if you’re looking to dive into hip-hop’s roots, here are some guides to lead you. 1. South Bronx, by Boogie Down Productions\nIt’s generally agreed that hip-hop as we know it today first emerged in the South Bronx, so there’s no better song to start with than South Bronx, by KRS-One and Scott LaRock. This song was written in response to MC Shan and DJ Marley Marl’s, The Bridge, which claimed Queens, NY, as hip-hop’s birthplace. It’s clear today who won this argument. 2. Knowledge is Power, by Akala\nOf course, hip-hop didn’t appear in the South Bronx out of nowhere. It’s roots lie deep in African, African-American, Afro-Caribbean, and Latin American musical and oral traditions. In Knowledge is Power, UK-based emcee Akala calls the Bronx-based origin story a “myth,” and argues that those who love hip-hop need to look much deeper into its antecedents. 3. Lune Tns, by Company Flow\nToday the emcee has become the preeminent image of the hip-hop artist. But, of course, rapping is only one of the hip-hop elements. In Lune Tns, Bigg Jus of Company Flow pays homage to the great and lesser known graffiti artists of New York City. 4. Gangsta Rap, by Ice T\nHip-hop may have originally coalesced in New York, but it quickly spread. In Gangsta Rap, Ice T recounts how hip-hop was picked up by artists on the West Coast. There, hip-hop and local gang culture converged to birth West coast gangsta rap, which then took the world by storm (for good and ill). 5. Latinos Stand Up (Remix), by Chino XL, Sick Jacken, Thirstin Howl, B Real, Sinful, and Kid Frost\nLatinos artists have been part of hip-hop’s evolution since its birth, but have often been unrecognized for their contributions. In this song, some of the most well-known Latino rappers join together to represent for the Latin hip-hop tradition. 6. Underground Heaven, by Cesar Comanche\nUnderground Heaven highlights the central role of the DJ\/Producer in creating the sound we recognize today as hip-hop music. It’s something of an ode to the independent record store and the sample, and has a great verse that rolls through some of the most classic samples in hip-hop. 7. I Used To Love H.E.R., by Common\nIn this famous song, Common narrates the evolution of hip-hop metaphorically, personifying hip-hop as a woman with whom he has a sort of on-again, off-again relationship.\n\nand MTV's Sway Calloway provides: \"The detail that manufactured that period so wonderful is that absolutely nothing was contrived. Every thing was even now becoming discovered and anything was however revolutionary and new\". [one zero five] Author William Jelani Cobb suggests \"what produced the era they inaugurated deserving of your expression golden was the sheer quantity of stylistic improvements that arrived into existence. The 2008 Broadway production fused salsa and hip hop types, and involved rap. Miranda introduced hip hop to Richard Rogers Theater a second time in 2015 with his creation Hamilton. The demonstrate had box Business success. Hamilton and Within the Heights bundled rap as well as the cast recording of Hamilton created a number 1 album on the Billboard rap charts. The success of Hamilton reveals that hip hop might have a vital job in musical theater. [a hundred and seventy] Innovation and revitalization\nIn late 1979, Debbie Harry of Blondie took Nile Rodgers of Stylish to these types of an occasion, as the most crucial backing monitor made use of was the split from Stylish's \"Very good Situations\". The new model motivated Harry, and Blondie's afterwards hit one from 1981 \"Rapture\" became the 1st key single containing hip hop factors by a white team or artist to strike primary over the U. ..they have accomplished movies about nurse killers and Trainer killers and pupil killers. [Actor] Arnold Schwarzenegger blew away dozens of cops because the Terminator. But I do not hear anybody complaining about that.\" In exactly the same interview, Ice-T instructed to Philips which the misunderstanding of Cop Killer plus the tries to censor it experienced racial overtones: \"The Supreme Court suggests It really is OK to get a white male to melt away a cross in community. But nobody would like a black man to write a file about a cop killer.\" Occasional data—such as Grandmaster Flash's \"The Message\" in 1982 and Operate-DMC's \"It is Like That\" in 1984—received vital approval, but rap, typically, was dismissed being a passing fancy—far too repetitious, way too 1 dimensional. Still rap did not disappear, and an explosion of Strength and creativeness within the late eighties leaves rap these days as arguably the most very important new street-oriented audio in pop since the start of rock inside the fifties. Lots of individuals are unaware that Perry Ellis aided launch the streetwear scene with its typical Perry Ellis The usa sub-line that premiered back again in 1984, but now It really is back again to point out us how the OGs are having points... Examine Post\nHip hop as both a musical genre along with a tradition was shaped in the course of the seventies when block functions grew to become ever more preferred in Ny city, significantly among African-American youth residing in the Bronx. Nevertheless hip-hop music did not get officially recorded for the radio or television to play till 1979, largely on account of poverty for the duration of hip-hop's start and not enough acceptance outside ghetto neighborhoods. At block events DJs played percussive breaks of well-liked tunes utilizing two turntables as well as a DJ mixer to be able to Enjoy breaks from two copies of a similar history, alternating from one to another and lengthening the \"split\". [sixteen] Hip hop's early evolution happened as sampling technologies and drum devices turned extensively offered and affordable. Turntablist strategies for example scratching and beatmatching formulated combined Ateo Feo with the breaks and Jamaican toasting, a chanting vocal type, was applied over the beats. In Tanzania inside the early 2000s, community hip hop artists became well-known by infusing regional models of Afrobeat and arabesque melodies, dancehall and hip-hop beats with Swahili lyrics. Rap linguistics\nHip hop as music and tradition fashioned in the course of the 1970s in Ny city in the multicultural Trade in between African-American youth from America and young immigrants and youngsters of immigrants from nations during the Caribbean. Hip hop music in its infancy is called an outlet plus a voice for the disenfranchised youth of marginalized backgrounds and lower-income regions, as the hip hop lifestyle mirrored the social, economic and political realities in their lives.\n\n[Criminologists Kevin] Steinmetz and [Howard] Henderson concluded that the main law enforcement-related themes in hip-hop are not pleasure and pride in aggressive and criminal acts, but the unfairness of the criminal justice system and the powerlessness felt by those targeted by it. Lyrics about law enforcement, for example, frequently portrayed cops as predators exercising an illegitimate power. Imprisonment, likewise, was blamed for weakening familial and community relationships and described a modern method of oppression. The study’s authors concluded that “the overwhelming message in hip-hop wasn’t that the rappers disliked the idea of justice, but they disliked the way it was being implemented.” More insights from the authors via Meredith Mohr:\n“[T]he music is maturing, evolving,” Henderson said. “Take Jay-Z for example. If you look at his lyrical content from 1990-2012, you see the evolution from talking about drug selling at the beginning of his career to now talking about meeting with the president, helping with the campaign. It’s a very different conversation. We never saw an artist go backwards. You only saw them mature as they age, and experience and their music changes with them.”\nPart of this, Henderson said, is because the audience has also changed with the artists. “Jay-Z’s listenership has aged with him,” Henderson said. “Part of it is that artists recognize that if they go back and talk about that very animalistic behavior, their listeners are going to say, ‘hey listen, this is not what I want to hear,’ and they’re going to go somewhere else.\n\nspawned a new breed of rapper, styled as gun-toting hoodlum supposedly giving suburban America a frightening peek into ghetto life the group knew from pretty early on that about 80 percent of the people buying their albums were white, middle-class kids. Although the industry was happy to cash in, pressure by conservative advocacy groups on major corporations such as Time Warner (parent company of TIME.com) resulted in the industry backing away from promoting gangsta rap. \"Hip-Hop Nation\" includes original correspondence detailing efforts by Ice-T to be released from his Warner Brothers contract after the corporation had sought to curb certain lyrics. Gangsta rap, with its narrative tales and its cinematic funk-driven sound, offered a distinct alternative to the tricky bebop gymnastics of the freestyling East Coast. But hip-hop came close to destroying itself in the mid-'90s when that bicoastal rivalry almost turned into a shooting war, as Tupac Shakur between surviving shootings and spells in prison threatened the life of Brooklyn rapper the Notorious B.I.G. and both men, former friends, were by the end of 1997 dead in as-yet-unsolved drive-by shootings. But while most hip-hop fans today may be well versed in the tale of Tupac and Biggie, the show transports them back to an era they may find hard to imagine. After all, the almost pharaonic fantasy world of a Puffy Combs video is light-years away from the hand-stenciled mimeographs with crude sketches advertising an around-the-way appearance of Kurtis Blow or a block party featuring Grandmaster Flash. This was a do-it yourself movement in the outer boroughs, a culture being built by hand, brick by brick one to which the suits running the music industry in the glass towers across the river were mostly impervious for more than a decade. And for kids grown accustomed to hip-hop as the bearer of grim tales of death and destruction, \"Hip-Hop Nation\" offers a glimpse of a reminder that the cultural roots were in joyous block parties and people having getting together to have a good time no matter how grim their circumstances. That much is summed up in the words of one pioneering DJ carried in a video installation: \"If there was negativity and fights breaking out at your party, that means your DJ was whack.\" IT WAS AT THOSE PARTIES in the \"Boogie Down\" South Bronx where hip-hop's founding fathers Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaata and Grandmaster Flash first began delivering spoken rhymes over the break beats on funk and disco records sometime in the mid-'70s. Today the signature beats-and-rhymes combination of the musical art form they created is as ubiquitous in America's tony suburbs as in its forgotten housing projects, and has kids in distant parts of the world whose first language may be French or Japanese or Wolof chanting choruses inviting their friends to \"get at me, dawg.\" Hip-hop's language not simply its slang, which is as likely to be heard in Yale dorm rooms as on inner-city street corners, but its idiom, which involves combining the spoken (or screamed) word with a pastiche of musical elements drawn from previous songs and styles reassembled in new and unique combinations is not only the preeminent musical genre of a generation, it's also a complex, ever-evolving organism that has spawned countless dialects that are constantly in conversation with one another. HIP-HOP CULTURE may be difficult to define, but it is pervasive nonetheless. It began simply as a combination of four art forms deejaying, rapping, break dancing and graffiti tagging but it quickly evolved into a cultural revolution in which young African-Americans literally remade their America. In the spirit of Malcolm X and the Black Panthers, they didn't simply demand to be admitted as an equal in Whitey's world; they created their own popular culture grounded in the lived reality and aspirations of black life in America. Far from demanding to join the club, the hip-hop kids created their own. And once they'd built it, Whitey came, desperately seeking access to the \"cool\" that, as Norman Mailer famously noted, has in postwar urban America been inexorably associated with blackness.\n\nIt’s still things that’s relevant to this time period, but I just wanted “in your face” lyrics, real hard, soulful; just a big kaleidoscope of music, a little bit of everything, somethin’ for everybody. GW: Do you feel a lot of rappers in the game are doing music as a side job? Quest: I wouldn’t even say that. The way hip-hop is to the younger people is that it’s really no talent involved. A lot of people think they can just jump on the microphone, go, “yayayaya…” on beat and it sound good. That’s not really what it is, you know what I’m sayin? Back in the day, you couldn’t just get on the mic and rap. Right now, it’s easy to get $500 together, get a audio interface, a microphone, some beats on SoundClick, and call yourself a rapper. I think that’s a little too easy. If I get a chance, I at least try to school some of the younger, upcoming rappers. Try to incorporate some lyrics. Learn a lil’ bit about what’s goin’ on in hip-hop before you just jump into a song. People think rap is easy and it’s really not if you do it right. We’re just makin’ hip-hop wack. If the average listener listens to somebody who’s a local and they promotin’ their mixtape, or whatever, and it’s corny, they’re not gonna take the chance to listen to nobody else. Music is so quick and disposable now, you got even mainstream artists doin’ two or three mixtapes a year now. They would put out an album every two or three years. GW: On “Dat Knock,” you address a female. Are you drawn to a female’s intellect before her body or what covers it? Quest: For females walkin’ around with a Gucci bag, Prada shoes, a Gucci hat, whatever, that’s not gon’ define who she is when that’s not on her. Have a conversation, your shoes, hat, and purse is not gon’ talk to you. That’s cool for the time bein’, I’m with somebody now, but if I’m with somebody, they have to have some type of conversation. Once you get out the club, you gotta talk. I want to know where you at. God forbid, we in a situation, I need you to be on point. I need you to be intelligent enough to make a rational decision. Who wouldn’t want a woman who doesn’t do that? GW: Is the rap game a dream, like the title of your track, “The Dream?”\nQuest: One of my theories is, rap is gonna become fly fishin’. You know how people in the ‘90s just go fly fishin’? It’s gonna be like that with hip-hop, where people are just old, they still love hip-hop, still make hip-hop, and still have love and a drive for hip-hop. If I wanna make beats at 60, I’m gonna make a beat. Just like when you go to the basketball court, it be like 50, 60-year-old dudes out there say, “I got next.” If you still successful within yourself, takin’ care of business, I say do what you wanna do. GW: Do you always do what you want to do with your music or do you compromise with other artists? Quest: I have to compromise when it comes to production jobs. As long as I don’t do anything too crazy, off the wall, nobody will say anything to me. They [managers and JSL] kinda trust my judgment when I’m makin’ music. I try not to say, “I’ma do this ‘cause such and such is doin’ this.” I’ma do what comes from my heart and soul when it comes to music. I ain’t gon’ try to force feed you anything. GW: You have a song called, “UShudaKnown.” What’s something you feel everyone should know? Quest: We had a conversation in the studio about Illuminati. Illuminati is the big thing in hip-hop and I think that’s pretty lame. There’s things that need a little more time and devotion than Illuminati. I think people are lookin’ too deep into things and not realizing that it’s music. This is just a term brought up now to have somethin’ to talk about, targetin’ hip-hop.\n\nI think I got it locked, just smooth while I latch it\nQ-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest, Steve Biko\nMy pen taps the paper and my brain's blank\nNas, Memory Lane\nI'm voices in your subconscious, knots in your intestines\nCrescent moon attack stance if you glance at the mic\n-Casual from Hieroglyphics, Dune Methane\nI'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells\nNow come aboard, it's Medina bound\nEnter the chamber, and it's a whole different sound\nIt's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel\nSo deep it's picked up on radios in tunnels\nGZA from the Wu-Tang Clan, Liquid Swords\nAnd, of course, some words from the master:\nWait by the radio hand on the dial soon\nAs you hear it, pump up the volume\nDance with the speaker til you hear it blow\nThen plug in your headphone because there it go\nAnd, most tellingly:\nI am the R, to the A to the KIM\nIf I wasn't, why would I say I am? Rakim, Pump up the Volume and As the Rhyme Goes On. Please excuse me for starting this with so many quotes, but once I start quoting great hip-hop songs, it is hard for me to stop. I also wanted to introduce this without introduction, showing hip-hop as it is without discussing the political and social viewpoints and misviewpoints first. I first started listening to hip-hop when I bought a Public Enemy tape in 1994, and I immediately responded to the message. For me, Public Enemy wasn't that much different from Neil Young, both were putting righteous anger to music. But I liked the sound itself, and soon enough, I started branching out into other hip-hop acts, but mostly ones with some sort of message, even if it was the more subtle messages of say, De La Soul. Substance was important for me. The fact that half of rap consisted of bragging seemed to be a necessary evil. Some of those songs and lyrics inspired me, but I always associated them somehow with something else, perhaps as an extension of the messages I heard in other lyrics. If you ask hip-hop fans how they got started, and you will hear many different stories, but this one isn't uncommon. For middle class kids, social consciousness is often the reason to start listening to hip-hop. There is currently about twenty years of debate and warfare in hip-hop about what constitutes hip-hop, with the authenticity of various viewpoints challenged. Many socially conscious rappers and fans feel that rap with criminal themes is a marketing plot to sell fantasies to suburbanites, while I imagine many fans of gritty street rap would feel that rap engineered to be friendly to academic vegan anarchists is not, in fact, keeping it real. All of this is incorrect. What the proper topic for rap was occurred to me when I read words of Martin Buber in I and Thou: that the experience of the I and Thou is a transaction that does not have content. I tried to imagine a relationship, a transaction, without content, and it sprang to mind: hip-hop lyrics! Lyrics with a capital L, the type of hip-hop lyrics that are written to be purely about the writing, performing and listening to of the song. Lyrics about themselves! Even though many hip-hop lyrics do not have any content, a relationship is still established between the performer and listener. The proper subject of hip-hop is neither political revolution, or criminal exploits. The proper subject of hip-hop is the creation of hip-hop itself. As the Wu-Tang Clan puts it, merely in the process of \"living out their name\", of defining and defending themselves, an MC exists. It isn't that hip-hop can't have content, that it can't communicate ideas from an unlucky road trip to the identification of the ten sefiroth and ten Dharma realms, it is that all of these subjects, no matter how meaningful, are not interrupted by bragging without content. They are founded in it. Again, let us look at Rakim, speaking with what has to be playful recursion and profound religious meaning:\nI am the R to the A to the KIM\nIf I wasn't why would I say I am\n\n\"Hip-Hop was never a fad, it was always a permanent thing.\" - Toine\nToine is one half of the Maryland duo DTMD (Dunc & Toine Makin' Dollas) and is praised for his merticulous and intellectual delivery coupled with the depth of his music knowledge. Photo courtesy of Orlando Urbina\nCan you remember the first Hip-Hop song you ever heard and what feelings it inspired in you? Toine: I don’t really remember one that stood out. I grew up with it, so to distinguish a song as Hip-Hop and not Hip-Hop, I never even thought about it. I was lucky enough—or I don’t even know if I’m lucky enough—to grow up always having rap as an option. I’m not old enough to have had R&B be the main level of music for the youth. Hip-Hop was never a fad it was always a permanent thing. I remember being really young, I guess like two years old my mom had me on tape talking about “Too Legit to Quit.” And “Gin and Juice.” I was sipping lemon juice since I didn’t know what Gin was back then. Those two songs stand out in my earliest memories. Who were the artists whose career and work has been a source of inspiration to you? Toine: I’ll have to say Common from about '94 to '05…I feel like Common with his albums really grows [as an artist]…I don’t think he really made the same album twice. He’ll make an album then give a more polished feel on it in the next one…when he was Common Sense he was weird, he was sharp, extremely sharp and he was a real serious battle rap cat. He was the first rapper I really paid attention to with intellectual punchlines. He would have “I’m nicer than you, I’m this and that,” but a lot of his lines that had punch to them would be really introspective stuff that kind of made you think. When I really first started writing I was modeling myself after Common of that era. What do you consider some of the most influential contributions made to Hip-Hop in the past 40 years? Toine: Sheesh okay. I guess the invention of rapping over breaks [laughs]. If no one ever rapped over breaks whatever we have today would not exist in the same way. DJs would still be the kings and not the rappers—which I have no problem with but I feel like it should be about the music and not everything else. But just the thought of people rapping over breaks that makes Hip-Hop what it is today. Where do you see Hip-Hop evolving in the next 40 years given its current direction? Toine: I really don’t know. Hip-Hop follows the people and if the people stay on this trajectory I can see this, not ceasing to exist but…people’s appreciation for music dwindle. It’s too easy to put music out. The internet is giving people a false sense of entitlement, putting them on a pedestal that may or may not be warranted. The music industry as a whole is uh—quality control is a thing of the past. I’m not really as optimistic about the quality of the music…I hope it will be good. What do you consider your generation’s great contribution to Hip-Hop? Toine: …We’re a lot more technologically savvy. I feel we embrace more alternatives than rap. A lot of people, even Hip-Hop artists, are into more genres than rap, and even incorporate non-historically Black styles into their music now.\n\nFor that reason, if we’re going to present a society that has cohesion, then these art venues have to present the arts that come from all different sides of the community, particularly an art form that doesn’t say this is only for this type of person. Hip Hop just doesn’t say that. Could you talk about Hip Hop as an umbrella term in terms of Dance? As far as Hip Hop Culture is concerned, Breakin’ is the only form that was developing at the time period in The Bronx. However, within the disenfranchised black communities in the West, the same type of dance form, which was used as a language of the people, was simultaneously developing and that is what connects these forms together. Now for me, I’ve never been to a Hip Hop jam and seen dancers there that are only Bboys or Bgirls, I’ve always seen Popper’s or Krump dancers. I’ve never been to a Poppin’ jam and not seen breakers throwing down. So for me, the segregation of it is detail but the reality doesn’t sum it up for me. I see Break Dance, Poppin’ and Lockin’ all in the same place because it’s the same generation. The roots of one form might be from one side of America and another form from the other side of America, but actually, to only think of those two places in the whole world of the dance culture of the disenfranchised, I think it limits the potential of what we can do when it comes to unifying our language. Who are your favourite Hip Hop artists? Historically, Ken swift, who is a Bboy. He will always mention. Megus. He’s a Canadian Bboy. He has some incredible threading techniques. KRS ONE. No doubt he will always be a major influence for me being a MC. Black Thought from The Roots. I connected with Black Thought when he first came to England and their first show in London they invited me on stage to be apart of their set (the first ever gig they did in London). Where graffiti writers are concerned, I really love DAIM from Germany. He’s got this dope 3D style. I also like ODEITH he did a piece at Breakin’ Convention three years ago. He’s got this really unique special effects style which involves doing a piece on a corner and depending on where you stand it looks like its coming out. It’s incredible. In South Africa there’s a MC called Hymphatic Thabs. He’s onto the next level. Very underground but I think he’s an incredible MC. Audio\/Visual which were a collective of MCS that were pushing the form in the mid to late 90’s. Kendrick Lemar mainly for that brilliant album and MF DOOM because he’s just always pushing the boundaries lyrically. He’s got a very monotone style, which makes him a bit like marmite. You either love him or you just don’t get it. What do you think is the future of Hip Hop? I am going answer this question how I feel everyone should answer this question — like what Mos Def said:\n‘Don’t worry about what Hip Hop is doing, worry about what you’re doing’\nand it makes me then say Hip Hop theatre is going to go global just like what we’re doing with Breakin Convention. We’re doing four dates in America. We’re also doing Canada and Luxembourg. Sweden and Holland are both interested. So, there is a global thing going on with Breakin’ Convention. I also think that the forms of Grime for example will have an influence, which I think are Hip Hop. Again, we’re are just trying to divide and make everything super detailed when we have so much more in common than we do apart. I’m quite keen to say that it’s part of the world, however you want to say it. I would like to think that it’s all connected. I think that in this increasingly fascist system that the world is going through, not just England and America, that a lot of the media is pressurising us to fight amongst ourselves. I think this is in response to the obvious imbalance in resources. The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer, so it doesn’t surprise me that the media will try to enforce on us things that make us start arguing amongst ourselves. Hip Hop is the antithesis of that so I believe that Hip Hop is going to be responsible for helping to heal society.","passages":[{"passage":"Everyone I had worked with on my early projects is gone -- they’ve all been fired and there are new guys coming in that think they can teach old dogs new tricks. They bring these people in and give them job functions that had been covered by multiple people in the past. It makes it hard to know what to expect from the records. What sort of impact do you think this has had on music itself? There’s no lack of interesting and good music coming out, it’s just the way the system works now. I’d like to have the comfort of thinking that everything that has happened to me hasn’t been luck; it’s been me making good decisions. When I don’t understand what’s going on, I just try to sit and watch. It’s about trying to fit into the scheme of where things are going in the future. I’m an artist that wrote about the harsh realities and that’s always what’s translated the strongest about my music. In film thusfar, I’ve only taken on characters that embodied the same mannerisms or attitudes. I’m trying to broaden peoples' perception of me, so that when they see me they don’t pigeonhole me as being only able to do one thing. Does the evolving industry make it more difficult for you to make music or does it have no impact whatsoever? It’s hard if you’re not in a position where the machine is behind you non-stop. I’m lucky to be an artist that doesn’t have to look for press. If I say anything controversial in this interview, they’ll take this and run it on all the blogs. What do you think about the evolution of hip-hop from gangsta archetypes to skinny jean-wearing hyper-emotional types? It’s missing what I fell in love with about hip-hop culture. There’s almost no one creating or making the type of hip-hop that I grew up on. I’m a huge Ice Cube fan — I still watch Cube like I’ve never sold a record. I still watch his interviews and study him. He came from the position where his music reflected the aggressions and harsh realities of life, and now he’s highly respected on a broader scope. You can see a television show based on a movie he made. It’s interesting to watch someone's personal choices and how they impact their career. Dre is different from me — his relationship with Jimmy Iovine will allow him to stay relevant regardless of what he does. He can stay home for another 10 years and then put out a record and it will get tons of promotion... He’ll always be a priority. Whatever happened with the Rick Ross feud? Did you ever talk to him and clear the air? I never had a conversation with him. My focus shifted during that record. A lot of times, earlier in my career, I was competing with artists because that was what I loved about hip-hop: The idea that battling someone was necessary to defend your spot and you had to take on all challengers — so I did that constantly. No one thinks that way now and everyone looks at me like I’m the Broad Street Bully. The younger kids coming up missed that time frame, and even the conscious rap is gone, too. The stuff that Common Sense and Talib Kweli and Mos Def were rhyming about. What was socially conscious and responsible about the music has been replaced by hipster kids in skinny jeans and mohawks. Of course, that’s always been around, but it was usually confined to the Village. Artists have always had the opportunity to influence the culture, but now it’s the other way around: They’re trying to look like their audience to attract their audience. Now you can’t tell the difference between a Led Zeppelin fan and a hip-hop fan. Do you think this is just part of a natural ebb and flow of cultural change? It’s a cyclical shift. It’s like fashion, everything is recycled and comes back. I’m really excited by it. Sometimes, it’s best to just take a look at what’s going on and observe. On my first album, I was writing to one concept. With “Black Magic,” I wrote a bunch of material, but now I have time to spend on what I have to offer. I think it should be my best work.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:7a388a19-2a38-4b87-ada3-db14ec5ac33e>"]},{"passage":"Something like \"Cruise\" really does show how similar music from different parts of the country really can be.

It's got the coolest black kids, it's got the coolest white kids, it's got the coolest Asian kids, it's got the coolest girls, the coolest guys, the jocks, the coolest nerd, you see what I'm saying? It's the mixture. Even with Florida Georgia Line, they're some pretty young guys they're like 27, you look at Nelly, this is my 16th year so those guys [knew me] since they were freakin' 11, I hate to say that shit [Laughs.] They've been influenced by myself and things of that nature, so when they come to the music they have no choice but to put some of the influence of what they've been listening to. Well this year marks the 15th anniversary of Country Grammar. What did you do differently on that record, compared to how you make records now? Man, it's a great saying, \"You have a lifetime to make your first record, you got a year to make every one after that.\" That's basically it. When you're talking about Country Grammar, man, we were waiting since I started rapping to make that album. How was it different technically? It's a difference in the sound. I was kinda the only one doing what I was doing, now the whole fucking game is singing. [Laughs.] The whole game is melodic now, and I was the only one doing it. You know? I was the first one to sing his own hook, rap his own verses and sing his own bridge. And continuously doing that because my influences, such as Bone Thugs, Goodie Mob, Cee-Lo Green and Arrested Development, you're listening to 'em and trying to find your own niche and then when you come with it but you come with it in a way that's so surprising to people. People don't understand that, shit, the whole game is doing Nelly. Do you get rappers saying, \"Thanks for hooking this up. Thanks for making this happen?\" Nah man, it's all good. Obviously, when you meet other artists, other artists definitely show their appreciation. . . . It's kind of hard to find someone that sings and raps that wasn't a Nelly fan. And it's a little easier to do it now because of Auto-Tune. I didn't have Auto-Tune. That was straight my notes. I had to work that shit out. I had to actually hit notes. Are you anti-Auto-Tune? No, no, no. I'm not anti-anything. It's just used so much now, it just sounds like the norm. That's why I say I'm not \"anti.\" One thing I know and I understand is evolution. Everything must change. . . . Hip-hop was created by the youth for the youth. So, you got to let the youth take it where they're gonna take it. If you want to be involved, be involved. If you don't, you don't. It's getting to a point now where hip-hop has a history. Older people, when I was younger, they didn't have hip-hop. If they didn't like it, they just listened to whatever they wanted to do. Now I'm a parent. I had hip-hop, so I don't have to listen to their hip hop. I can listen to my hip-hop. But we're still listening to hip-hop. Listen, I could be 65 years old, if Jay-Z's having a concert, I'm there. We're in a different era now. I'm not gonna never stop wearing Jordans. I mean unless another company gives me a hellafied check to stop wearing 'em. I don't care if I'm 80, I'mma put on some sneakers. And it's just one of those things that back in the day, it was a certain way you had to dress if you were older. \"Why do you have that baseball cap on? C'mon, you're a 50 year-old man.

Hip-hop artists of all stripes are constantly sampling, referencing, and quoting artists from the past, creatively reconstructing their family trees. Every once in a while, an emcee takes this to the next level. They become lyrical historians, narrating the evolution of hip-hop and its art forms. I’ve always been a sucker for this genre of song, ever since I was a kid in the Boston suburbs scanning the radio dial intently to learn everything I could about this incredible sound coming from the nation’s urban centers. In this post, I share twelve songs about hip-hop history, some famous and some lesser known. Unless you’re extremely well-informed, it’ll probably take some additional research to get all the references (Rap Genius can help, http:\/\/rap.genius.com\/). For teachers, these songs could come in handy as prompts for classroom discussions. For example, conversations about what these songs include, and what they leave out, could be extremely informative. These songs don’t really tell the whole story. They are pretty US-heavy and overly-nostalgic, and there are plenty of gaps. For one, I couldn’t find any written by women (if you know any, please comment!). Still, if you’re looking to dive into hip-hop’s roots, here are some guides to lead you. 1. South Bronx, by Boogie Down Productions\nIt’s generally agreed that hip-hop as we know it today first emerged in the South Bronx, so there’s no better song to start with than South Bronx, by KRS-One and Scott LaRock. This song was written in response to MC Shan and DJ Marley Marl’s, The Bridge, which claimed Queens, NY, as hip-hop’s birthplace. It’s clear today who won this argument. 2. Knowledge is Power, by Akala\nOf course, hip-hop didn’t appear in the South Bronx out of nowhere. It’s roots lie deep in African, African-American, Afro-Caribbean, and Latin American musical and oral traditions. In Knowledge is Power, UK-based emcee Akala calls the Bronx-based origin story a “myth,” and argues that those who love hip-hop need to look much deeper into its antecedents. 3. Lune Tns, by Company Flow\nToday the emcee has become the preeminent image of the hip-hop artist. But, of course, rapping is only one of the hip-hop elements. In Lune Tns, Bigg Jus of Company Flow pays homage to the great and lesser known graffiti artists of New York City. 4. Gangsta Rap, by Ice T\nHip-hop may have originally coalesced in New York, but it quickly spread. In Gangsta Rap, Ice T recounts how hip-hop was picked up by artists on the West Coast. There, hip-hop and local gang culture converged to birth West coast gangsta rap, which then took the world by storm (for good and ill). 5. Latinos Stand Up (Remix), by Chino XL, Sick Jacken, Thirstin Howl, B Real, Sinful, and Kid Frost\nLatinos artists have been part of hip-hop’s evolution since its birth, but have often been unrecognized for their contributions. In this song, some of the most well-known Latino rappers join together to represent for the Latin hip-hop tradition. 6. Underground Heaven, by Cesar Comanche\nUnderground Heaven highlights the central role of the DJ\/Producer in creating the sound we recognize today as hip-hop music. It’s something of an ode to the independent record store and the sample, and has a great verse that rolls through some of the most classic samples in hip-hop. 7. I Used To Love H.E.R., by Common\nIn this famous song, Common narrates the evolution of hip-hop metaphorically, personifying hip-hop as a woman with whom he has a sort of on-again, off-again relationship.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e0611a38-30c6-490a-b139-1622d0c33d9e>"]},{"passage":"and MTV's Sway Calloway provides: \"The detail that manufactured that period so wonderful is that absolutely nothing was contrived.

Lyrics about law enforcement, for example, frequently portrayed cops as predators exercising an illegitimate power. Imprisonment, likewise, was blamed for weakening familial and community relationships and described a modern method of oppression. The study’s authors concluded that “the overwhelming message in hip-hop wasn’t that the rappers disliked the idea of justice, but they disliked the way it was being implemented.” More insights from the authors via Meredith Mohr:\n“[T]he music is maturing, evolving,” Henderson said. “Take Jay-Z for example. If you look at his lyrical content from 1990-2012, you see the evolution from talking about drug selling at the beginning of his career to now talking about meeting with the president, helping with the campaign. It’s a very different conversation. We never saw an artist go backwards. You only saw them mature as they age, and experience and their music changes with them.”\nPart of this, Henderson said, is because the audience has also changed with the artists. “Jay-Z’s listenership has aged with him,” Henderson said. “Part of it is that artists recognize that if they go back and talk about that very animalistic behavior, their listeners are going to say, ‘hey listen, this is not what I want to hear,’ and they’re going to go somewhere else.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ec126d0e-d5ee-40c1-930e-ecb573472b2c>"]},{"passage":"spawned a new breed of rapper, styled as gun-toting hoodlum supposedly giving suburban America a frightening peek into ghetto life the group knew from pretty early on that about 80 percent of the people buying their albums were white, middle-class kids. Although the industry was happy to cash in, pressure by conservative advocacy groups on major corporations such as Time Warner (parent company of TIME.com) resulted in the industry backing away from promoting gangsta rap. \"Hip-Hop Nation\" includes original correspondence detailing efforts by Ice-T to be released from his Warner Brothers contract after the corporation had sought to curb certain lyrics. Gangsta rap, with its narrative tales and its cinematic funk-driven sound, offered a distinct alternative to the tricky bebop gymnastics of the freestyling East Coast. But hip-hop came close to destroying itself in the mid-'90s when that bicoastal rivalry almost turned into a shooting war, as Tupac Shakur between surviving shootings and spells in prison threatened the life of Brooklyn rapper the Notorious B.I.G. and both men, former friends, were by the end of 1997 dead in as-yet-unsolved drive-by shootings. But while most hip-hop fans today may be well versed in the tale of Tupac and Biggie, the show transports them back to an era they may find hard to imagine. After all, the almost pharaonic fantasy world of a Puffy Combs video is light-years away from the hand-stenciled mimeographs with crude sketches advertising an around-the-way appearance of Kurtis Blow or a block party featuring Grandmaster Flash. This was a do-it yourself movement in the outer boroughs, a culture being built by hand, brick by brick one to which the suits running the music industry in the glass towers across the river were mostly impervious for more than a decade. And for kids grown accustomed to hip-hop as the bearer of grim tales of death and destruction, \"Hip-Hop Nation\" offers a glimpse of a reminder that the cultural roots were in joyous block parties and people having getting together to have a good time no matter how grim their circumstances. That much is summed up in the words of one pioneering DJ carried in a video installation: \"If there was negativity and fights breaking out at your party, that means your DJ was whack.\" IT WAS AT THOSE PARTIES in the \"Boogie Down\" South Bronx where hip-hop's founding fathers Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaata and Grandmaster Flash first began delivering spoken rhymes over the break beats on funk and disco records sometime in the mid-'70s. Today the signature beats-and-rhymes combination of the musical art form they created is as ubiquitous in America's tony suburbs as in its forgotten housing projects, and has kids in distant parts of the world whose first language may be French or Japanese or Wolof chanting choruses inviting their friends to \"get at me, dawg.\" Hip-hop's language not simply its slang, which is as likely to be heard in Yale dorm rooms as on inner-city street corners, but its idiom, which involves combining the spoken (or screamed) word with a pastiche of musical elements drawn from previous songs and styles reassembled in new and unique combinations is not only the preeminent musical genre of a generation, it's also a complex, ever-evolving organism that has spawned countless dialects that are constantly in conversation with one another. HIP-HOP CULTURE may be difficult to define, but it is pervasive nonetheless. It began simply as a combination of four art forms deejaying, rapping, break dancing and graffiti tagging but it quickly evolved into a cultural revolution in which young African-Americans literally remade their America. In the spirit of Malcolm X and the Black Panthers, they didn't simply demand to be admitted as an equal in Whitey's world; they created their own popular culture grounded in the lived reality and aspirations of black life in America. Far from demanding to join the club, the hip-hop kids created their own. And once they'd built it, Whitey came, desperately seeking access to the \"cool\" that, as Norman Mailer famously noted, has in postwar urban America been inexorably associated with blackness.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:4186a596-cbc5-4679-858a-47c8818bb34f>"]},{"passage":"It’s still things that’s relevant to this time period, but I just wanted “in your face” lyrics, real hard, soulful; just a big kaleidoscope of music, a little bit of everything, somethin’ for everybody. GW: Do you feel a lot of rappers in the game are doing music as a side job? Quest: I wouldn’t even say that. The way hip-hop is to the younger people is that it’s really no talent involved. A lot of people think they can just jump on the microphone, go, “yayayaya…” on beat and it sound good. That’s not really what it is, you know what I’m sayin? Back in the day, you couldn’t just get on the mic and rap. Right now, it’s easy to get $500 together, get a audio interface, a microphone, some beats on SoundClick, and call yourself a rapper. I think that’s a little too easy. If I get a chance, I at least try to school some of the younger, upcoming rappers. Try to incorporate some lyrics. Learn a lil’ bit about what’s goin’ on in hip-hop before you just jump into a song. People think rap is easy and it’s really not if you do it right. We’re just makin’ hip-hop wack. If the average listener listens to somebody who’s a local and they promotin’ their mixtape, or whatever, and it’s corny, they’re not gonna take the chance to listen to nobody else. Music is so quick and disposable now, you got even mainstream artists doin’ two or three mixtapes a year now. They would put out an album every two or three years. GW: On “Dat Knock,” you address a female. Are you drawn to a female’s intellect before her body or what covers it? Quest: For females walkin’ around with a Gucci bag, Prada shoes, a Gucci hat, whatever, that’s not gon’ define who she is when that’s not on her. Have a conversation, your shoes, hat, and purse is not gon’ talk to you. That’s cool for the time bein’, I’m with somebody now, but if I’m with somebody, they have to have some type of conversation. Once you get out the club, you gotta talk. I want to know where you at. God forbid, we in a situation, I need you to be on point. I need you to be intelligent enough to make a rational decision. Who wouldn’t want a woman who doesn’t do that? GW: Is the rap game a dream, like the title of your track, “The Dream?”\nQuest: One of my theories is, rap is gonna become fly fishin’. You know how people in the ‘90s just go fly fishin’? It’s gonna be like that with hip-hop, where people are just old, they still love hip-hop, still make hip-hop, and still have love and a drive for hip-hop. If I wanna make beats at 60, I’m gonna make a beat. Just like when you go to the basketball court, it be like 50, 60-year-old dudes out there say, “I got next.” If you still successful within yourself, takin’ care of business, I say do what you wanna do. GW: Do you always do what you want to do with your music or do you compromise with other artists? Quest: I have to compromise when it comes to production jobs. As long as I don’t do anything too crazy, off the wall, nobody will say anything to me. They [managers and JSL] kinda trust my judgment when I’m makin’ music. I try not to say, “I’ma do this ‘cause such and such is doin’ this.” I’ma do what comes from my heart and soul when it comes to music. I ain’t gon’ try to force feed you anything. GW: You have a song called, “UShudaKnown.” What’s something you feel everyone should know? Quest: We had a conversation in the studio about Illuminati. Illuminati is the big thing in hip-hop and I think that’s pretty lame. There’s things that need a little more time and devotion than Illuminati. I think people are lookin’ too deep into things and not realizing that it’s music. This is just a term brought up now to have somethin’ to talk about, targetin’ hip-hop.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:1c444f5d-d4fc-4903-97d9-340bdce9855b>"]},{"passage":"I think I got it locked, just smooth while I latch it\nQ-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest, Steve Biko\nMy pen taps the paper and my brain's blank\nNas, Memory Lane\nI'm voices in your subconscious, knots in your intestines\nCrescent moon attack stance if you glance at the mic\n-Casual from Hieroglyphics, Dune Methane\nI'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells\nNow come aboard, it's Medina bound\nEnter the chamber, and it's a whole different sound\nIt's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel\nSo deep it's picked up on radios in tunnels\nGZA from the Wu-Tang Clan, Liquid Swords\nAnd, of course, some words from the master:\nWait by the radio hand on the dial soon\nAs you hear it, pump up the volume\nDance with the speaker til you hear it blow\nThen plug in your headphone because there it go\nAnd, most tellingly:\nI am the R, to the A to the KIM\nIf I wasn't, why would I say I am? Rakim, Pump up the Volume and As the Rhyme Goes On. Please excuse me for starting this with so many quotes, but once I start quoting great hip-hop songs, it is hard for me to stop. I also wanted to introduce this without introduction, showing hip-hop as it is without discussing the political and social viewpoints and misviewpoints first. I first started listening to hip-hop when I bought a Public Enemy tape in 1994, and I immediately responded to the message. For me, Public Enemy wasn't that much different from Neil Young, both were putting righteous anger to music. But I liked the sound itself, and soon enough, I started branching out into other hip-hop acts, but mostly ones with some sort of message, even if it was the more subtle messages of say, De La Soul. Substance was important for me. The fact that half of rap consisted of bragging seemed to be a necessary evil. Some of those songs and lyrics inspired me, but I always associated them somehow with something else, perhaps as an extension of the messages I heard in other lyrics. If you ask hip-hop fans how they got started, and you will hear many different stories, but this one isn't uncommon. For middle class kids, social consciousness is often the reason to start listening to hip-hop. There is currently about twenty years of debate and warfare in hip-hop about what constitutes hip-hop, with the authenticity of various viewpoints challenged. Many socially conscious rappers and fans feel that rap with criminal themes is a marketing plot to sell fantasies to suburbanites, while I imagine many fans of gritty street rap would feel that rap engineered to be friendly to academic vegan anarchists is not, in fact, keeping it real. All of this is incorrect. What the proper topic for rap was occurred to me when I read words of Martin Buber in I and Thou: that the experience of the I and Thou is a transaction that does not have content. I tried to imagine a relationship, a transaction, without content, and it sprang to mind: hip-hop lyrics! Lyrics with a capital L, the type of hip-hop lyrics that are written to be purely about the writing, performing and listening to of the song. Lyrics about themselves! Even though many hip-hop lyrics do not have any content, a relationship is still established between the performer and listener. The proper subject of hip-hop is neither political revolution, or criminal exploits. The proper subject of hip-hop is the creation of hip-hop itself. As the Wu-Tang Clan puts it, merely in the process of \"living out their name\", of defining and defending themselves, an MC exists. It isn't that hip-hop can't have content, that it can't communicate ideas from an unlucky road trip to the identification of the ten sefiroth and ten Dharma realms, it is that all of these subjects, no matter how meaningful, are not interrupted by bragging without content. They are founded in it. Again, let us look at Rakim, speaking with what has to be playful recursion and profound religious meaning:\nI am the R to the A to the KIM\nIf I wasn't why would I say I am","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:b2b9d89a-2574-4d02-95ff-71fe466e6273>"]},{"passage":"\"Hip-Hop was never a fad, it was always a permanent thing.\" - Toine\nToine is one half of the Maryland duo DTMD (Dunc & Toine Makin' Dollas) and is praised for his merticulous and intellectual delivery coupled with the depth of his music knowledge. Photo courtesy of Orlando Urbina\nCan you remember the first Hip-Hop song you ever heard and what feelings it inspired in you? Toine: I don’t really remember one that stood out. I grew up with it, so to distinguish a song as Hip-Hop and not Hip-Hop, I never even thought about it. I was lucky enough—or I don’t even know if I’m lucky enough—to grow up always having rap as an option. I’m not old enough to have had R&B be the main level of music for the youth. Hip-Hop was never a fad it was always a permanent thing. I remember being really young, I guess like two years old my mom had me on tape talking about “Too Legit to Quit.” And “Gin and Juice.” I was sipping lemon juice since I didn’t know what Gin was back then. Those two songs stand out in my earliest memories. Who were the artists whose career and work has been a source of inspiration to you? Toine: I’ll have to say Common from about '94 to '05…I feel like Common with his albums really grows [as an artist]…I don’t think he really made the same album twice. He’ll make an album then give a more polished feel on it in the next one…when he was Common Sense he was weird, he was sharp, extremely sharp and he was a real serious battle rap cat. He was the first rapper I really paid attention to with intellectual punchlines. He would have “I’m nicer than you, I’m this and that,” but a lot of his lines that had punch to them would be really introspective stuff that kind of made you think. When I really first started writing I was modeling myself after Common of that era. What do you consider some of the most influential contributions made to Hip-Hop in the past 40 years? Toine: Sheesh okay. I guess the invention of rapping over breaks [laughs]. If no one ever rapped over breaks whatever we have today would not exist in the same way. DJs would still be the kings and not the rappers—which I have no problem with but I feel like it should be about the music and not everything else. But just the thought of people rapping over breaks that makes Hip-Hop what it is today. Where do you see Hip-Hop evolving in the next 40 years given its current direction? Toine: I really don’t know. Hip-Hop follows the people and if the people stay on this trajectory I can see this, not ceasing to exist but…people’s appreciation for music dwindle. It’s too easy to put music out. The internet is giving people a false sense of entitlement, putting them on a pedestal that may or may not be warranted. The music industry as a whole is uh—quality control is a thing of the past. I’m not really as optimistic about the quality of the music…I hope it will be good. What do you consider your generation’s great contribution to Hip-Hop? Toine: …We’re a lot more technologically savvy. I feel we embrace more alternatives than rap. A lot of people, even Hip-Hop artists, are into more genres than rap, and even incorporate non-historically Black styles into their music now.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:fe1b6d7e-9131-416c-ae8a-de6aa28f17f9>"]},{"passage":"For that reason, if we’re going to present a society that has cohesion, then these art venues have to present the arts that come from all different sides of the community, particularly an art form that doesn’t say this is only for this type of person. Hip Hop just doesn’t say that. Could you talk about Hip Hop as an umbrella term in terms of Dance? As far as Hip Hop Culture is concerned, Breakin’ is the only form that was developing at the time period in The Bronx. However, within the disenfranchised black communities in the West, the same type of dance form, which was used as a language of the people, was simultaneously developing and that is what connects these forms together. Now for me, I’ve never been to a Hip Hop jam and seen dancers there that are only Bboys or Bgirls, I’ve always seen Popper’s or Krump dancers. I’ve never been to a Poppin’ jam and not seen breakers throwing down. So for me, the segregation of it is detail but the reality doesn’t sum it up for me. I see Break Dance, Poppin’ and Lockin’ all in the same place because it’s the same generation. The roots of one form might be from one side of America and another form from the other side of America, but actually, to only think of those two places in the whole world of the dance culture of the disenfranchised, I think it limits the potential of what we can do when it comes to unifying our language. Who are your favourite Hip Hop artists? Historically, Ken swift, who is a Bboy. He will always mention. Megus. He’s a Canadian Bboy. He has some incredible threading techniques. KRS ONE. No doubt he will always be a major influence for me being a MC. Black Thought from The Roots. I connected with Black Thought when he first came to England and their first show in London they invited me on stage to be apart of their set (the first ever gig they did in London). Where graffiti writers are concerned, I really love DAIM from Germany. He’s got this dope 3D style. I also like ODEITH he did a piece at Breakin’ Convention three years ago. He’s got this really unique special effects style which involves doing a piece on a corner and depending on where you stand it looks like its coming out. It’s incredible. In South Africa there’s a MC called Hymphatic Thabs. He’s onto the next level. Very underground but I think he’s an incredible MC. Audio\/Visual which were a collective of MCS that were pushing the form in the mid to late 90’s. Kendrick Lemar mainly for that brilliant album and MF DOOM because he’s just always pushing the boundaries lyrically. He’s got a very monotone style, which makes him a bit like marmite. You either love him or you just don’t get it. What do you think is the future of Hip Hop? I am going answer this question how I feel everyone should answer this question — like what Mos Def said:\n‘Don’t worry about what Hip Hop is doing, worry about what you’re doing’\nand it makes me then say Hip Hop theatre is going to go global just like what we’re doing with Breakin Convention. We’re doing four dates in America. We’re also doing Canada and Luxembourg. Sweden and Holland are both interested. So, there is a global thing going on with Breakin’ Convention. I also think that the forms of Grime for example will have an influence, which I think are Hip Hop. Again, we’re are just trying to divide and make everything super detailed when we have so much more in common than we do apart. I’m quite keen to say that it’s part of the world, however you want to say it. I would like to think that it’s all connected. I think that in this increasingly fascist system that the world is going through, not just England and America, that a lot of the media is pressurising us to fight amongst ourselves. I think this is in response to the obvious imbalance in resources. The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer, so it doesn’t surprise me that the media will try to enforce on us things that make us start arguing amongst ourselves. Hip Hop is the antithesis of that so I believe that Hip Hop is going to be responsible for helping to heal society.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:a7ec318c-56c3-40b2-aaf9-a417c401e037>"]}]}

After receiving many compliments and buying a lot of pieces as gifts for friends and family, I decided to spread my love for Polish pottery and Groshek Pottery was born. Groshek (or groszek) means \"polka dot\" in Polish, which reflects the many beautiful spotty designs that Polish pottery is renowned for. What is Polish pottery? Every piece of Polish pottery is handmade and hand-decorated using stamps and brushes. It comes in hundreds of shapes, with patterns ranging from classic dots and “peacock eyes” to more intricate “artistic” or “UNIKAT” patterns. My pottery comes from Zaklady Ceramiczne “Boleslawiec”, which is one of the biggest manufacturers in the region and whose tradition goes back to the 19th century. Caring for your pottery\nThe high quality of the clay combined with the manufacturing process make Polish pottery extremely durable. Fired at over 1200°C, it is classed as stoneware and safe to use in dishwashers, microwaves and fridges. This makes Polish pottery suitable for everyday use at home and in catering. All dishes with a grooved bottom are also safe to use in traditional gas or electric ovens up to 280°C, as well as on glass, ceramic and electric hobs.\n\nThis Polish pottery Bowl\nis made by Ceramika Artystyczna\nworkshop in Boleslawiec, Poland.

Every piece of Polish pottery is handmade and hand-decorated using stamps and brushes. It comes in hundreds of shapes, with patterns ranging from classic dots and “peacock eyes” to more intricate “artistic” or “UNIKAT” patterns. My pottery comes from Zaklady Ceramiczne “Boleslawiec”, which is one of the biggest manufacturers in the region and whose tradition goes back to the 19th century. Caring for your pottery\nThe high quality of the clay combined with the manufacturing process make Polish pottery extremely durable. Fired at over 1200°C, it is classed as stoneware and safe to use in dishwashers, microwaves and fridges. This makes Polish pottery suitable for everyday use at home and in catering. All dishes with a grooved bottom are also safe to use in traditional gas or electric ovens up to 280°C, as well as on glass, ceramic and electric hobs.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:97f8451b-bf37-41bf-8ee0-54bb5d7594a9>"]},{"passage":"This Polish pottery Bowl\nis made by Ceramika Artystyczna\nworkshop in Boleslawiec, Poland.

(Getting Ready to Take Some Ground) Introduction: This is week four in our series “Eight Essential Exercises for Building a Better Body.” We’ve seen our need to find our strength in the Lord. Without His strength, we can’t even complete the rest of the exercises and our relationships will suffer. We’ve seen our need to make certain that our relationships are supported by and grounded in integrity. Without that belt of truth strapped around us, we cannot stand and our relationships crumble. Last week we considered the need to access the righteousness of Christ. We need to be right with God before we can be right in our relationships with others, and the way we get right with God is we allow the righteousness of Christ to be given to us. And then we ask him to fill us, to dwell in us and actually change our character so that we are truly a righteous people. This week we need to consider our need to be actively preparing to advance. The motto of the Boy Scouts is “always be prepared.” That’s a great motto, and Paul understood the need to be prepared. When he told us to have on, or put on the shoes of readiness that result from the Gospel he we was telling us to be prepared. A man without shoes is not prepared for much. In order to be prepared for action, a soldier on the front lines will sleep with his boots on at times. Having shoes on your feet is a symbol of readiness. It means you are prepared for action. You are prepared to go somewhere. When Merita and I take the kids and leave the house, the last thing we do is get shoes on all the kids. Once all of the shoes are on, then we are ready to go. You don’t leave the house to go someplace without shoes. Having your shoes on means that you’re ready. Paul knew that the soldier in his day wore shoes that kept him prepared for action. Often when we think of the shoes worn in the Mediterranean world of the first century we think of sandals. But the sandals worn by the Roman soldier were different than the sandals worn by the every day citizen. The sandals of the Roman soldier were designed for war, not for peace. When on duty he kept his sandals on so that he would be ready for action. To be prepared for combat you need quite a different shoe than you do for going to the corner store. These were specialized sandals. They had a thick sole to protect the soldiers feet from the hot sand and from sharp rocks. They also had nails driven through the soles, giving the sandals the ability to hold firm on sandy or slippery ground. Good footing was essential in winning a war and these shoes gave the soldier the good footing he needed. He wouldn’t slip or loose ground because the spikes would bite into the earth and help him hold firm. These shoes also helped the soldier to advance. A retreating army is rarely a winning army, but an army that can advance and take ground is an army that wins wars. The shoes of the soldier are designed for taking ground, advancing, and holding that ground, standing firm.","question_category":"first turn question; Natural","question_category_desc":"the initial question of a conversation, and therefore self-contained and understandable, without any other context.; phrased in the way people typically speak, reflecting everyday language use, without formal or artificial structure.","user_category":"Expert","user_category_desc":"A specialized user with deep understanding of the corpus.","question":"What was the strategic importance of the spiked soles in Roman military footwear?","gold":"The spiked soles in Roman military footwear were strategically important because they helped soldiers maintain firm footing during battle, which was essential for winning wars.

Throughout the territory under Rome's control, residential architecture ranged from very modest houses to country villas, and in the capital city of Rome, to the residences on the elegant Palatine Hill, from which the word \"palace\" is derived. The vast majority of the population lived in the city center, packed into apartment blocks. Most Roman towns and cities had a forum and temples, as did the city of Rome itself. Aqueducts were built to bring water to urban centers and wine and cooking oil were imported from abroad. Landlords generally resided in cities and their estates were left in the care of farm managers. To stimulate a higher labour productivity, many landlords freed large numbers of slaves. Beginning in the middle of the 2nd century BC, Greek culture was increasingly ascendant, in spite of tirades against the \"softening\" effects of Hellenised culture. By the time of Augustus, cultured Greek household slaves taught the Roman young (sometimes even the girls). Greek sculptures adorned Hellenistic landscape gardening on the Palatine or in the villas, and much Roman cuisine was essentially Greek. Roman writers disdained Latin for a cultured Greek style. Social history and structure\nMany aspects of Roman culture were borrowed from the Greeks. In architecture and sculpture, the difference between Greek models and Roman paintings are apparent. The chief Roman contributions to architecture were the arch and the dome. Rome has also had a tremendous impact on European cultures following it. Its significance is perhaps best reflected in its endurance and influence, as is seen in the longevity and lasting importance of works of Virgil and Ovid. Latin, the Republic's primary language, remains used for liturgical purposes by the Roman Catholic Church, and up to the 19th century was used extensively in scholarly writings in, for example, science and mathematics. Roman law laid the foundations for the laws of many European countries and their colonies. The center of the early social structure was the family, which was not only marked by blood relations but also by the legally constructed relation of patria potestas. The Pater familias was the absolute head of the family; he was the master over his wife, his children, the wives of his sons, the nephews, the slaves and the freedmen, disposing of them and of their goods at will, even putting them to death. Roman law recognised only patrician families as legal entities. Slavery and slaves were part of the social order; there were slave markets where they could be bought and sold. Many slaves were freed by the masters for services rendered; some slaves could save money to buy their freedom. Generally, mutilation and murder of slaves was prohibited by legislation. It is estimated that over 25% of the Roman population was enslaved. Clothing and dining\nMen typically wore a toga, and women a stola. The woman's stola looked different than a toga, and was usually brightly coloured. The cloth and the dress distinguished one class of people from the other class. The tunic worn by plebeians, or common people, like shepherds and slaves, was made from coarse and dark material, whereas the tunic worn by patricians was of linen or white wool. A knight or magistrate would wear an augusticlavus, a tunic bearing small purple studs. Senators wore tunics with broad red stripes, called tunica laticlavia. Military tunics were shorter than the ones worn by civilians. Boys, up until the festival of Liberalia, wore the toga praetexta, which was a toga with a crimson or purple border. The toga virilis, (or toga pura) was worn by men over the age of 16 to signify their citizenship in Rome. The toga picta was worn by triumphant generals and had embroidery of their skill on the battlefield. The toga pulla was worn when in mourning. Even footwear indicated a person's social status. Patricians wore red and orange sandals, senators had brown footwear, consuls had white shoes, and soldiers wore heavy boots. The Romans also invented socks for those soldiers required to fight on the northern frontiers, sometimes worn in sandals. Romans had simple food habits.\n\nIn a discussion of any ancient music, however, non-specialists and even many musicians have to be reminded that much of what makes our modern music familiar to us is the result of developments only within the last 1,000 years; thus, our ideas of melody, scales, harmony, and even the instruments we use would not be familiar to Romans who made and listened to music many centuries earlier. Over time, Roman architecture was modified as their urban requirements changed, and the civil engineering and building construction technology became developed and refined. The Roman concrete has remained a riddle, and even after more than 2,000 years some Roman structures still stand magnificently. The architectural style of the capitol city was emulated by other urban centers under Roman control and influence. Roman cities were well planned, efficiently managed and neatly maintained. Sports and entertainment\nThe city of Rome had a place called the Campus Martius (\"Field of Mars\"), which was a sort of drill ground for Roman soldiers. Later, the Campus became Rome's track and field playground. In the campus, the youth assembled to play and exercise, which included jumping, wrestling, boxing and racing. Equestrian sports, throwing, and swimming were also preferred physical activities. In the countryside, pastime included fishing and hunting. Board games played in Rome included dice (Tesserae or Tali), Roman Chess (Latrunculi), Roman Checkers (Calculi), Tic-tac-toe (Terni Lapilli), and Ludus duodecim scriptorum and Tabula, predecessors of backgammon. There were several other activities to keep people engaged like chariot races, musical and theatrical performances. Roman religious beliefs date back to the founding of Rome, around 800 BC. However, the Roman religion commonly associated with the republic and early empire did not begin until around 500 BC, when Romans came in contact with Greek culture, and adopted many of the Greek religious beliefs. Private and personal worship was an important aspect of religious practices. In a sense, each household was a temple to the gods. Each household had an altar (lararium), at which the family members would offer prayers, perform rites, and interact with the household gods. Many of the gods that Romans worshiped came from the Proto-Indo-European pantheon, others were based on Greek gods. The two most famous deities were Jupiter (the king God) and Mars (the god of war). With its cultural influence spreading over most of the Mediterranean, Romans began accepting foreign gods into their own culture, as well as other philosophical traditions such as Cynicism and Stoicism. This article is part of the series on:\nMilitary of ancient Rome (portal)\n753 BC – AD 476\nStructural history Roman army (unit types and ranks, legions, auxiliaries, generals) Roman navy (fleets, admirals) Campaign history Lists of wars and battles Decorations and punishments Technological history Military engineering (castra, siege engines, arches, roads) Political history Strategy and tactics Infantry tactics Frontiers and fortifications (limes, Hadrian's Wall)\nThe structural history of the Roman military describes the major chronological transformations in the organisation and constitution of the Roman armed forces. The Roman military was split into the Roman army and the Roman navy, although these two branches were less distinct than they tend to be in modern defence forces. Within the top-level branches of army and navy, structural changes occurred both as a result of positive military reform and through organic structural evolution. Hoplite armies (509–c. 315 BC)\nDuring this period, Roman soldiers seem to have been modelled after those of the Etruscans to the north, who themselves seem to have copied their style of warfare from the Greeks. Traditionally, the introduction of the phalanx formation into the Roman army is ascribed to the city's penultimate king, Servius Tullius (ruled 578 to 534 BC). According to Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the front rank was composed of the wealthiest citizens, who were able to purchase the best equipment. Each subsequent rank consisted of those with less wealth and poorer equipment than the one before it.\n\nThe chapter concludes with a brief but interesting review of recruitment, training and promotion--with an almost exclusively imperial focus. The fourth chapter, \"The Culture of the Roman Army,\" continues the handbook style\/format. Following a brief section on \"physiognomy,\" by which Southern seems to mean the provenance of the recruits, we read of matters of morale, discipline, and traditions. Southern notes the privileged legal status of soldiers but notes as well that military discipline was apparently enforced with less rigor in the Empire than in the Republic and also less so in peacetime than in war. Punishments ranged from extra duty to loss of rank or pay to discharge and finally execution. Southern notes as well that soldiers were not entitled to leave or furlough but could apparently arrange privately with their commanders to be absent (literally at their own expense) from camp and the duty roster. The section on traditions explores unit names, decorations and medals, uniforms (from helmets to socks over several pages), military music, and holidays. The last include the specially \"military festivals\" of the Quinquatria on 19 March and the feast of Vesta on 9 June as well as the emperor's birthday and 21 April, the anniversary of the founding of the city. A section on veterans concludes the chapter; Southern explains the military diploma, the privileges and obligations, the state funded, one time, cash pensions of the retirees, and finally the exemptions from some taxes. Chapter five examines the subject of \"The Roman Army at War.\" Southern opens with the traditional claim that \"From their earliest beginnings to the late empire, the Romans consistently adopted a warlike disposition\"(171). That said, however, she believes that the Empire lacked a strategic plan: Romans tended to behave reactively in going to war and pragmatically in settling a conflict. Reflecting the defensive posture employed over much of imperial history, Southern devotes several pages (178-186) to frontiers and forts (with perhaps the book's most useful illustrations--diagrams of the Wallsend and Housestead forts on Hadrian's Wall). Under tactics and operational concepts are grouped the order of march (with examples taken from Polybius, Josephus and Arrian), marching and temporary camps, and battle. The chapter examines as well planning and staff work, command and control (including the difficult balance of aggression and diffidence that troubled imperial commanders like Corbulo and Agricola), and operations involving combined naval and ground forces. Rather unusually for this book but doubtlessly reflecting the sources, almost all of the information about the last dates from the Republic rather than the Empire. \"The Tools of War\" occupy chapter six, though in addition to weaponry Southern examines logistics, communications, medicine, technology and cartography. The weapons discussed include gladius, pilum, lancea, spatha, pugio, bows and arrows, artillery, and slingshots. Here more than anywhere else a selection of drawings or photographs would have been immensely helpful. While Southern does provide references to other authors, I would have traded several of the book's illustrations taken from the Library of Congress for genuine \"hardware\" here. In discussing logistics Southern points to the obvious differences between Republic and Empire when permanent forts and bases were the rule. Over several pages Southern discusses food and fodder requirements, the number of pack animals employed by a legion on the move, and the speed of transport\/march. Of intelligence and communications Southern suggests that they worked much better on the local than the regional or imperial level; and so, as the frontiers became increasingly troublesome, emperors necessarily moved from Rome to where their presence was required. The discussion of medicine is brief, though Southern does demonstrate that the Romans made significant advances in the treatment of wounds and outbreaks of disease\/illness in camp. Equally brief are the sections on technology and cartography, the former effectively equated with engineering and the latter with itineraries; again references indicate possibilities for more detailed study. Chapter seven, \"The Late Roman Army,\" returns to more traditional, historical narrative in the book's shortest chapter; here Southern provides a dramatically abridged but updated version of her 1996 work of the same title. The central issues are the adjustments, reforms, and innovations occasioned by \". .\n\nThe importance of ancient roman society\nAncient greek art emphasized the importance and of all things greek and roman browse around this page for anything about art and architecture.

Finally, newly recruited soldiers were taught to use weapons. Exercises, however, were carried out using wooden and wicker swords or shields that were heavier than a real weapon. In this way, the legionary was acquainted with the fatigue and exhaustion that could appear on the battlefield. IV. Length of service and pay\nEmperor Octavian August finally determined the length of the legionary’s service in 16 BCE as 16 years. After this period, it was expected that the hardened soldier would join the vexillum veteranorum or veteran unit for four consecutive years. In 6 CE the service was extended to 20 years and the so-called praemia militare, which is a form of retirement pension paid to veterans in the amount of 12,000 sesterces (3,000 denarii). Over time, veterans received land instead of money. In the middle of the first century CE the service was finally 25 years old. However, all military reports were less and less followed, and some legionaries could boast of 30 or even 40 years of military service. In addition to payment (after serving more years), praemia militare legionaries received a pay of 900 sesteria per year (paid in three tranches). Wages remained constant until around 80 CE, despite rising inflation. Naturally, however, the pay varied depending on the rank – specialists, e.g., received 1.5, 2 or 2 times more pay. V. Temptation of loot and plunder\nWhat often encouraged young people to join the army was the prospect of gaining great spoils during the war campaigns. Leaders wanting to gain the support of their soldiers allowed for plunder and robbery in the captured cities. There were rules regarding plundering in the Roman army. When the city was stormed, all the spoils were divided among legionaries. If the city surrendered itself, the senior officers decided about the distribution of loot. The fact that the allocation of loot was an important element for the integrity of the Roman army is testified by the account of Livius, who mentioned the rebellion of the army stationed under Sukron (in Spain) in 206 BCE According to an ancient historian, the decline in soldier’s discipline took place there, among others, “because they were used to living from quite abundant spoils gained on the enemy” . In the case of conquering a hostile city, the Romans quite often carried out not only his plunder, but also murders of the population inhabiting them. The acts of crime on the civilian population of the captured city were carried out in two ways: by order of the main commander or on his own responsibility. In Roman war doctrine, however, it was not accepted that Roman people, especially women and their virtue, would suffer. During the civil war in Spain, Roman commander Sertorius (1st century BCE) ordered the loss of the entire 500 people cohort. He did it because one of the soldiers of this unit tried to rape a Roman citizen. In addition to discipline and training, brotherhood had a great impact on the quality of the Roman army. Roman Centuria with 80 people, was divided into 10 contubernium, of 8 soldiers. They shared a tent, spent their free days, marched, practiced and fought. They were brothers in arms and often undertook to contact the family of a fallen companion. VII. Cowardice was severly punished\nThe word decimation nowadays usually means destruction of the environment, population or ecosystem. In Roman times, the term was used to describe the punishment that Roman generals used on their disobedient troops to discipline them properly.\n\nIn addition, the shortage of available manpower led to a greater burden being placed upon Rome's allies for the provision of allied troops. Eventually, the Romans were forced to begin hiring mercenaries to fight alongside the legions. The legion after the reforms of Gaius Marius (107–27 BC)\nIn a process known as the Marian reforms, Roman consul Gaius Marius carried out a programme of reform of the Roman military. In 107 BC, all citizens, regardless of their wealth or social class, were made eligible for entry into the Roman army. This move formalised and concluded a gradual process that had been growing for centuries, of removing property requirements for military service. The distinction between the three heavy infantry classes, which had already become blurred, had collapsed into a single class of heavy legionary infantry. The heavy infantry legionaries were drawn from citizen stock, while non-citizens came to dominate the ranks of the light infantry. The army's higher-level officers and commanders were still drawn exclusively from the Roman aristocracy. Unlike earlier in the Republic, legionaries were no longer fighting on a seasonal basis to protect their land. Instead, they received standard pay, and were employed by the state on a fixed-term basis. As a consequence, military duty began to appeal most to the poorest sections of society, to whom a salaried pay was attractive. A destabilising consequence of this development was that the proletariat \"acquired a stronger and more elevated position\" within the state. The legions of the late Republic were, structurally, almost entirely heavy infantry. The legion's main sub-unit was called a cohort and consisted of approximately 480 infantrymen. The cohort was therefore a much larger unit than the earlier maniple sub-unit, and was divided into six centuries of 80 men each. Each century was separated further into 10 \"tent groups\" of 8 men each. Legions additionally consisted of a small body, typically 120 men, of Roman legionary cavalry. The cavalry troops were used as scouts and dispatch riders rather than battlefield cavalry. Legions also contained a dedicated group of artillery crew of perhaps 60 men. Each legion was normally partnered with an approximately equal number of allied (non-Roman) troops. However, the most obvious deficiency of the Roman army remained its shortage of cavalry, especially heavy cavalry. As Rome's borders expanded and its adversaries changed from largely infantry-based to largely cavalry-based troops, the infantry-based Roman army began to find itself at a tactical disadvantage, particularly in the East. After having declined in size following the subjugation of the Mediterranean, the Roman navy underwent short-term upgrading and revitalisation in the late Republic to meet several new demands. Under Caesar, an invasion fleet was assembled in the English Channel to allow the invasion of Britannia; under Pompey, a large fleet was raised in the Mediterranean Sea to clear the sea of Cilician pirates. During the civil war that followed, as many as a thousand ships were either constructed or pressed into service from Greek cities. The core of the campaign history of the Roman Republican military is the account of the Roman military's land battles. Despite the encompassing of lands around the periphery of the Mediterranean sea, naval battles were typically less significant than land battles to the military history of Rome. As with most ancient civilisations, Rome's military served the triple purposes of securing its borders, exploiting peripheral areas through measures such as imposing tribute on conquered peoples, and maintaining internal order. From the outset, Rome's military typified this pattern and the majority of Rome's campaigns were characterised by one of two types. The first is the territorial expansionist campaign, normally begun as a counter-offensive, in which each victory brought subjugation of large areas of territory. The second is the civil war, of which examples plagued the Roman Republic in its final century. Roman armies were not invincible, despite their formidable reputation and host of victories. Over the centuries the Romans \"produced their share of incompetents\" who led Roman armies into catastrophic defeats.\n\nIn fact, the legions of early Rome were conscripted only as part-time soldiers and had their main occupation as farmers and herders. This stringent economic system prevented them from taking part in extended campaigns (that hardly went beyond a month), thus keeping military actions short and decisive. Moreover, these legions had to pay for their own arms and armaments – which at times was compensated only by a small payment from the state. The Ancient Roman Infantry, circa late 6th century BC – early 4th century BC\nThe popular notion of the Roman army fighting in maniples is a correct one if only perceived during the later years after 4th century BC. However, in the preceding centuries, the Roman military system was inspired by its more-advanced neighbor (and enemy) – the Etruscans. In fact, the hoplite tactics of mass formation of men fighting with their shield and spear were already adopted by the Greeks by 675 BC and reached the Italy-based Etruscans by early 7th century BC. The Romans, in turn, were influenced by their Etruscan foes, and thus managed to adopt many of the rigid Greek-inspired formations along with their arms. As per historical tradition, the very adoption of the hoplite tactics was fueled by the sweeping military reforms undertaken by the penultimate Roman ruler Servius Tullius, who probably reigned in 6th century BC. He made a departure from the ‘tribal’ institutions of curia and gentes, and instead divided the military based on the individual soldier’s possession of the property. In that regard, the Roman army and its mirroring peace-time society were segregated into classes (classis). According to Livy, there were six such classes – all based on their possession of wealth (that was defined by asses or small copper coins). The first three classes fought as the traditional hoplites, armed with spears and shields – with the armaments possibly matching their economic statuses. The fourth class was only armed with spears and javelins, while the fifth class was scantily armed with slings. Finally, the six (and poorest) class was totally exempt from military service. This system once again alludes to how the early Roman army was formed on truly nationalistic values. Simply put, these men left their homes and went to war to protect (or increase) their own lands and wealth, as opposed to opting for just a ‘career’. The Ancient Roman Infantry, circa late 4th century BC –\nThe greatest strength of the Roman army had always been its adaptability and penchant for evolution. Like we mentioned before how the early Romans from their kingdom era adopted the hoplite tactics of their foes and defeated them in turn. However, by the time of the first Samnite War (in around 343 BC), the Roman army seemed to have endorsed newer formations that were more flexible in nature. This change in battlefield stratagem was probably in response to the Samnite armies – and as a result, the maniple formations came into existence (instead of the earlier rigid phalanx). The very term manipulus means ‘a handful’, and thus its early standard pertained to a pole with a handful of hay placed around it. According to most literary pieces of evidence, the Roman army was now divided up into three separate battle-lines, with the first line comprising the young hastati in ten maniples (each of 120 men); the second line comprising the hardened principes in ten maniples; and the third and last line consisting of the veteran triarii in ten maniples – who probably fought as heavy hoplites (but their maniples had only 60 men). Additionally, these battle-lines were also possibly screened by the light-armed velites, who mostly belonged to the poorer class of Roman civilians. Now if we go back to Livy’s description of the classis, we can certainly draw similarities between the economic classes and their corresponding statuses within the manipular system. For example, the primary three classes were now divided into the main fighting arm – and they comprised the hastati (the young and relatively poor); the principes (the experienced and belonging to the middle class); and the triarii (the veterans and relatively well-off citizens).\n\nLe Bohec calls for more detailed studies on the ranks of the army (Chapter 6, pp. 95-117). At the higher levels of responsibilty one can trace the military careers (p. 102 for a summary chart). St. Jerome’s use of military terminology assists in the reconstruction of lesser ranks (tables on pp. 103, 105) and Le Bohec finds continuities with terminology from Republican times. Military service itself was characterized by the increased performance of policing activities. Military building activity (Chapter 7, pp. 118-130) is a field in motion for Le Bohec, one marked by new excavations and new assessments of the already known data (site list on pp. 129-130). He cautions that one must abandon ideas of a ‘tetrarchische’ camp plan and notes that individual fortifications themselves seem to decrease in square area (Abb. 48 and p. 125). The next two chapters (Chapter 8, pp. 131-151; Chapter 9, pp. 152-170) discuss various aspects of the army’s tactics. Le Bohec removes the erroneous perception of the ‘soldier-farmer’ constantly tending crops (pp. 141 ff); supplies were made available by the state and private contractors with only limited interruptions in success (p. 146). Soldiers relied increasingly on artillery (missilia, tela), in addition to their swords and lances, although it proves difficult to match found objects with the terminology in literary sources (p. 134). Military diplomacy requires a more detailed study, but an increased interest on the part of the emperor in receiving all information-gathering reports is noted. As regards actual battle, the literary sources reflect that for most Romans military matters were an unknown quantity. No detailed portrait of a specific enemy normally was presented by ancient authors and Le Bohec argues against the selective rehabilitation of individual peoples, a practice known only this century and the end of the last (pp. 157-158). Overall, the army displayed a flexibility in battle tactics, which were adapted to deal with the enemy at hand and placed importance upon Pioneerarbeit. Chapters 10 (pp. 171-184), 11 (pp. 185-22), and 12 (pp. 201-212) discuss the various aspects of strategy. Le Bohec begins by dispelling misconceptions (pp. 171-173). By investigating the ancients’ use of strategic terminology (pp. 174-177) one discovers many continuities with earlier Roman practices, particularly those of the early empire. Le Bohec sets aside the view of a ‘bewegliche Armee”. Often it is difficult to distinguish between pure fortifications, cities in which soldiers were stationed, and cities proper (p. 181). The viae militares were not military in nature. Rather the term denotes a road of greater breadth (pp.183-184). The different theaters of action are surveyed in Chapters 11 and 12, with cautious reporting about the state of our knowledge and recent scholarship. Contact between military and civilians is the topic for Chapter 13 (pp. 218-228), the soldier’s life seen as ‘ein verzerrtes Bild der Zivilgesellschaft”, a somewhat altered model drawn from the structure of civil society (p. 213). Without soldiers the Empire would have proved ungovernable, hence the importance placed on the Emperor’s verbal communications and appearances before the troops, the adlocutio, and the more ornate adventus. Some gatherings are illustrated, but pose difficulties in interpretation (p. 215 and Abb. 16). Setting aside the illusory ‘soldier-farmer’, Le Bohec discusses the various forms of payment to the military and their economic impact (p. 223 for flow chart). The Roman army, like society, gradually Christianized, the first Christians present in the force as early as 200 AD. Chapters 14 (pp. 229-242) and 15 (pp. 243-260) return to a chronological narrative. The years 364-378 represent a worsening of the military situation, but Le Bohec cautions that the Voelkerwanderung was a slower process than often perceived.\n\nFor a five-hundred-year period beginning in 100 b.c. With Marius’s and Sulla’s defeat of the massive tribal invasions of the Mediterranean world by the Teutons and the Cimbri, the Romans ruled the northern frontier of their world, an empire that stretched across europe from the mouth of the Rhine to that of the Danube. On the other side of the Rhine lay fierce warrior tribes, which from time to time posed serious threats to the empire’s security. Yet for all their fierceness, the tribes were consistently defeated by Rome’s legions. There were military defeats, of course, such as the massacre of Teutoburger Wald, but from the crushing of the Teutons and the Cimbri, the Romans enjoyed an astonishing record of destroying the armed mobs that characterized the German approach to war. From the rise of Octavian Caesar, later titled Augustus, to supremacy over the Roman world in 32 B.C. with his defeat of Mark Antony, a professional army of between twenty-five and thirty-three legions (approximately 150,000 legionnaires and 150,000 auxiliaries) defended the empire from Hadrian’s Wall in northern Britain to the upper Nile and from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Euphrates River in Syria. This indeed was an extraordinary example of economy of force. What explains this stunning military effectiveness? Above all, Roman military effectiveness depended on the discipline and training of the legionnaires, the hallmark of a professional military organization in the modern sense. Flavius Josephus, the great historian of the Roman-Jewish War of A.D. 66–70, described the Roman training regimen in the following terms:\nAnd indeed, if anyone does but attend to the other parts of [Roman] military discipline, he will be forced to confess, that their obtaining so large a dominion hath been the acquisition of their valor, and not the bare gift of fortune: for they do not begin to use their weapons first in time of war, nor do they put their hands first into motion, having been idle in times of peace; but as if their weapons were part of themselves, they never have any truce with warlike exercises; nor do they stay till times of war admonish them to use them; for their military exercises by no means fall short of the tension of real warfare, but every soldier is every day exercised, and that with real diligence, as if they were in time of war, which is why they bear the fatigue of battle so easily; … nor would he be mistaken [who] would call their exercises unbloody battles, and their battles bloody exercises. In short, the Roman army with its legions and auxiliaries was the first true professional army in history, one that relied in battle on its discipline and training rather than on the psychological glue of culture and familial and social relations. In other words, it trained as it fought. The resulting superiority allowed the Romans to dominate their world for two and a half centuries. But things fell apart in the first half of the third century. Unfortunately for historians, there are few written records for this crucial period. Between 31 B.C. and A.D. 211, excluding emperors killed in the two major civil wars, ten emperors died of natural causes and only three were assassinated by their officers or soldiers. However, in the forty-year period between A.D. 235 and 275, only one emperor died of natural causes, while no fewer than ten were assassinated by their officers or killed by barbarians, the majority via the former mode. In effect, the armies and ambitious generals tore the empire apart, while great barbarian invasions ravaged much of its territory. The problem was that of legitimacy in the transition from one emperor to the next. The great Roman historian Tacitus had suggested that the root cause of the civil war of A.D. 69–70, the year of the four emperors, was that the legions had discovered the secret of empire—namely, that they could choose the emperor.\n\nThe Brooklyn Museum’s “Killer Heels: The Art of the High-Heeled Shoe” exhibition explores the origins of high heels worn by women and men across the world since ancient times. Meanwhile, a book that was recently published under the title “Killer Heels” follows the story of high-heeled shoes through various essays and illustrations throughout history, from ancient Greece until modern times. In ancient Greece, platform sandals called “kothorni” were shoes with high wooden cork soles, worn by actors in order to differentiate the social classes and importance of each character during the play. Later, in ancient Rome, high heels were used to identify prostitutes to potential clients, therefore, high heels became associated with prostitution. In the Middle East around 1300 BC, people would wear high heels made from wood in the bath so that they would not slip on the wet floor. These wooden platform shoes were called Kabkabs, due to the sound they made when they hit the floor. During the Middle Ages, both men and women wore “pattens,” wooden soles attached to their shoes in order to keep their fragile and expensive footwear away from street mud. “Chopines,” another form of platform shoes, became popular in Turkey and throughout Europe around the 1400s until the mid-1600s. The shoes were often higher than 30 inches and women who wore them usually used canes or servants to assist them in walking.","passages":[{"passage":"gymnasiums, and many taverns, baths and brothels. Throughout the territory under Rome's control, residential architecture ranged from very modest houses to country villas, and in the capital city of Rome, to the residences on the elegant Palatine Hill, from which the word \"palace\" is derived. The vast majority of the population lived in the city center, packed into apartment blocks. Most Roman towns and cities had a forum and temples, as did the city of Rome itself. Aqueducts were built to bring water to urban centers and wine and cooking oil were imported from abroad. Landlords generally resided in cities and their estates were left in the care of farm managers. To stimulate a higher labour productivity, many landlords freed large numbers of slaves. Beginning in the middle of the 2nd century BC, Greek culture was increasingly ascendant, in spite of tirades against the \"softening\" effects of Hellenised culture. By the time of Augustus, cultured Greek household slaves taught the Roman young (sometimes even the girls). Greek sculptures adorned Hellenistic landscape gardening on the Palatine or in the villas, and much Roman cuisine was essentially Greek. Roman writers disdained Latin for a cultured Greek style. Social history and structure\nMany aspects of Roman culture were borrowed from the Greeks. In architecture and sculpture, the difference between Greek models and Roman paintings are apparent. The chief Roman contributions to architecture were the arch and the dome. Rome has also had a tremendous impact on European cultures following it. Its significance is perhaps best reflected in its endurance and influence, as is seen in the longevity and lasting importance of works of Virgil and Ovid. Latin, the Republic's primary language, remains used for liturgical purposes by the Roman Catholic Church, and up to the 19th century was used extensively in scholarly writings in, for example, science and mathematics. Roman law laid the foundations for the laws of many European countries and their colonies. The center of the early social structure was the family, which was not only marked by blood relations but also by the legally constructed relation of patria potestas. The Pater familias was the absolute head of the family; he was the master over his wife, his children, the wives of his sons, the nephews, the slaves and the freedmen, disposing of them and of their goods at will, even putting them to death. Roman law recognised only patrician families as legal entities. Slavery and slaves were part of the social order; there were slave markets where they could be bought and sold. Many slaves were freed by the masters for services rendered; some slaves could save money to buy their freedom. Generally, mutilation and murder of slaves was prohibited by legislation. It is estimated that over 25% of the Roman population was enslaved. Clothing and dining\nMen typically wore a toga, and women a stola. The woman's stola looked different than a toga, and was usually brightly coloured. The cloth and the dress distinguished one class of people from the other class. The tunic worn by plebeians, or common people, like shepherds and slaves, was made from coarse and dark material, whereas the tunic worn by patricians was of linen or white wool. A knight or magistrate would wear an augusticlavus, a tunic bearing small purple studs. Senators wore tunics with broad red stripes, called tunica laticlavia. Military tunics were shorter than the ones worn by civilians. Boys, up until the festival of Liberalia, wore the toga praetexta, which was a toga with a crimson or purple border. The toga virilis, (or toga pura) was worn by men over the age of 16 to signify their citizenship in Rome. The toga picta was worn by triumphant generals and had embroidery of their skill on the battlefield. The toga pulla was worn when in mourning. Even footwear indicated a person's social status. Patricians wore red and orange sandals, senators had brown footwear, consuls had white shoes, and soldiers wore heavy boots. The Romans also invented socks for those soldiers required to fight on the northern frontiers, sometimes worn in sandals. Romans had simple food habits.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:dd83c13a-60ed-4da4-94a6-5d461eaafec6>"]},{"passage":"In a discussion of any ancient music, however, non-specialists and even many musicians have to be reminded that much of what makes our modern music familiar to us is the result of developments only within the last 1,000 years; thus, our ideas of melody, scales, harmony, and even the instruments we use would not be familiar to Romans who made and listened to music many centuries earlier. Over time, Roman architecture was modified as their urban requirements changed, and the civil engineering and building construction technology became developed and refined. The Roman concrete has remained a riddle, and even after more than 2,000 years some Roman structures still stand magnificently. The architectural style of the capitol city was emulated by other urban centers under Roman control and influence. Roman cities were well planned, efficiently managed and neatly maintained. Sports and entertainment\nThe city of Rome had a place called the Campus Martius (\"Field of Mars\"), which was a sort of drill ground for Roman soldiers. Later, the Campus became Rome's track and field playground. In the campus, the youth assembled to play and exercise, which included jumping, wrestling, boxing and racing. Equestrian sports, throwing, and swimming were also preferred physical activities. In the countryside, pastime included fishing and hunting. Board games played in Rome included dice (Tesserae or Tali), Roman Chess (Latrunculi), Roman Checkers (Calculi), Tic-tac-toe (Terni Lapilli), and Ludus duodecim scriptorum and Tabula, predecessors of backgammon. There were several other activities to keep people engaged like chariot races, musical and theatrical performances. Roman religious beliefs date back to the founding of Rome, around 800 BC. However, the Roman religion commonly associated with the republic and early empire did not begin until around 500 BC, when Romans came in contact with Greek culture, and adopted many of the Greek religious beliefs. Private and personal worship was an important aspect of religious practices. In a sense, each household was a temple to the gods. Each household had an altar (lararium), at which the family members would offer prayers, perform rites, and interact with the household gods. Many of the gods that Romans worshiped came from the Proto-Indo-European pantheon, others were based on Greek gods. The two most famous deities were Jupiter (the king God) and Mars (the god of war). With its cultural influence spreading over most of the Mediterranean, Romans began accepting foreign gods into their own culture, as well as other philosophical traditions such as Cynicism and Stoicism.

The Roman military was split into the Roman army and the Roman navy, although these two branches were less distinct than they tend to be in modern defence forces. Within the top-level branches of army and navy, structural changes occurred both as a result of positive military reform and through organic structural evolution. Hoplite armies (509–c. 315 BC)\nDuring this period, Roman soldiers seem to have been modelled after those of the Etruscans to the north, who themselves seem to have copied their style of warfare from the Greeks. Traditionally, the introduction of the phalanx formation into the Roman army is ascribed to the city's penultimate king, Servius Tullius (ruled 578 to 534 BC). According to Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the front rank was composed of the wealthiest citizens, who were able to purchase the best equipment. Each subsequent rank consisted of those with less wealth and poorer equipment than the one before it.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:dd83c13a-60ed-4da4-94a6-5d461eaafec6>"]},{"passage":"The chapter concludes with a brief but interesting review of recruitment, training and promotion--with an almost exclusively imperial focus. The fourth chapter, \"The Culture of the Roman Army,\" continues the handbook style\/format. Following a brief section on \"physiognomy,\" by which Southern seems to mean the provenance of the recruits, we read of matters of morale, discipline, and traditions. Southern notes the privileged legal status of soldiers but notes as well that military discipline was apparently enforced with less rigor in the Empire than in the Republic and also less so in peacetime than in war. Punishments ranged from extra duty to loss of rank or pay to discharge and finally execution. Southern notes as well that soldiers were not entitled to leave or furlough but could apparently arrange privately with their commanders to be absent (literally at their own expense) from camp and the duty roster. The section on traditions explores unit names, decorations and medals, uniforms (from helmets to socks over several pages), military music, and holidays. The last include the specially \"military festivals\" of the Quinquatria on 19 March and the feast of Vesta on 9 June as well as the emperor's birthday and 21 April, the anniversary of the founding of the city. A section on veterans concludes the chapter; Southern explains the military diploma, the privileges and obligations, the state funded, one time, cash pensions of the retirees, and finally the exemptions from some taxes. Chapter five examines the subject of \"The Roman Army at War.\" Southern opens with the traditional claim that \"From their earliest beginnings to the late empire, the Romans consistently adopted a warlike disposition\"(171). That said, however, she believes that the Empire lacked a strategic plan: Romans tended to behave reactively in going to war and pragmatically in settling a conflict. Reflecting the defensive posture employed over much of imperial history, Southern devotes several pages (178-186) to frontiers and forts (with perhaps the book's most useful illustrations--diagrams of the Wallsend and Housestead forts on Hadrian's Wall). Under tactics and operational concepts are grouped the order of march (with examples taken from Polybius, Josephus and Arrian), marching and temporary camps, and battle. The chapter examines as well planning and staff work, command and control (including the difficult balance of aggression and diffidence that troubled imperial commanders like Corbulo and Agricola), and operations involving combined naval and ground forces. Rather unusually for this book but doubtlessly reflecting the sources, almost all of the information about the last dates from the Republic rather than the Empire. \"The Tools of War\" occupy chapter six, though in addition to weaponry Southern examines logistics, communications, medicine, technology and cartography. The weapons discussed include gladius, pilum, lancea, spatha, pugio, bows and arrows, artillery, and slingshots. Here more than anywhere else a selection of drawings or photographs would have been immensely helpful. While Southern does provide references to other authors, I would have traded several of the book's illustrations taken from the Library of Congress for genuine \"hardware\" here. In discussing logistics Southern points to the obvious differences between Republic and Empire when permanent forts and bases were the rule. Over several pages Southern discusses food and fodder requirements, the number of pack animals employed by a legion on the move, and the speed of transport\/march. Of intelligence and communications Southern suggests that they worked much better on the local than the regional or imperial level; and so, as the frontiers became increasingly troublesome, emperors necessarily moved from Rome to where their presence was required. The discussion of medicine is brief, though Southern does demonstrate that the Romans made significant advances in the treatment of wounds and outbreaks of disease\/illness in camp. Equally brief are the sections on technology and cartography, the former effectively equated with engineering and the latter with itineraries; again references indicate possibilities for more detailed study. Chapter seven, \"The Late Roman Army,\" returns to more traditional, historical narrative in the book's shortest chapter; here Southern provides a dramatically abridged but updated version of her 1996 work of the same title.

Finally, newly recruited soldiers were taught to use weapons. Exercises, however, were carried out using wooden and wicker swords or shields that were heavier than a real weapon. In this way, the legionary was acquainted with the fatigue and exhaustion that could appear on the battlefield. IV. Length of service and pay\nEmperor Octavian August finally determined the length of the legionary’s service in 16 BCE as 16 years. After this period, it was expected that the hardened soldier would join the vexillum veteranorum or veteran unit for four consecutive years. In 6 CE the service was extended to 20 years and the so-called praemia militare, which is a form of retirement pension paid to veterans in the amount of 12,000 sesterces (3,000 denarii). Over time, veterans received land instead of money. In the middle of the first century CE the service was finally 25 years old. However, all military reports were less and less followed, and some legionaries could boast of 30 or even 40 years of military service. In addition to payment (after serving more years), praemia militare legionaries received a pay of 900 sesteria per year (paid in three tranches). Wages remained constant until around 80 CE, despite rising inflation. Naturally, however, the pay varied depending on the rank – specialists, e.g., received 1.5, 2 or 2 times more pay. V. Temptation of loot and plunder\nWhat often encouraged young people to join the army was the prospect of gaining great spoils during the war campaigns. Leaders wanting to gain the support of their soldiers allowed for plunder and robbery in the captured cities. There were rules regarding plundering in the Roman army. When the city was stormed, all the spoils were divided among legionaries. If the city surrendered itself, the senior officers decided about the distribution of loot. The fact that the allocation of loot was an important element for the integrity of the Roman army is testified by the account of Livius, who mentioned the rebellion of the army stationed under Sukron (in Spain) in 206 BCE According to an ancient historian, the decline in soldier’s discipline took place there, among others, “because they were used to living from quite abundant spoils gained on the enemy” . In the case of conquering a hostile city, the Romans quite often carried out not only his plunder, but also murders of the population inhabiting them. The acts of crime on the civilian population of the captured city were carried out in two ways: by order of the main commander or on his own responsibility. In Roman war doctrine, however, it was not accepted that Roman people, especially women and their virtue, would suffer. During the civil war in Spain, Roman commander Sertorius (1st century BCE) ordered the loss of the entire 500 people cohort. He did it because one of the soldiers of this unit tried to rape a Roman citizen. In addition to discipline and training, brotherhood had a great impact on the quality of the Roman army. Roman Centuria with 80 people, was divided into 10 contubernium, of 8 soldiers. They shared a tent, spent their free days, marched, practiced and fought. They were brothers in arms and often undertook to contact the family of a fallen companion. VII. Cowardice was severly punished\nThe word decimation nowadays usually means destruction of the environment, population or ecosystem. In Roman times, the term was used to describe the punishment that Roman generals used on their disobedient troops to discipline them properly.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:a35aeac9-f54b-48e4-94a9-c499f1fc5903>"]},{"passage":"In addition, the shortage of available manpower led to a greater burden being placed upon Rome's allies for the provision of allied troops. Eventually, the Romans were forced to begin hiring mercenaries to fight alongside the legions. The legion after the reforms of Gaius Marius (107–27 BC)\nIn a process known as the Marian reforms, Roman consul Gaius Marius carried out a programme of reform of the Roman military. In 107 BC, all citizens, regardless of their wealth or social class, were made eligible for entry into the Roman army. This move formalised and concluded a gradual process that had been growing for centuries, of removing property requirements for military service. The distinction between the three heavy infantry classes, which had already become blurred, had collapsed into a single class of heavy legionary infantry. The heavy infantry legionaries were drawn from citizen stock, while non-citizens came to dominate the ranks of the light infantry. The army's higher-level officers and commanders were still drawn exclusively from the Roman aristocracy. Unlike earlier in the Republic, legionaries were no longer fighting on a seasonal basis to protect their land. Instead, they received standard pay, and were employed by the state on a fixed-term basis. As a consequence, military duty began to appeal most to the poorest sections of society, to whom a salaried pay was attractive. A destabilising consequence of this development was that the proletariat \"acquired a stronger and more elevated position\" within the state. The legions of the late Republic were, structurally, almost entirely heavy infantry. The legion's main sub-unit was called a cohort and consisted of approximately 480 infantrymen. The cohort was therefore a much larger unit than the earlier maniple sub-unit, and was divided into six centuries of 80 men each. Each century was separated further into 10 \"tent groups\" of 8 men each. Legions additionally consisted of a small body, typically 120 men, of Roman legionary cavalry. The cavalry troops were used as scouts and dispatch riders rather than battlefield cavalry. Legions also contained a dedicated group of artillery crew of perhaps 60 men. Each legion was normally partnered with an approximately equal number of allied (non-Roman) troops. However, the most obvious deficiency of the Roman army remained its shortage of cavalry, especially heavy cavalry. As Rome's borders expanded and its adversaries changed from largely infantry-based to largely cavalry-based troops, the infantry-based Roman army began to find itself at a tactical disadvantage, particularly in the East. After having declined in size following the subjugation of the Mediterranean, the Roman navy underwent short-term upgrading and revitalisation in the late Republic to meet several new demands. Under Caesar, an invasion fleet was assembled in the English Channel to allow the invasion of Britannia; under Pompey, a large fleet was raised in the Mediterranean Sea to clear the sea of Cilician pirates. During the civil war that followed, as many as a thousand ships were either constructed or pressed into service from Greek cities. The core of the campaign history of the Roman Republican military is the account of the Roman military's land battles. Despite the encompassing of lands around the periphery of the Mediterranean sea, naval battles were typically less significant than land battles to the military history of Rome. As with most ancient civilisations, Rome's military served the triple purposes of securing its borders, exploiting peripheral areas through measures such as imposing tribute on conquered peoples, and maintaining internal order. From the outset, Rome's military typified this pattern and the majority of Rome's campaigns were characterised by one of two types. The first is the territorial expansionist campaign, normally begun as a counter-offensive, in which each victory brought subjugation of large areas of territory. The second is the civil war, of which examples plagued the Roman Republic in its final century. Roman armies were not invincible, despite their formidable reputation and host of victories. Over the centuries the Romans \"produced their share of incompetents\" who led Roman armies into catastrophic defeats.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:dd83c13a-60ed-4da4-94a6-5d461eaafec6>"]},{"passage":"In fact, the legions of early Rome were conscripted only as part-time soldiers and had their main occupation as farmers and herders. This stringent economic system prevented them from taking part in extended campaigns (that hardly went beyond a month), thus keeping military actions short and decisive. Moreover, these legions had to pay for their own arms and armaments – which at times was compensated only by a small payment from the state. The Ancient Roman Infantry, circa late 6th century BC – early 4th century BC\nThe popular notion of the Roman army fighting in maniples is a correct one if only perceived during the later years after 4th century BC. However, in the preceding centuries, the Roman military system was inspired by its more-advanced neighbor (and enemy) – the Etruscans. In fact, the hoplite tactics of mass formation of men fighting with their shield and spear were already adopted by the Greeks by 675 BC and reached the Italy-based Etruscans by early 7th century BC. The Romans, in turn, were influenced by their Etruscan foes, and thus managed to adopt many of the rigid Greek-inspired formations along with their arms. As per historical tradition, the very adoption of the hoplite tactics was fueled by the sweeping military reforms undertaken by the penultimate Roman ruler Servius Tullius, who probably reigned in 6th century BC. He made a departure from the ‘tribal’ institutions of curia and gentes, and instead divided the military based on the individual soldier’s possession of the property. In that regard, the Roman army and its mirroring peace-time society were segregated into classes (classis). According to Livy, there were six such classes – all based on their possession of wealth (that was defined by asses or small copper coins). The first three classes fought as the traditional hoplites, armed with spears and shields – with the armaments possibly matching their economic statuses. The fourth class was only armed with spears and javelins, while the fifth class was scantily armed with slings. Finally, the six (and poorest) class was totally exempt from military service. This system once again alludes to how the early Roman army was formed on truly nationalistic values. Simply put, these men left their homes and went to war to protect (or increase) their own lands and wealth, as opposed to opting for just a ‘career’. The Ancient Roman Infantry, circa late 4th century BC –\nThe greatest strength of the Roman army had always been its adaptability and penchant for evolution. Like we mentioned before how the early Romans from their kingdom era adopted the hoplite tactics of their foes and defeated them in turn. However, by the time of the first Samnite War (in around 343 BC), the Roman army seemed to have endorsed newer formations that were more flexible in nature. This change in battlefield stratagem was probably in response to the Samnite armies – and as a result, the maniple formations came into existence (instead of the earlier rigid phalanx). The very term manipulus means ‘a handful’, and thus its early standard pertained to a pole with a handful of hay placed around it. According to most literary pieces of evidence, the Roman army was now divided up into three separate battle-lines, with the first line comprising the young hastati in ten maniples (each of 120 men); the second line comprising the hardened principes in ten maniples; and the third and last line consisting of the veteran triarii in ten maniples – who probably fought as heavy hoplites (but their maniples had only 60 men). Additionally, these battle-lines were also possibly screened by the light-armed velites, who mostly belonged to the poorer class of Roman civilians. Now if we go back to Livy’s description of the classis, we can certainly draw similarities between the economic classes and their corresponding statuses within the manipular system. For example, the primary three classes were now divided into the main fighting arm – and they comprised the hastati (the young and relatively poor); the principes (the experienced and belonging to the middle class); and the triarii (the veterans and relatively well-off citizens).","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:7b1790ca-1d0b-4b0a-8676-7afcb6d5e50b>"]},{"passage":"Le Bohec calls for more detailed studies on the ranks of the army (Chapter 6, pp. 95-117). At the higher levels of responsibilty one can trace the military careers (p. 102 for a summary chart). St. Jerome’s use of military terminology assists in the reconstruction of lesser ranks (tables on pp. 103, 105) and Le Bohec finds continuities with terminology from Republican times. Military service itself was characterized by the increased performance of policing activities. Military building activity (Chapter 7, pp. 118-130) is a field in motion for Le Bohec, one marked by new excavations and new assessments of the already known data (site list on pp. 129-130). He cautions that one must abandon ideas of a ‘tetrarchische’ camp plan and notes that individual fortifications themselves seem to decrease in square area (Abb. 48 and p. 125). The next two chapters (Chapter 8, pp. 131-151; Chapter 9, pp. 152-170) discuss various aspects of the army’s tactics. Le Bohec removes the erroneous perception of the ‘soldier-farmer’ constantly tending crops (pp. 141 ff); supplies were made available by the state and private contractors with only limited interruptions in success (p. 146). Soldiers relied increasingly on artillery (missilia, tela), in addition to their swords and lances, although it proves difficult to match found objects with the terminology in literary sources (p. 134). Military diplomacy requires a more detailed study, but an increased interest on the part of the emperor in receiving all information-gathering reports is noted. As regards actual battle, the literary sources reflect that for most Romans military matters were an unknown quantity. No detailed portrait of a specific enemy normally was presented by ancient authors and Le Bohec argues against the selective rehabilitation of individual peoples, a practice known only this century and the end of the last (pp. 157-158). Overall, the army displayed a flexibility in battle tactics, which were adapted to deal with the enemy at hand and placed importance upon Pioneerarbeit. Chapters 10 (pp. 171-184), 11 (pp. 185-22), and 12 (pp. 201-212) discuss the various aspects of strategy. Le Bohec begins by dispelling misconceptions (pp. 171-173). By investigating the ancients’ use of strategic terminology (pp. 174-177) one discovers many continuities with earlier Roman practices, particularly those of the early empire. Le Bohec sets aside the view of a ‘bewegliche Armee”. Often it is difficult to distinguish between pure fortifications, cities in which soldiers were stationed, and cities proper (p. 181). The viae militares were not military in nature. Rather the term denotes a road of greater breadth (pp.183-184). The different theaters of action are surveyed in Chapters 11 and 12, with cautious reporting about the state of our knowledge and recent scholarship. Contact between military and civilians is the topic for Chapter 13 (pp. 218-228), the soldier’s life seen as ‘ein verzerrtes Bild der Zivilgesellschaft”, a somewhat altered model drawn from the structure of civil society (p. 213). Without soldiers the Empire would have proved ungovernable, hence the importance placed on the Emperor’s verbal communications and appearances before the troops, the adlocutio, and the more ornate adventus. Some gatherings are illustrated, but pose difficulties in interpretation (p. 215 and Abb. 16). Setting aside the illusory ‘soldier-farmer’, Le Bohec discusses the various forms of payment to the military and their economic impact (p. 223 for flow chart). The Roman army, like society, gradually Christianized, the first Christians present in the force as early as 200 AD. Chapters 14 (pp. 229-242) and 15 (pp. 243-260) return to a chronological narrative. The years 364-378 represent a worsening of the military situation, but Le Bohec cautions that the Voelkerwanderung was a slower process than often perceived.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:32818d17-4e19-4047-b97f-5ade37102a85>"]},{"passage":"For a five-hundred-year period beginning in 100 b.c. With Marius’s and Sulla’s defeat of the massive tribal invasions of the Mediterranean world by the Teutons and the Cimbri, the Romans ruled the northern frontier of their world, an empire that stretched across europe from the mouth of the Rhine to that of the Danube. On the other side of the Rhine lay fierce warrior tribes, which from time to time posed serious threats to the empire’s security. Yet for all their fierceness, the tribes were consistently defeated by Rome’s legions. There were military defeats, of course, such as the massacre of Teutoburger Wald, but from the crushing of the Teutons and the Cimbri, the Romans enjoyed an astonishing record of destroying the armed mobs that characterized the German approach to war. From the rise of Octavian Caesar, later titled Augustus, to supremacy over the Roman world in 32 B.C. with his defeat of Mark Antony, a professional army of between twenty-five and thirty-three legions (approximately 150,000 legionnaires and 150,000 auxiliaries) defended the empire from Hadrian’s Wall in northern Britain to the upper Nile and from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Euphrates River in Syria. This indeed was an extraordinary example of economy of force. What explains this stunning military effectiveness? Above all, Roman military effectiveness depended on the discipline and training of the legionnaires, the hallmark of a professional military organization in the modern sense. Flavius Josephus, the great historian of the Roman-Jewish War of A.D. 66–70, described the Roman training regimen in the following terms:\nAnd indeed, if anyone does but attend to the other parts of [Roman] military discipline, he will be forced to confess, that their obtaining so large a dominion hath been the acquisition of their valor, and not the bare gift of fortune: for they do not begin to use their weapons first in time of war, nor do they put their hands first into motion, having been idle in times of peace; but as if their weapons were part of themselves, they never have any truce with warlike exercises; nor do they stay till times of war admonish them to use them; for their military exercises by no means fall short of the tension of real warfare, but every soldier is every day exercised, and that with real diligence, as if they were in time of war, which is why they bear the fatigue of battle so easily; … nor would he be mistaken [who] would call their exercises unbloody battles, and their battles bloody exercises. In short, the Roman army with its legions and auxiliaries was the first true professional army in history, one that relied in battle on its discipline and training rather than on the psychological glue of culture and familial and social relations. In other words, it trained as it fought. The resulting superiority allowed the Romans to dominate their world for two and a half centuries. But things fell apart in the first half of the third century. Unfortunately for historians, there are few written records for this crucial period. Between 31 B.C. and A.D. 211, excluding emperors killed in the two major civil wars, ten emperors died of natural causes and only three were assassinated by their officers or soldiers. However, in the forty-year period between A.D. 235 and 275, only one emperor died of natural causes, while no fewer than ten were assassinated by their officers or killed by barbarians, the majority via the former mode. In effect, the armies and ambitious generals tore the empire apart, while great barbarian invasions ravaged much of its territory. The problem was that of legitimacy in the transition from one emperor to the next. The great Roman historian Tacitus had suggested that the root cause of the civil war of A.D. 69–70, the year of the four emperors, was that the legions had discovered the secret of empire—namely, that they could choose the emperor.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:0d9aba3b-5482-4596-bd57-7d9e50cbe67b>"]},{"passage":"The Brooklyn Museum’s “Killer Heels: The Art of the High-Heeled Shoe” exhibition explores the origins of high heels worn by women and men across the world since ancient times. Meanwhile, a book that was recently published under the title “Killer Heels” follows the story of high-heeled shoes through various essays and illustrations throughout history, from ancient Greece until modern times. In ancient Greece, platform sandals called “kothorni” were shoes with high wooden cork soles, worn by actors in order to differentiate the social classes and importance of each character during the play. Later, in ancient Rome, high heels were used to identify prostitutes to potential clients, therefore, high heels became associated with prostitution. In the Middle East around 1300 BC, people would wear high heels made from wood in the bath so that they would not slip on the wet floor. These wooden platform shoes were called Kabkabs, due to the sound they made when they hit the floor. During the Middle Ages, both men and women wore “pattens,” wooden soles attached to their shoes in order to keep their fragile and expensive footwear away from street mud. “Chopines,” another form of platform shoes, became popular in Turkey and throughout Europe around the 1400s until the mid-1600s. The shoes were often higher than 30 inches and women who wore them usually used canes or servants to assist them in walking.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:99aadeff-65e8-4f09-a2ca-8d52192393f6>"]}]}

While there’s no strict rule as to what you should eat with your favourite red wine, especially because everyone has different palettes and preferences, there are certain reasons why wine connoisseurs make specific food and wine pairing suggestions. If you’re new to the world of developing your wine palette, that’s okay! Half the fun is understanding what notes to look for, learning what the different bodies of wine are, and what flavours best match its notes. Have you ever been sent to the liquor store with instructions to “buy red wine” but you aren’t sure what kind to get? Surely there has to be certain meanings behind each kind. We’re here to tell you that yes, each kind is completely different. Below, we’ll go over the differences (in alphabetical order) between the types of red wines so you’ll never have to feel confused about which kind to buy again. These types of grapes do well in a cooler climate, therefore, they thrive in Ontario (though they originated in France). They’re known for being very flavourful with earthy and spicy notes which is why they’re used to create drier red wines. These types of grapes thrive in both humid and cooler environments. They’re the most common type of grape that mainly come from places like Napa Valley, Australia, and the Niagara Region. They’re a little more fruity, acidic, and a deeper colour of red. If you’re looking for a unique combination, you’ll love this type of red wine that’s popularly found in Niagara. It’s often mixed with Merlot or Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and then aged in oak barrels. The oak barrels bring out the unique flavours even more and provide a more “dry” structure to the wine. This is another very popular type of grape because of its ease to mix with others and to try drinking for beginners. It’s often soft, smooth, sweet, and makes a great math for any dish or dessert. Malbec grapes are most famously known for growing in Argentina even though they originated in France. Because of these grapes being darker and thicker skinned, their sweetness and fruity flavours create a less-dry red wine. Known as one of the lighter reds, Pinot Noir wine is fruity, smoothy, and much like Merlot, it can make the perfect match for any dish or dessert. But did you know that Pinot Noir grapes are the hardest to grow? Because of their thin skin, they’re more susceptible to being damaged by temperatures or by themselves since they grow tightly together. Zinfandel is largely grown in the United States in more humid climates like Napa Valley and Lodi. It makes for a very fruity red wine but on the other hand, has subtle flavours of licorice and tobacco. It’s another wine that’s very easy to drink, making it the perfect pairing for most dishes. Note: Full, medium and light-bodied refers to the alcohol content. The fuller the body of wine, the higher alcohol content it contains (more than 13.5%). The lighter the body of wine, the lower the alcohol content (less than 12.5%). Nothing pairs together more perfectly than wine and food, especially after you’ve had a long day or you haven’t spent a night out (or in) with your friends in a long time. But how do you decide what to order with your glass of wine? Remember, the choice is completely up to you and your specific preferences, but here are the best wine and food pairings strictly based on the types of notes the red wine contains. Red meat, whether it be land, grilled steak, or burgers, make a great match for Cabernet Sauvignon. This type of full-bodied red wine has strong, deep and fruity flavours, so pairing it with equally strong meat flavours will make for a delicious dinner you won’t soon forget. The meat can also dial down the acidity and sweetness of the wine if that’s what you desire. If you’re opting for a hearty stew such as beef bourguignon, for example, Merlot is a great wine pairing to bring out the soft flavours of both the dish and the wine.\n\nTypes of Red Wine\nLearn about Merlot, Malbec, and more in this list of red wine types. Red wine is like a lot of other topics that people are passionate about. There’s an overwhelming amount of information you can learn about red wine. There are dozens of varietals that are made all over the world. There are single varietal wines (wines made from a single type of grape) and red wine blends. There are wines named after the grape they are made from, and there are wines named after the region in which the wine was made. You can learn about different vintage years in different parts of the world, and you can learn about what different weather and climate conditions mean for the finished wine.

Zinfandels have moderate tannin, high acidity, and often a higher than typical alcohol content.

What to Eat with Red Wine: 8 Delicious Red Wine Pairings\nThis full-bodied red wine is made mostly in Argentina, with some wine coming out of France. French and Argentinian varieties taste very different. A Malbec from Argentina (which is the most popular) is fruit forward, with flavors of blackberry and plum. A French Malbec is tarter (black plum, currant), with higher acidity and peppery flavors. This wine pairs well with dark meat poultry, lean red meats, and funky flavors like blue cheese and mushroom.\n\nPairing Food and Wine\nThrow out the old rules-of-thumb\nThere are a whole bunch of rules-of thumb that have developed over the years\n- Serve white wine with fish or white meat and red wine with red meat\n- Serve red wine at room temperature (whatever that might be)\n- You only decant red wine\n- Serve white wine cold\nAll of which only have the tiniest speck of truth, if any at all. Our particular bug bear is cold white wine. Most restaurant serve white wine at the same temperature as lager. What this achieves is to make the wine hide away – no nose and almost no taste. Which is kind of what we think of lager! Older wines and aromatic wines should be served only lightly chilled – around 15C. But, this section is about pairing food and wine. It’s not about rules but about a framework in which to decide what goes with what. We are indebted to Katarina van Niekerk and Brian Burke who have written a very good and extensive book called The Food & Wine Pairing Guide (Struik Lifestyle, Cape Town, 2009) for the basis of what we have written here. If you want to find out more we suggest you buy their book (e-book available on Apple and Amazon). Their framework contains just three things to consider when you are selecting a wine to accompany a dish; weight; flavour intensity; and the role of the five primary taste sensations. See below for more details on each. The weight of a dish is the most important thing to take into account and one should always aim to balance the weight of the food with the weight of the wine, so that neither overwhelms the other. The food range from light to heavy is, for example, white fish; chicken; grilled meats; hearty stews. For white wines it is Pinot Gris; Riesling; Sauvignon Blanc; unoaked Chardonnay; Semillon; oaked Chardonnay. And for red wines, Pinot Noir; merlot; Malbec; Shiraz; Cabernet Sauvignon. So chicken, for example, pairs well with the heavier whites and the lighter reds. Although cold roast chicken goes well with an off-dry, low alcohol, Riesling on Sunday evenings. But the biggest challenge is often posed by the sauce in the dish - sauces rule. Many people choose a creamy pepper or mushroom sauce to go with grilled steak. Together, this makes for a heavy dish that needs to be paired with an equally heavy wine. The creaminess of the sauce demands an equally creamy wine. A buttery, velvety, oaked Chardonnay or Semillon provides both the weight that the steak needs and the creamy texture that the sauce demands. By flavour intensity we mean the degree of flavour that a dish has; ranging from bland to spicy. Again one should aim to balance the flavour intensity of the wine and the food. Flavour intensity for white wine ranges from the subtlety of a Pinot Gris or an unoaked Chardonnay (think Chablis) up through Rieslings to Sauvignon Blanc (especially New World Sauvignons) or Gewürztraminer. For red wines Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz and Grenache (southern Rhone wines) have far more flavour intensity than Pinot Noir. But we think the distinction is far more along the new world \/ old world dimension; new world reds having far more flavour intensity than old world wines. From food’s perspective the subtle flavour end of the range is with light coloured meat and fish or red meat with little fat such as fillet. At the intense flavour end are the dark coloured meats and fish or meats with lots of fat such as lamb or prime rib. The five primary taste sensations\nWines and foods share some basic tastes. Physically, we have taste buds that give us the intrinsic ability to register five primary taste sensations in the mouth: sweetness; acidity; saltiness; bitterness and umami (or 'savoury'). Each of these five tastes is present to some degree, and in various combinations and permutations, in all foods. Wine is also a combination of primary tastes, usually three: sweetness; acidity (sourness) and, in the case of red wine, umami. These combinations define a wine's profile and determine with what food it is best served.\n\nAnd the majority of the time, when you’re serving wine, there will be some sort of food involved. So it’s important to know the basics of food & wine pairing. Right now, there’s only one principle that you need to be aware of when you’re matching wine with food: The lighter the food, the lighter the wine. The richer the food, the richer the wine. It’s as simple as that. For example, red meats, like beef and lamb, are considered to be rich and heavy foods. According to the principle, that means that they would match very well with a rich and heavy wine. Like a full-bodied red wine. On the other side of the spectrum, oysters are a very light and delicate food. So they wouldn’t match very well with a rich full-bodied red wine. But they would match extremely well with a lighter styled wine, like a sparkling wine or a light-bodied white wine. If you only applied this principal, most of the time, you would nail your food & wine pairings. But what about the food & wine that land in the middle of the spectrum? For example, what type of food would go well with a light-bodied red wine or a full-bodied white wine? Well, the answer isn’t a simple as ‘this food goes with that’ or ‘that wine goes with this’. Most foods go well with a few different styles of wine and vice-versa. And it takes a bit of experimentation and memorization to learn what types of food go well with what styles of wine. It also depends on what people like. In part 4, we’ll give you some specific details of what types of wine go with what types of food. For now, it’s sufficient enough to know that light foods, go with light wines. And rich foods, go with rich wines. We’ve just been through a lot there. So take your time with it. Once you have a solid understanding of how to taste wine, describe it, and pair wine with food, you’ll have developed all the tools you need to learn about wine and confidently talk about it with anyone. In part 3 of this guide, you’ll be learning how to put those tools to practical use as a bartender. You’ll learn how to recommend wine you know the customer will enjoy. And then you’ll learn how to serve it like a pro. Until then, remember my sommelier friend’s advice, ‘In order to learn about wine, you must drink wine!’ So go out there, buy a few bottles, and start doing your ‘research’.\n\nUndoubtedly, it can be confusing when it comes to choosing the perfect wine with different food, especially if you are new in the field. That is why we have compiled some fundamentals tips and advice to help you pair your wine and food in the correct way below. Here’s What You Need to Know for Great Wine and Food Pairings\nThere Need to Have More Acidic than the Meal\nYou need to choose a wine having a very sour or sharp taste; in other words, the amount of acidic should be higher than your food. In this way, you will enjoy the wine much better. The Food Should Be Less Sweeter than the Wine\nUndoubtedly, the food you are having need to contain less sugar than the wine you are drinking. Else, you will not genuinely have the authentic taste of the wine. Drink Low-Alcohol Wine with Spicy Foods\nIt is advisable to drink wine with a low amount of alcohol with spicy food since this can cause stomach burn and deprive you of the wine’s actual taste due to the burning sensation in the mouth. Red Meat is Best to Drink Red Wine With\nIf you have red meat for a meal, consider having a glass of red wine to make the meal more delicious. Red meat with red wine has always been the best combination that could exist. Choose Lighter Wine for Dessert\nWhen having dessert, it is advisable to choose lighter consistency of wine. This will allow you to enjoy your dessert to its authentic taste, especially if it contains sugar. Cheese and Rosé Wine is an Excellent Combination\nHave you ever tried Rosé wine with cheese? If not, you are imperatively missing something excellent. Consider tasting both, and see how delicious the meal will be.\n\nBecause you won’t be able to describe a wine to customers if you don’t know what to describe in the first place! The 5 principle characteristics of wine are:\n- Flavour Profile (fruit, oak, earth, other)\nThe first element you need to be aware of is the ‘body’ of the wine. The ‘body’ is simply a way of categorizing different styles of wine from lightest to boldest. In general, knowing the body of a wine is as simple as knowing the grape variety. Because most of the time, grape varieties share the same ‘body’ regardless of how or where the wine was made. Red wines are categorized into light-bodied, medium-bodied, and full-bodied wines. Whereas white wines are categorized into light-bodied, full-bodied, and aromatic wines. The difference between these styles of wine will be obvious once you’ve tasted them side by side. But a great way to think about them is to compare the difference between skim and full cream milk. Full cream milk is much richer and fuller in flavor than skim milk. The same can be said for full-bodied wine in comparison to light-bodied wine. With medium-bodied wine landing somewhere in the middle. The aromatic white wines category simply means that the wine will have highly perfumed and sweet fruit aromas. Although that doesn’t necessarily mean that the wine itself will be sweet. The sweetness\/dryness of a wine is referring to how much residual sugar is left in the wine (i.e. how sweet the wine is). If there’s a lot, you’ll describe the wine as ‘very sweet’. If there’s hardly any, you’ll describe the wine as ‘very dry’. This is a characteristic you’ll need to describe with all white, sparkling, and rosé wines. But you won’t need to worry about describing the sweetness levels of red wines as they all have some element of sweetness. Customers will commonly ask you for dry white wines. Even though the majority of white wines are dry, it generally means that they’re looking for the driest wine possible. Acids are what gives a wine its sour\/tart flavor. When you taste citrus (lemon, lime, orange) in a wine, it’s because the wine has some element of acidity. You can also feel a wine’s level of acidity because it will make your mouth water. This is an important characteristic to describe with all styles of wine. All white wines have some element of citrus which makes tasting the acidity obvious. But red wines can have high levels of acids too. But because red wines have higher amounts of sugar, the sweetness balances out the acids so they’re not as obvious (think about balancing simple syrup with lemon\/lime juice in cocktails). The sauvignon blanc white wine is a great example of what a wine with high acidity tastes like. It tastes sour, there are strong elements of citrus, and it makes your mouth water. Tannins are unique to red wines. So you don’t need to worry about describing them when you’re dealing with white wines. Tannins are what cause the grippy\/drying feeling on your tongue and that’s how you’ll recognize them. A high tannin wine will almost make your tongue feel numb. This is an important characteristic to cover when you’re describing red wines. If you’re looking for an example of tannin, you only need to taste a young vintage Cabernet Sauvignon red wine and you’ll know exactly what I mean. This is when a glass of wine starts to get interesting. When I mentioned in part 1 that the astute wine drinker can pick up tobacco, mint, vanilla, citrus, cherry, and even sweaty socks in a glass of wine, this is what I was talking about. The flavor profile of a wine is essential every flavor\/scent that we can smell in the wine. There are a lot of different flavors in this world, even within wine. So to make understanding them easier, they can be broken down into 4 major categories: fruit, oak, earth, and the catchall ‘other.’\nWhen you taste & smell wine you should try and identify any flavors (or lack thereof) from each of these categories. Every wine has some element of fruit in it. Some of these fruits are out there and more exotic, whilst others are a lot more familiar and closer to home.\n\nWine is meant to have a partner. Food. As the two enter their union, the full flavors of both the wine and food stretch throughout all of the lovely layers and deepen the satiation and satisfaction of the dining experience. When I am in Bend, I look to our local grocer Newport Market to help me pick out my wine and trust the wine buyers there to not only recommend but share what they love about a particular wine. If I am picking out a wine to pair with a dish I have never made, I look no further than Suzi who has always steered me in delicious directions. From pairing with seafood to trout to lamb to paella, she suggests varying price points and leaves me to decide. Perhaps that is the key as well, know who to ask and who to trust for recommendations. For nine years when I lived near Walla Walla, Washington’s nearly 100 wineries, I trusted my own palate as we would visit the tasting rooms, often without a fee (and if there was a fee, it was $5 that could go toward your wine purchase), but that option is not available unless I travel now that I live in central Oregon – which perhaps is yet another reason to travel. 🙂\nHowever, to stick to hard-and-fast rules about what wine should go with what, while something to consider and inquire as to why, shouldn’t be adhered to absolutely nor blindly. Drink what you like, like what you drink was often a motto I would hear and for the most part, agree with. What I would add would be to just remember to pair it with food you enjoy as well. The entire flavor profile of the wine and the food when partnered, as mentioned above, changes, and often those traditional pairing suggestions reveal their wisdom. From something as simple as a luscious red cabernet-blend paired with a hamburger nestled between a brioche bun to a bouillabaisse paired with a light, crisp sauvignon blanc or viognier, if there is food, there is a wine that will pair with it and the experience will be all the more scrumptious and memorable because of it. There are many books available to deepen your knowledge of wine. Depending upon what your sense of humor, depth of curiosity and any other preference, there is a book for you. I have gathered up a few below.

It’s just unbelievably rich, and weighty, like taking a big gulp of whole milk — or even chocolate milk — and it’s totally hedonistic and delicious.”\nLike acidity, sweetness is a taste that can be perceived by the tongue. Sweetness can be balanced by other components in the wine, particularly acid and tannin, so sweetness can be cloying or help smooth out the wine, depending on the overall balance. Say it about an off-dry (almost imperceptibly) sweet wine: “Oh, this is good. There’ just a hint of sweetness on the tip of my tongue, but there’s lots of juicy acidity to keep it lively and fresh.”\nSay it about a fully sweet white wine: “This is unreal! It’s just everything you ever wanted in a dessert wine — it’s rich and unctuous and viscous and beautifully sweet, like the best 3-Michelin-Star dessert you’ve ever had, only liquified!”\nAnd there you have it. For practicality’s sake, the wines curated in our Wine Access store each include a flavor profile to help you understand the complexities of the wine. These flavor profiles provide a deeper understanding of each wine so you can pinpoint the attributes you enjoy in wine. And with this guide, you can really know (or at least sound like you know) what you’re talking about when you’re talking about a wine.\n\nYou may have noticed that we've begun to incorporate pairing suggestions with some of our products, beginning with our red meats, like a Bonanza Cabernet Sauvignon by Caymus with our Chuck Roast (one of Bryce's favorites). We believe it's fairly common knowledge that red wines go well with red meat and, on the flip side, it's common for white wines to be paired with lighter meats, especially fish. And while grabbing any wine willy nilly is likely to enhance your dining experience, we think you'll find the art of intentional pairing to be quite rewarding. It certainly causes us to be more present in the dining moment, and remain more conscious of the flavor profiles for the entire meal. We thought some of you may not be convinced right off the bat so we decided to bring science and some beginner tips to the table to get you started. First, off, why red with red and white with white? Red wines tend to be heavier in body and more robust in taste than white wine. The same can be said about red and white meat. Thus, if you were to pair red wine with tilapia, there's a good chance you'll see the flavors of the tilapia overpowered and wiped out by the red wine. It doesn't get much more complicated than that, at least at the early beginners level. If you're already on board with the red-red\/white-white concept, then here are some additional tips and pairings that may interest you. The GOLDEN RULE: Taste is Subjective\nAlways remember what you taste is personal. If a combination pleases you then it is a good choice. Focus on the Dominant Flavors\nWhile we just took up your time going on and on about pairing with meats, it's important to remember that the meat may not always be the dominant flavor of the dish. Did you make a crazy good, crazy flavorful sauce to go with it? There's your pairing target! When in Doubt, Pinot Noir\nPinot Noir is notorious for having a light-medium body. It's sort of in the middle on the whole spectrum which helps it go with many foods. More Sweet, More Acidic\nThis one is a simple and generic, but highly effective trick that's likely to take your pairing ability and experience to the next level. The wine should [almost] always be more acidic and sweeter than the food. Spice High, Alcohol Content Low\nAlcohol amplifies the oils that make spicy food hot. Stick to wines that are low in alcohol, such as off-dry German Rieslings. Smoke with Oak\nOaked wines are often more intense, and therefore they can overwhelm the flavors in a dish. By pairing them with foods that match that intensity, you'll find the strong oak notes suddenly tamed and the fruit flavors of the wine will be brought out instead. All the Things\nFinally, here's a nice all-around reference to help you figure this all out. As a reminder though, the most important rule is to do what you like and have fun. Cheers!\n\nA simple approach to wine buying is to match the acidity of the wine with the acidity of the dish. That’s because you don’t want the acidity of the food to overpower the wine. Both white and red wines (depending on the darkness of the skins) can be acidic depending on how they were made (like being aged in an oak barrel versus a steel barrel). Some foods, like chicken and pork, can go with either white or red wine depending on how they’re prepared. Generally, I suggest a white wine for either, and maybe a rosé (often midway in its acidity – thus one of my favorite food wine pairs) or light red, depending on the overall flavor. As for red wines, the skins and seeds included in the pressing and fermentation release even more tannic acids and alcohols into the wines – creating the flavor and color. Remember that with red wines, the lighter the wine color, the lower the tannins. That’s what creates the spectrum, varying levels of tannins. Fatty foods like steak require heavy-tannin reds like cabernets and merlots. Meanwhile, light to moderate fatty foods like salmon or pork can pair well with a light red like a pinot or Chianti. Finally, there’s one more rule for simple pairing… Pair spice with sweet. Sweeter wines, especially whites like riesling, tend to pair better with spicier foods like Thai and Mexican. That’s because sweeter wines help coat your burning tongue (from the spiciness) with sugars. Keep in mind, lower alcohol wines, like riesling and moscato, are also gentler on your palate as you enjoy spicy foods. These are my basic rules for wine pairing:\n- Focus on your taste and what you imagine it tastes like. - Make a guess as to how many tannins are in the wine. Weigh that against how heavy and acidic your food is… lemon mango salsa grilled tuna needs a bright acidic white wine with texture and body. A heavy rib eye with gravy and potatoes needs a dark and perhaps oaked red wine. And in between, say turkey or ham deserves a heavier white wine, a crisp rosé or lighter red. - Pair spicy with sweet. To make it even easier, here’s a list I put together for the most common food and wine pairings…\n- Fish: White\n- Pork: Rosé or white\n- Chicken: White or light red\n- Beef: Red\n- Pasta: Light red, though richer pasta dishes need acidic and ageable red wines\nKeep in mind, these are general rules based on food chemistry. You may find varieties of wines that go better with your meal but appear to break these rules. An old classmate of mine from graduate school at Kellogg once wrote to tell me he’d just had my Eifrig Cabernet Sauvignon with grilled swordfish on the beach. I loved it… it’s easy to see how my reds could balance the meatier texture of swordfish. And the oil and richness of the fish was complemented by the perfectly balanced acids and heavier tannins of my cabernet. Remember… The best part of learning about wine is trying and discovering what you like! The most important thing is that the value of wine tasting lies with you, the individual taster. Spending hundreds of dollars on a “good” bottle of wine doesn’t mean you’ll enjoy it (unless it’s mine of course). The best way to experience new wines pre-coronavirus was to stop by a local wine store for free tastings – often done several times a month. In some places and states, they might still be doing this… just call the store or check its website to see when it offers an event. It’s a great way to sample wine for free and get closer to finding your ideal wine. Likewise, when I’m dining out, I always ask the wait staff what they’d recommend with my dish and then ask them to get me a sip of a couple ideas before I pick what I want.

While there’s no strict rule as to what you should eat with your favourite red wine, especially because everyone has different palettes and preferences, there are certain reasons why wine connoisseurs make specific food and wine pairing suggestions. If you’re new to the world of developing your wine palette, that’s okay! Half the fun is understanding what notes to look for, learning what the different bodies of wine are, and what flavours best match its notes. Have you ever been sent to the liquor store with instructions to “buy red wine” but you aren’t sure what kind to get? Surely there has to be certain meanings behind each kind. We’re here to tell you that yes, each kind is completely different. Below, we’ll go over the differences (in alphabetical order) between the types of red wines so you’ll never have to feel confused about which kind to buy again. These types of grapes do well in a cooler climate, therefore, they thrive in Ontario (though they originated in France). They’re known for being very flavourful with earthy and spicy notes which is why they’re used to create drier red wines. These types of grapes thrive in both humid and cooler environments. They’re the most common type of grape that mainly come from places like Napa Valley, Australia, and the Niagara Region. They’re a little more fruity, acidic, and a deeper colour of red. If you’re looking for a unique combination, you’ll love this type of red wine that’s popularly found in Niagara. It’s often mixed with Merlot or Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and then aged in oak barrels. The oak barrels bring out the unique flavours even more and provide a more “dry” structure to the wine. This is another very popular type of grape because of its ease to mix with others and to try drinking for beginners. It’s often soft, smooth, sweet, and makes a great math for any dish or dessert. Malbec grapes are most famously known for growing in Argentina even though they originated in France. Because of these grapes being darker and thicker skinned, their sweetness and fruity flavours create a less-dry red wine. Known as one of the lighter reds, Pinot Noir wine is fruity, smoothy, and much like Merlot, it can make the perfect match for any dish or dessert. But did you know that Pinot Noir grapes are the hardest to grow? Because of their thin skin, they’re more susceptible to being damaged by temperatures or by themselves since they grow tightly together. Zinfandel is largely grown in the United States in more humid climates like Napa Valley and Lodi. It makes for a very fruity red wine but on the other hand, has subtle flavours of licorice and tobacco. It’s another wine that’s very easy to drink, making it the perfect pairing for most dishes. Note: Full, medium and light-bodied refers to the alcohol content. The fuller the body of wine, the higher alcohol content it contains (more than 13.5%). The lighter the body of wine, the lower the alcohol content (less than 12.5%). Nothing pairs together more perfectly than wine and food, especially after you’ve had a long day or you haven’t spent a night out (or in) with your friends in a long time. But how do you decide what to order with your glass of wine? Remember, the choice is completely up to you and your specific preferences, but here are the best wine and food pairings strictly based on the types of notes the red wine contains. Red meat, whether it be land, grilled steak, or burgers, make a great match for Cabernet Sauvignon. This type of full-bodied red wine has strong, deep and fruity flavours, so pairing it with equally strong meat flavours will make for a delicious dinner you won’t soon forget. The meat can also dial down the acidity and sweetness of the wine if that’s what you desire. If you’re opting for a hearty stew such as beef bourguignon, for example, Merlot is a great wine pairing to bring out the soft flavours of both the dish and the wine.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:4f359aa1-c466-4885-a308-88f6dde8288b>"]},{"passage":"Types of Red Wine\nLearn about Merlot, Malbec, and more in this list of red wine types. Red wine is like a lot of other topics that people are passionate about. There’s an overwhelming amount of information you can learn about red wine. There are dozens of varietals that are made all over the world. There are single varietal wines (wines made from a single type of grape) and red wine blends. There are wines named after the grape they are made from, and there are wines named after the region in which the wine was made. You can learn about different vintage years in different parts of the world, and you can learn about what different weather and climate conditions mean for the finished wine. In short: there’s a lot to learn about red wine. However, red wine is also like other topics that people are passionate about in this way:\nYou can generally get along just fine by knowing a few basics. That’s what we’re here to discuss. We’ll cover a few basic red wine types that you’ll find on almost any restaurant menu. We’ll cover what these wines taste like, any notable facts about the wine, and what types of food you can pair it with. It’s your cheat sheet to types of red wine. Pinot Noir wine is light-bodied, light red in color, and translucent. The flavor is subtle and has low tannins, but the acidity is nice and bright. The taste is fruity and delicate; you will probably find notes of cherry, strawberry, or raspberry. Earthy flavors may also be present, which is why this wine pairs well with recipes with mushrooms. This is a popular wine, and wine enthusiasts study its complex flavor and unique grape.

It’s full-bodied and has strong tannins. The aroma often has notes of dark cherry and vanilla, and tasting notes may be herbaceous and have hints of green pepper. Cabernet Sauvignons are excellent complements to food and go well with steak and other rich red meat dishes.

Syrah (or Shiraz)\nThere are two names for this variety of wine. European vintners only use the name “Syrah.” The wine is well known as a dark, almost inky, full-bodied wine. It is very smooth and has flavors of dark fruit such as blackcurrant and plum; this is a hearty, often spicy, red. Syrah has gripping tannins and is excellent when paired with red meat or other bold, flavorful foods. It is also a nice complement to many soft or stinky cheeses.

Our particular bug bear is cold white wine. Most restaurant serve white wine at the same temperature as lager. What this achieves is to make the wine hide away – no nose and almost no taste. Which is kind of what we think of lager! Older wines and aromatic wines should be served only lightly chilled – around 15C. But, this section is about pairing food and wine. It’s not about rules but about a framework in which to decide what goes with what. We are indebted to Katarina van Niekerk and Brian Burke who have written a very good and extensive book called The Food & Wine Pairing Guide (Struik Lifestyle, Cape Town, 2009) for the basis of what we have written here. If you want to find out more we suggest you buy their book (e-book available on Apple and Amazon). Their framework contains just three things to consider when you are selecting a wine to accompany a dish; weight; flavour intensity; and the role of the five primary taste sensations. See below for more details on each. The weight of a dish is the most important thing to take into account and one should always aim to balance the weight of the food with the weight of the wine, so that neither overwhelms the other. The food range from light to heavy is, for example, white fish; chicken; grilled meats; hearty stews. For white wines it is Pinot Gris; Riesling; Sauvignon Blanc; unoaked Chardonnay; Semillon; oaked Chardonnay. And for red wines, Pinot Noir; merlot; Malbec; Shiraz; Cabernet Sauvignon. So chicken, for example, pairs well with the heavier whites and the lighter reds. Although cold roast chicken goes well with an off-dry, low alcohol, Riesling on Sunday evenings. But the biggest challenge is often posed by the sauce in the dish - sauces rule. Many people choose a creamy pepper or mushroom sauce to go with grilled steak. Together, this makes for a heavy dish that needs to be paired with an equally heavy wine. The creaminess of the sauce demands an equally creamy wine. A buttery, velvety, oaked Chardonnay or Semillon provides both the weight that the steak needs and the creamy texture that the sauce demands. By flavour intensity we mean the degree of flavour that a dish has; ranging from bland to spicy. Again one should aim to balance the flavour intensity of the wine and the food. Flavour intensity for white wine ranges from the subtlety of a Pinot Gris or an unoaked Chardonnay (think Chablis) up through Rieslings to Sauvignon Blanc (especially New World Sauvignons) or Gewürztraminer. For red wines Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz and Grenache (southern Rhone wines) have far more flavour intensity than Pinot Noir. But we think the distinction is far more along the new world \/ old world dimension; new world reds having far more flavour intensity than old world wines. From food’s perspective the subtle flavour end of the range is with light coloured meat and fish or red meat with little fat such as fillet. At the intense flavour end are the dark coloured meats and fish or meats with lots of fat such as lamb or prime rib. The five primary taste sensations\nWines and foods share some basic tastes. Physically, we have taste buds that give us the intrinsic ability to register five primary taste sensations in the mouth: sweetness; acidity; saltiness; bitterness and umami (or 'savoury'). Each of these five tastes is present to some degree, and in various combinations and permutations, in all foods. Wine is also a combination of primary tastes, usually three: sweetness; acidity (sourness) and, in the case of red wine, umami. These combinations define a wine's profile and determine with what food it is best served.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:b3db4d4b-49df-4c28-bb87-69e6c3e27e32>"]},{"passage":"And the majority of the time, when you’re serving wine, there will be some sort of food involved. So it’s important to know the basics of food & wine pairing. Right now, there’s only one principle that you need to be aware of when you’re matching wine with food: The lighter the food, the lighter the wine. The richer the food, the richer the wine. It’s as simple as that. For example, red meats, like beef and lamb, are considered to be rich and heavy foods. According to the principle, that means that they would match very well with a rich and heavy wine. Like a full-bodied red wine. On the other side of the spectrum, oysters are a very light and delicate food. So they wouldn’t match very well with a rich full-bodied red wine. But they would match extremely well with a lighter styled wine, like a sparkling wine or a light-bodied white wine. If you only applied this principal, most of the time, you would nail your food & wine pairings. But what about the food & wine that land in the middle of the spectrum? For example, what type of food would go well with a light-bodied red wine or a full-bodied white wine? Well, the answer isn’t a simple as ‘this food goes with that’ or ‘that wine goes with this’. Most foods go well with a few different styles of wine and vice-versa. And it takes a bit of experimentation and memorization to learn what types of food go well with what styles of wine. It also depends on what people like. In part 4, we’ll give you some specific details of what types of wine go with what types of food. For now, it’s sufficient enough to know that light foods, go with light wines. And rich foods, go with rich wines. We’ve just been through a lot there. So take your time with it. Once you have a solid understanding of how to taste wine, describe it, and pair wine with food, you’ll have developed all the tools you need to learn about wine and confidently talk about it with anyone. In part 3 of this guide, you’ll be learning how to put those tools to practical use as a bartender. You’ll learn how to recommend wine you know the customer will enjoy. And then you’ll learn how to serve it like a pro. Until then, remember my sommelier friend’s advice, ‘In order to learn about wine, you must drink wine!’ So go out there, buy a few bottles, and start doing your ‘research’.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:9e75b67f-6e14-4632-a2d7-b5a463d362e0>"]},{"passage":"Undoubtedly, it can be confusing when it comes to choosing the perfect wine with different food, especially if you are new in the field. That is why we have compiled some fundamentals tips and advice to help you pair your wine and food in the correct way below. Here’s What You Need to Know for Great Wine and Food Pairings\nThere Need to Have More Acidic than the Meal\nYou need to choose a wine having a very sour or sharp taste; in other words, the amount of acidic should be higher than your food. In this way, you will enjoy the wine much better. The Food Should Be Less Sweeter than the Wine\nUndoubtedly, the food you are having need to contain less sugar than the wine you are drinking. Else, you will not genuinely have the authentic taste of the wine. Drink Low-Alcohol Wine with Spicy Foods\nIt is advisable to drink wine with a low amount of alcohol with spicy food since this can cause stomach burn and deprive you of the wine’s actual taste due to the burning sensation in the mouth. Red Meat is Best to Drink Red Wine With\nIf you have red meat for a meal, consider having a glass of red wine to make the meal more delicious. Red meat with red wine has always been the best combination that could exist. Choose Lighter Wine for Dessert\nWhen having dessert, it is advisable to choose lighter consistency of wine. This will allow you to enjoy your dessert to its authentic taste, especially if it contains sugar. Cheese and Rosé Wine is an Excellent Combination\nHave you ever tried Rosé wine with cheese? If not, you are imperatively missing something excellent. Consider tasting both, and see how delicious the meal will be.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:f46d1542-3d42-4168-94ae-ed2f5031c30b>"]},{"passage":"Because you won’t be able to describe a wine to customers if you don’t know what to describe in the first place! The 5 principle characteristics of wine are:\n- Flavour Profile (fruit, oak, earth, other)\nThe first element you need to be aware of is the ‘body’ of the wine. The ‘body’ is simply a way of categorizing different styles of wine from lightest to boldest. In general, knowing the body of a wine is as simple as knowing the grape variety. Because most of the time, grape varieties share the same ‘body’ regardless of how or where the wine was made. Red wines are categorized into light-bodied, medium-bodied, and full-bodied wines. Whereas white wines are categorized into light-bodied, full-bodied, and aromatic wines. The difference between these styles of wine will be obvious once you’ve tasted them side by side. But a great way to think about them is to compare the difference between skim and full cream milk. Full cream milk is much richer and fuller in flavor than skim milk. The same can be said for full-bodied wine in comparison to light-bodied wine. With medium-bodied wine landing somewhere in the middle. The aromatic white wines category simply means that the wine will have highly perfumed and sweet fruit aromas. Although that doesn’t necessarily mean that the wine itself will be sweet. The sweetness\/dryness of a wine is referring to how much residual sugar is left in the wine (i.e. how sweet the wine is). If there’s a lot, you’ll describe the wine as ‘very sweet’. If there’s hardly any, you’ll describe the wine as ‘very dry’. This is a characteristic you’ll need to describe with all white, sparkling, and rosé wines. But you won’t need to worry about describing the sweetness levels of red wines as they all have some element of sweetness. Customers will commonly ask you for dry white wines. Even though the majority of white wines are dry, it generally means that they’re looking for the driest wine possible. Acids are what gives a wine its sour\/tart flavor. When you taste citrus (lemon, lime, orange) in a wine, it’s because the wine has some element of acidity. You can also feel a wine’s level of acidity because it will make your mouth water. This is an important characteristic to describe with all styles of wine. All white wines have some element of citrus which makes tasting the acidity obvious. But red wines can have high levels of acids too. But because red wines have higher amounts of sugar, the sweetness balances out the acids so they’re not as obvious (think about balancing simple syrup with lemon\/lime juice in cocktails). The sauvignon blanc white wine is a great example of what a wine with high acidity tastes like. It tastes sour, there are strong elements of citrus, and it makes your mouth water. Tannins are unique to red wines. So you don’t need to worry about describing them when you’re dealing with white wines. Tannins are what cause the grippy\/drying feeling on your tongue and that’s how you’ll recognize them. A high tannin wine will almost make your tongue feel numb. This is an important characteristic to cover when you’re describing red wines. If you’re looking for an example of tannin, you only need to taste a young vintage Cabernet Sauvignon red wine and you’ll know exactly what I mean. This is when a glass of wine starts to get interesting. When I mentioned in part 1 that the astute wine drinker can pick up tobacco, mint, vanilla, citrus, cherry, and even sweaty socks in a glass of wine, this is what I was talking about. The flavor profile of a wine is essential every flavor\/scent that we can smell in the wine. There are a lot of different flavors in this world, even within wine. So to make understanding them easier, they can be broken down into 4 major categories: fruit, oak, earth, and the catchall ‘other.’\nWhen you taste & smell wine you should try and identify any flavors (or lack thereof) from each of these categories. Every wine has some element of fruit in it. Some of these fruits are out there and more exotic, whilst others are a lot more familiar and closer to home.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:9e75b67f-6e14-4632-a2d7-b5a463d362e0>"]},{"passage":"Wine is meant to have a partner. Food. As the two enter their union, the full flavors of both the wine and food stretch throughout all of the lovely layers and deepen the satiation and satisfaction of the dining experience. When I am in Bend, I look to our local grocer Newport Market to help me pick out my wine and trust the wine buyers there to not only recommend but share what they love about a particular wine. If I am picking out a wine to pair with a dish I have never made, I look no further than Suzi who has always steered me in delicious directions. From pairing with seafood to trout to lamb to paella, she suggests varying price points and leaves me to decide. Perhaps that is the key as well, know who to ask and who to trust for recommendations. For nine years when I lived near Walla Walla, Washington’s nearly 100 wineries, I trusted my own palate as we would visit the tasting rooms, often without a fee (and if there was a fee, it was $5 that could go toward your wine purchase), but that option is not available unless I travel now that I live in central Oregon – which perhaps is yet another reason to travel. 🙂\nHowever, to stick to hard-and-fast rules about what wine should go with what, while something to consider and inquire as to why, shouldn’t be adhered to absolutely nor blindly. Drink what you like, like what you drink was often a motto I would hear and for the most part, agree with. What I would add would be to just remember to pair it with food you enjoy as well. The entire flavor profile of the wine and the food when partnered, as mentioned above, changes, and often those traditional pairing suggestions reveal their wisdom. From something as simple as a luscious red cabernet-blend paired with a hamburger nestled between a brioche bun to a bouillabaisse paired with a light, crisp sauvignon blanc or viognier, if there is food, there is a wine that will pair with it and the experience will be all the more scrumptious and memorable because of it. There are many books available to deepen your knowledge of wine. Depending upon what your sense of humor, depth of curiosity and any other preference, there is a book for you. I have gathered up a few below.

It’s just unbelievably rich, and weighty, like taking a big gulp of whole milk — or even chocolate milk — and it’s totally hedonistic and delicious.”\nLike acidity, sweetness is a taste that can be perceived by the tongue. Sweetness can be balanced by other components in the wine, particularly acid and tannin, so sweetness can be cloying or help smooth out the wine, depending on the overall balance. Say it about an off-dry (almost imperceptibly) sweet wine: “Oh, this is good. There’ just a hint of sweetness on the tip of my tongue, but there’s lots of juicy acidity to keep it lively and fresh.”\nSay it about a fully sweet white wine: “This is unreal! It’s just everything you ever wanted in a dessert wine — it’s rich and unctuous and viscous and beautifully sweet, like the best 3-Michelin-Star dessert you’ve ever had, only liquified!”\nAnd there you have it.

We believe it's fairly common knowledge that red wines go well with red meat and, on the flip side, it's common for white wines to be paired with lighter meats, especially fish. And while grabbing any wine willy nilly is likely to enhance your dining experience, we think you'll find the art of intentional pairing to be quite rewarding. It certainly causes us to be more present in the dining moment, and remain more conscious of the flavor profiles for the entire meal. We thought some of you may not be convinced right off the bat so we decided to bring science and some beginner tips to the table to get you started. First, off, why red with red and white with white? Red wines tend to be heavier in body and more robust in taste than white wine. The same can be said about red and white meat. Thus, if you were to pair red wine with tilapia, there's a good chance you'll see the flavors of the tilapia overpowered and wiped out by the red wine. It doesn't get much more complicated than that, at least at the early beginners level. If you're already on board with the red-red\/white-white concept, then here are some additional tips and pairings that may interest you. The GOLDEN RULE: Taste is Subjective\nAlways remember what you taste is personal. If a combination pleases you then it is a good choice. Focus on the Dominant Flavors\nWhile we just took up your time going on and on about pairing with meats, it's important to remember that the meat may not always be the dominant flavor of the dish. Did you make a crazy good, crazy flavorful sauce to go with it? There's your pairing target! When in Doubt, Pinot Noir\nPinot Noir is notorious for having a light-medium body. It's sort of in the middle on the whole spectrum which helps it go with many foods. More Sweet, More Acidic\nThis one is a simple and generic, but highly effective trick that's likely to take your pairing ability and experience to the next level. The wine should [almost] always be more acidic and sweeter than the food. Spice High, Alcohol Content Low\nAlcohol amplifies the oils that make spicy food hot. Stick to wines that are low in alcohol, such as off-dry German Rieslings. Smoke with Oak\nOaked wines are often more intense, and therefore they can overwhelm the flavors in a dish. By pairing them with foods that match that intensity, you'll find the strong oak notes suddenly tamed and the fruit flavors of the wine will be brought out instead. All the Things\nFinally, here's a nice all-around reference to help you figure this all out. As a reminder though, the most important rule is to do what you like and have fun. Cheers!","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:4b634eaa-a56c-4862-a942-9b9d74bf4a5c>"]},{"passage":"A simple approach to wine buying is to match the acidity of the wine with the acidity of the dish. That’s because you don’t want the acidity of the food to overpower the wine. Both white and red wines (depending on the darkness of the skins) can be acidic depending on how they were made (like being aged in an oak barrel versus a steel barrel). Some foods, like chicken and pork, can go with either white or red wine depending on how they’re prepared. Generally, I suggest a white wine for either, and maybe a rosé (often midway in its acidity – thus one of my favorite food wine pairs) or light red, depending on the overall flavor. As for red wines, the skins and seeds included in the pressing and fermentation release even more tannic acids and alcohols into the wines – creating the flavor and color. Remember that with red wines, the lighter the wine color, the lower the tannins. That’s what creates the spectrum, varying levels of tannins. Fatty foods like steak require heavy-tannin reds like cabernets and merlots. Meanwhile, light to moderate fatty foods like salmon or pork can pair well with a light red like a pinot or Chianti. Finally, there’s one more rule for simple pairing… Pair spice with sweet. Sweeter wines, especially whites like riesling, tend to pair better with spicier foods like Thai and Mexican. That’s because sweeter wines help coat your burning tongue (from the spiciness) with sugars. Keep in mind, lower alcohol wines, like riesling and moscato, are also gentler on your palate as you enjoy spicy foods. These are my basic rules for wine pairing:\n- Focus on your taste and what you imagine it tastes like. - Make a guess as to how many tannins are in the wine. Weigh that against how heavy and acidic your food is… lemon mango salsa grilled tuna needs a bright acidic white wine with texture and body. A heavy rib eye with gravy and potatoes needs a dark and perhaps oaked red wine. And in between, say turkey or ham deserves a heavier white wine, a crisp rosé or lighter red. - Pair spicy with sweet. To make it even easier, here’s a list I put together for the most common food and wine pairings…\n- Fish: White\n- Pork: Rosé or white\n- Chicken: White or light red\n- Beef: Red\n- Pasta: Light red, though richer pasta dishes need acidic and ageable red wines\nKeep in mind, these are general rules based on food chemistry. You may find varieties of wines that go better with your meal but appear to break these rules. An old classmate of mine from graduate school at Kellogg once wrote to tell me he’d just had my Eifrig Cabernet Sauvignon with grilled swordfish on the beach. I loved it… it’s easy to see how my reds could balance the meatier texture of swordfish. And the oil and richness of the fish was complemented by the perfectly balanced acids and heavier tannins of my cabernet. Remember… The best part of learning about wine is trying and discovering what you like! The most important thing is that the value of wine tasting lies with you, the individual taster. Spending hundreds of dollars on a “good” bottle of wine doesn’t mean you’ll enjoy it (unless it’s mine of course). The best way to experience new wines pre-coronavirus was to stop by a local wine store for free tastings – often done several times a month. In some places and states, they might still be doing this… just call the store or check its website to see when it offers an event. It’s a great way to sample wine for free and get closer to finding your ideal wine. Likewise, when I’m dining out, I always ask the wait staff what they’d recommend with my dish and then ask them to get me a sip of a couple ideas before I pick what I want.

Bluegrass has influenced many different styles including rock, country, pop and even hip-hop! This list explores the top five bluegrass influences on today’s music scene. The genre of bluegrass was created in the southern Appalachian region of the United States. From its beginning, many genres have been influenced by it. The following are notable influences that are listened to today:\n1) Alternative rock – Some bands with alternative rock roots include Nickel Creek, Widespread Panic, State Radio and Old Crow Medicine Show. Each one of these bands carries the sound of bluegrass in their music. Nickel Creek, specifically, has a lot of folk elements in its songs. 2) Country – The country band Little Big Town got its start in the bluegrass genre. Although they have changed their style to fit mainstream audiences, they still retain some traditional bluegrass sounds in their popular songs. Other notable country artists include Dierks Bentley, Keith Urban and Sara Evans. 3) Folk – The folk band Crooked Still draws its inspiration from bluegrass and old time music. They have released several albums including 2008’s “Shaken by a Low Sound” and 2011’s “Tomorrow Is Going to Be a Brighter Day.” They are very popular in the folk music scene. 4) Pop\/R&B – The pop band Nickel Creek has incorporated bluegrass sounds into its albums for quite some time; their album “A Dotted Line” was released in 2014 and has many of those elements. Another well known bluegrass pop group is the Avett Brothers. They have incorporated bluegrass sounds into their folk-rock music. 5) Hip hop – Recently, several artists have found themselves incorporating bluegrass into hip hop beats and instrumentals. Artists who do this include Jim James of My Morning Jacket, Big Krit and Wiz Khalifa. Each artist brings different elements of bluegrass to their songs. Bluegrass has influenced many different aspects of today’s music scene and continues to be a growing musical genre in the world of music.\n\nEvery man today fits under at least one classification of music essays related to music classifications 1 the classification of film, genre also.

They have the most fans across the planet, but in the United States, this number is even higher. Heavy Metal started its life back in the 60s, as a sub-genre of rock. Some of the best-known names in this genre are Metallica and Iron Maiden. Fans of this type of music are completely into it and their lifestyle is even based on Heavy Metal. - Rock n’ Roll\nRock n’ Roll has been one of the most popular music genres since the day it was invented. Let’s just say that the first traces of this music come from the 50s, but the popularity was significantly increased during the 70s and 80s. ACDC, G N R and many others have made this genre the ultimate choice for most people. This music is commonly produced by a drummer, a singer, bass player and a guitar player. - Alternative music\nThis music genre has no description, nor it can be described actually, simply because it is based on art. We all know that art cannot be defined. Linkin Park, Evanescence and many others made this music extremely popular and extremely desirable. You will need drummer, vocals and a guitar and you are good to go. This is also the hardest music genre to dominate. - Hard Rock\nThis genre isn’t the same as heavy metal or just rock. It is completely different in a matter of fact and it has a lot to offer. Rush, Led Zeppelin and literally, dozens of other bands made this genre the ultimate one if you want to enjoy the music, but at the same time, you want to listen to the beautiful words, great bass and to dance like you have never before. Classical music is still one of the most popular music genres ever. It is completely different than anything else and it is more than just beneficial to listen. Just relax in one of the best massage chairs, turn on the music and relax. First and foremost, this music is always produced by some of the biggest and the best musicians ever known. Mozart, Beethoven, and literally many others have shaped the classical music according to their beliefs. Now, we can simply enjoy that literally forever. And yes, this music is also known for increasing the IQ. Rap has been the most popular type of music in ghettoes, and in groups where people wanted to express themselves in an interesting and original way. This music may be the only kind that can make you laugh and cry at the same time. Since the time it has been first noticed, till now, it has made a significant improvement. Some of the biggest names here are Eminem, Tupac, Nas, Big L and etc. How many of you listen to the jazz music? Probably all of you have listened to it at least a few times in your life. The reason why is very simple. This is a gentle, sensitive music that is rich in feelings and always makes you think about something or someone. All artists from this genre are very popular and there are high chances this is going to be similar to the classical music in the near future. Frank Sinatra, Louis Armstrong, and many others have been responsible for some of the best songs ever. In addition, jazz originated from New Orleans and it has been made by slaves back in a day! - Electronic music\nCommonly known as dance music, or electronic dance music (EDM), is one of those genres that has to be on every list. It has been among us since the 80s, but in the 90s it got very desirable. The place of origin is Europe, but since 2000 electronic music has been introduced in the United States. Nowadays, it is the most common choice for crazy parties and nightclubs where people simply want to relax and dance. Here, words and vocals are not present. On the other side, thebass is something that has an important part. Pop music isn’t the most popular, as you can see, but the highest number of people talk about it every day.\n\nMusical genre classification of audio signals essay musical genre classification of and harmonic content of the music genre classification is magnified when.

How do people find indie music?\n\nMusicologists have sometimes classified music according to a trichotomic distinction such as Philip Tagg's \"axiomatic triangle consisting of'folk','art' and'popular' musics\", he explains that each of these three is distinguishable from the others according to certain criteria. The term art music refers to classical traditions, including both contemporary and historical classical music forms. Art music exists in many parts of the world, it emphasizes formal styles that invite technical and detailed deconstruction and criticism, demand focused attention from the listener. In Western practice, art music is considered a written musical tradition, preserved in some form of music notation rather than being transmitted orally, by rote, or in recordings, as popular and traditional music are. Most western art music has been written down using the standard forms of music notation that evolved in Europe, beginning well before the Renaissance and reaching its maturity in the Romantic period. The identity of a \"work\" or \"piece\" of art music is defined by the notated version rather than by a particular performance, is associated with the composer rather than the performer. This is so in the case of western classical music. Art music may include certain forms of jazz, though some feel that jazz is a form of popular music. Sacred Christian music forms an important part of the classical music tradition and repertoire, but can be considered to have an identity of its own; the term popular music refers to any musical style accessible to the general public and disseminated by the mass media. Musicologist and popular music specialist Philip Tagg defined the notion in the light of sociocultural and economical aspects: Popular music, unlike art music, is conceived for mass distribution to large and socioculturally heterogeneous groups of listeners and distributed in non-written form, only possible in an industrial monetary economy where it becomes a commodity and in capitalist societies, subject to the laws of'free' enterprise... it should ideally sell as much as possible. Popular music is found on most commercial and public service radio stations, in most commercial music retailers and department stores, in movie and television soundtracks. It is noted on the Billboard charts and, in addition to singer-songwriters and composers, it involves music producers more than other genres do; the distinction between classical and popular music has sometimes been blurred in marginal areas such as minimalist music and light classics. Background music for films\/movies draws on both traditions. In this respect, music is like fiction, which draws a distinction between literary fiction and popular fiction, not always precise. Country music known as country and western, hillbilly music, is a genre of popular music that originated in the southern United States in the early 1920s; the polka is a Czech dance and genre of dance music familiar throughout Europe and the Americas. Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as \"rock and roll\" in the United States in the early 1950s, developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and particular\nA drum kit — called a drum set, trap set, or drums — is a collection of drums and other percussion instruments cymbals, which are set up on stands to be played by a single player, with drumsticks held in both hands, the feet operating pedals that control the hi-hat cymbal and the beater for the bass drum. A drum kit consists of a mix of drums and idiophones – most cymbals, but can include the woodblock and cowbell. In the 2000s, some kits include electronic instruments. Both hybrid and electronic kits are used. A standard modern kit, as used in popular music and taught in music schools, contains: A snare drum, mounted on a stand, placed between the player's knees and played with drum sticks A bass drum, played by a pedal operated by the right foot, which moves a felt-covered beater One or more toms, played with sticks or brushes A hi-hat, played with the sticks and closed with left foot pedal One or more cymbals, mounted on stands, played with the sticksAll of these are classified as non-pitched percussion, allowing the music to be scored using percussion notation, for which a loose semi-standardized form exists for both the drum kit and electronic drums. The drum kit is played while seated on a stool known as a throne.\n\nBy Rachael Roberts\nMany students learning English have learned how to talk about their favorite songs and music genres, but don’t know much beyond describing what band they like or a broad description of the type of music they’re interested in. So, let’s take your English to the next level with some native-like ways to describe your musical interests. Try describing your favorite music genre more specifically with sub-genres. While it’s commonly known that there are many genres of music from pop to country, sub-genres are sub-categories within these genres that specify exactly what kind of music you’re talking about. Here are just a few examples but you can easily search online for more. New Wave Pop\nLofi Hip Hop\nUsing the time of the music’s release can help narrow down your musical interest. This is especially useful with genres like pop that can vary greatly from year to year. The type of music released by artists can also change a lot over time, so you can use different points in the career of a band or singer to describe the style of music you like. Here are some examples in sentences. I like listening to 80’s pop. I’m a big fan of early 2000’s alternative rock. Motown from the late 60’s was incredible. The early works of that band are the best. The mood and aesthetic of certain bands become a unique part of the listening experience. Some songs released by even the same artist can sound completely different from each other. Additionally, the aesthetic, or artistic image of a band can sometimes be just as important as the music. In fact, some aesthetics are so intertwined with the music, they merge to create their own sub-genre, like gothic rock. Here are some words to describe mood and aesthetic. Popularity plays a lot into describing music. For example, an important feature of enjoying pop music may be about what’s on top of the charts at the time. On the other hand, many rock music lovers prefer their favorite artists before they become popular. Here are some ways to describe the popularity of your favorite music. Many of these expressions can also be used when talking about movies, books, video games, and other interests. whatever– expresses openness to acceptance\nI usually like whatever’s on the radio. trending– currently popular\nThis group is trending online. indie– independent; not belonging to a major company\nI love this indie band. You probably haven’t heard of them. sell out– become too popular to be relatable\nI used to like that singer before they sold out. These are just a few examples of words and phrases to describe music, but there is much more available. Keep in mind that sub-genres, popularity, and other aspects of music help describe your musical interests more specifically. Combine these tips and describe your musical tastes like a native speaker with ease.","passages":[{"passage":"Bluegrass is one of the most diverse genres in the world of music.

Some of the best-known names in this genre are Metallica and Iron Maiden. Fans of this type of music are completely into it and their lifestyle is even based on Heavy Metal. - Rock n’ Roll\nRock n’ Roll has been one of the most popular music genres since the day it was invented. Let’s just say that the first traces of this music come from the 50s, but the popularity was significantly increased during the 70s and 80s. ACDC, G N R and many others have made this genre the ultimate choice for most people.

The term art music refers to classical traditions, including both contemporary and historical classical music forms. Art music exists in many parts of the world, it emphasizes formal styles that invite technical and detailed deconstruction and criticism, demand focused attention from the listener. In Western practice, art music is considered a written musical tradition, preserved in some form of music notation rather than being transmitted orally, by rote, or in recordings, as popular and traditional music are. Most western art music has been written down using the standard forms of music notation that evolved in Europe, beginning well before the Renaissance and reaching its maturity in the Romantic period. The identity of a \"work\" or \"piece\" of art music is defined by the notated version rather than by a particular performance, is associated with the composer rather than the performer. This is so in the case of western classical music. Art music may include certain forms of jazz, though some feel that jazz is a form of popular music. Sacred Christian music forms an important part of the classical music tradition and repertoire, but can be considered to have an identity of its own; the term popular music refers to any musical style accessible to the general public and disseminated by the mass media. Musicologist and popular music specialist Philip Tagg defined the notion in the light of sociocultural and economical aspects: Popular music, unlike art music, is conceived for mass distribution to large and socioculturally heterogeneous groups of listeners and distributed in non-written form, only possible in an industrial monetary economy where it becomes a commodity and in capitalist societies, subject to the laws of'free' enterprise... it should ideally sell as much as possible. Popular music is found on most commercial and public service radio stations, in most commercial music retailers and department stores, in movie and television soundtracks. It is noted on the Billboard charts and, in addition to singer-songwriters and composers, it involves music producers more than other genres do; the distinction between classical and popular music has sometimes been blurred in marginal areas such as minimalist music and light classics. Background music for films\/movies draws on both traditions. In this respect, music is like fiction, which draws a distinction between literary fiction and popular fiction, not always precise. Country music known as country and western, hillbilly music, is a genre of popular music that originated in the southern United States in the early 1920s; the polka is a Czech dance and genre of dance music familiar throughout Europe and the Americas. Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as \"rock and roll\" in the United States in the early 1950s, developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and particular\nA drum kit — called a drum set, trap set, or drums — is a collection of drums and other percussion instruments cymbals, which are set up on stands to be played by a single player, with drumsticks held in both hands, the feet operating pedals that control the hi-hat cymbal and the beater for the bass drum. A drum kit consists of a mix of drums and idiophones – most cymbals, but can include the woodblock and cowbell. In the 2000s, some kits include electronic instruments. Both hybrid and electronic kits are used. A standard modern kit, as used in popular music and taught in music schools, contains: A snare drum, mounted on a stand, placed between the player's knees and played with drum sticks A bass drum, played by a pedal operated by the right foot, which moves a felt-covered beater One or more toms, played with sticks or brushes A hi-hat, played with the sticks and closed with left foot pedal One or more cymbals, mounted on stands, played with the sticksAll of these are classified as non-pitched percussion, allowing the music to be scored using percussion notation, for which a loose semi-standardized form exists for both the drum kit and electronic drums. The drum kit is played while seated on a stool known as a throne.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:419affff-9961-4354-a850-ebb7fc7e3caa>"]},{"passage":"By Rachael Roberts\nMany students learning English have learned how to talk about their favorite songs and music genres, but don’t know much beyond describing what band they like or a broad description of the type of music they’re interested in. So, let’s take your English to the next level with some native-like ways to describe your musical interests. Try describing your favorite music genre more specifically with sub-genres. While it’s commonly known that there are many genres of music from pop to country, sub-genres are sub-categories within these genres that specify exactly what kind of music you’re talking about. Here are just a few examples but you can easily search online for more. New Wave Pop\nLofi Hip Hop\nUsing the time of the music’s release can help narrow down your musical interest. This is especially useful with genres like pop that can vary greatly from year to year. The type of music released by artists can also change a lot over time, so you can use different points in the career of a band or singer to describe the style of music you like. Here are some examples in sentences. I like listening to 80’s pop. I’m a big fan of early 2000’s alternative rock. Motown from the late 60’s was incredible. The early works of that band are the best. The mood and aesthetic of certain bands become a unique part of the listening experience. Some songs released by even the same artist can sound completely different from each other. Additionally, the aesthetic, or artistic image of a band can sometimes be just as important as the music. In fact, some aesthetics are so intertwined with the music, they merge to create their own sub-genre, like gothic rock. Here are some words to describe mood and aesthetic. Popularity plays a lot into describing music. For example, an important feature of enjoying pop music may be about what’s on top of the charts at the time. On the other hand, many rock music lovers prefer their favorite artists before they become popular. Here are some ways to describe the popularity of your favorite music. Many of these expressions can also be used when talking about movies, books, video games, and other interests. whatever– expresses openness to acceptance\nI usually like whatever’s on the radio. trending– currently popular\nThis group is trending online. indie– independent; not belonging to a major company\nI love this indie band. You probably haven’t heard of them. sell out– become too popular to be relatable\nI used to like that singer before they sold out. These are just a few examples of words and phrases to describe music, but there is much more available. Keep in mind that sub-genres, popularity, and other aspects of music help describe your musical interests more specifically. Combine these tips and describe your musical tastes like a native speaker with ease.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:01af8715-cb18-459c-8f20-ce26682c3249>"]}]}

This is standard XML. HTML allows for any case and converts tags and attribute names to lower case before use. The HTML language does not impose specific case requirements on attribute values. XHTML is XML-based, so it is case sensitive; however, all tag and attribute names are defined as lowercase. You are here\nThis page contains a listing of blogs about 3D technologies and artistry. This is the first of a multi-part post that examines the issues preventing easy integration of X3D into DOM. This post lists the specific issues and provides some background. It links to other posts that discuss the issue in more detail and in some cases provide possible solutions. This is part of a multi-part post that explores some ideas for integrating X3D into HTML5 DOM. It explores various options and their implications. The primary post is \"Integrating X3D into DOM - Issues\". HTML gained wide-spread acceptance because it was straight-forward and produced results even if you did write it perfectly - it is very forgiving. Of course, you get better results when written correctly, but you are never puzzling out what\nIEA102A INVALID PARAMETER\/FORMAT - RESPECIFY means1. HTML presents a unified environment to the web designer and user. This post introduces XSeen - a declarative language built on A-Frame and X3D to achieve the desire of a fully declarative 3D\/VR language that runs in the web browser. In this initial release the language supports some X3D and some A-Frame nodes and capabilities. It is possible to combine the two to produce results that are the available in either. I attended my first Silicon Valley VR Expo last week. It was very different than VRLA. As might be expected, this one is more focused on tech; though there were plenty of content discussions. Fortunately, the expo floor was not as loud as VRLA and I had many conversations with vendors. This is the fifth in a series discussing the next generation of X3D and addresses the needs and requirements for X3D for the display of 3D, AR, and VR content in the current ecosystem of display devices and environments. The 3D content is displaying in a larger ecosystem of including the user’s computer, browser, Internet, and originating server. As such it needs to work cooperatively within the environment and with other content already displaying in that environment. This is the fourth in a series discussing the next generation of X3D. Archiving and long-term storage has always been a strong point of X3D. The ability to read and play content from years or even decades ago makes it unsurpassed in the 3D world. X3D has human-readable formats that can be used for archiving so that the content does not require special software to unpack and display the file contents. It is important to keep the long-term storage and access capability while along X3D to stay current with advances in display technology. This is the third in a series discussing the next generation of X3D. The current architecture of X3D does not support the industry standards in modeling, archival, and user experience. It uses a single primary file with additional external resources loaded as needed including other X3D files or media (images, audio, video, and scripts). The capabilities made available in the X3D files are either insufficient (e.g., lack of deformable skin animation) or in conflict with the major display environment (e.g., Scripts). This post describes a systems architecture with implications for content architecture that addresses these issues.\n\nCego implements a relational and transactional database system with support for the SQL query language. The current release contains the most common database features for basic table manipulation and data retrieval. Indexes, foreign keys, views, and stored procedures are also implemented.

Eagle DNS is a powerful, multithreaded, platform independent DNS server written in Java. It is based on the very reliable and proven dnsjava API and has pluggable resolvers, zone providers, and plugins, making it very flexible. Release Notes: This release is more than a year in the making, with millions of DNS queries processed during several months of testing. It brings some significant improvements regarding scalability and flexibility. Resolvers are now pluggable just as ZoneProviders, adding another dimension compared to 1.0, which was a strictly authoritative server. Custom resolvers can now be added, and multiple resolvers can be used simultaneously configured as a chain. MakePAK is a command-line tool for creating Quake .PAK files. It is supposed to be paired with PhysicsFS, which can read Quake .PAK archives. It follows the GNU standards, providing a portable, consistent, and complete utility. Release Notes: This release fixes a major bug where the last byte of the file was excluded (which was especially problematic in binary files). Windows binaries are not currently provided, but may be added soon. Note: currently, the Linux RPMs\/DEBs are outdated. There are problems updating the openSUSE build service. Lzip is a lossless data compressor with a user interface similar to the one of gzip or bzip2. Lzip decompresses almost as fast as gzip and compresses more than bzip2, which makes it well suited for software distribution and data archiving. Lzip is a clean implementation of the LZMA algorithm. The Lzip file format is designed for long-term data archiving. It is clean, provides very safe four factor integrity checking, and is backed by the recovery capabilities of lziprecover. Release Notes: For large values of \"--match-length\", (high compression levels), the compression ratio has been slightly increased, and compression time has been reduced by up to 6%. VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics) is designed for the visualization and analysis of biological systems such as proteins, nucleic acids, lipid bilayer assemblies, etc. It may be used to view more general molecules, as VMD can read standard Protein Data Bank (PDB) files and display the contained structure.

VMD can be used to animate and analyze the trajectory of a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. In particular, VMD can act as a graphical front end for an external MD program by displaying and animating a molecule undergoing simulation on a remote computer. VMD uses OpenGL and OpenGL Programmable Shading Language for high performance rendering of large structures. Release Notes: Support for several new stereoscopic display modes. Improved export of molecular scenes to Wavefront OBJ format, for animation and rendering tools such as Autodesk Maya. Export of molecular scenes to X3D and X3DOM for interactive display of molecules in WebGL capable browsers. Many improvements to ray tracing and movie making features. Multi-GPU CUDA acceleration of quantum chemistry molecular orbital display. Initial support for OpenCL GPU acceleration and MPI parallel analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories. Many new and improved structure building and analysis plugins. ulatencyd is a scriptable daemon which constantly optimizes the Linux kernel for best user experience.

In this post I want to talk about some of the reasons to consider using Visual Studio next time you are working in Python. Doing Terrible Things To Your Code\nbelieve a key turning point in every professional programmer's working life is when you realize you are your own worst enemy, and the only way to mitigate that threat is to embrace it. Act like your own worst enemy. Break your UI. Break your code. Do terrible things to your software. This means programmers need a good working knowledge of at least the common mistakes, the frequent cases that average programmers tend to miss, to work against. You are tester zero.

I attended my first Silicon Valley VR Expo last week. It was very different than VRLA. As might be expected, this one is more focused on tech; though there were plenty of content discussions. Fortunately, the expo floor was not as loud as VRLA and I had many conversations with vendors. This is the fifth in a series discussing the next generation of X3D and addresses the needs and requirements for X3D for the display of 3D, AR, and VR content in the current ecosystem of display devices and environments. The 3D content is displaying in a larger ecosystem of including the user’s computer, browser, Internet, and originating server. As such it needs to work cooperatively within the environment and with other content already displaying in that environment. This is the fourth in a series discussing the next generation of X3D. Archiving and long-term storage has always been a strong point of X3D. The ability to read and play content from years or even decades ago makes it unsurpassed in the 3D world. X3D has human-readable formats that can be used for archiving so that the content does not require special software to unpack and display the file contents. It is important to keep the long-term storage and access capability while along X3D to stay current with advances in display technology. This is the third in a series discussing the next generation of X3D. The current architecture of X3D does not support the industry standards in modeling, archival, and user experience. It uses a single primary file with additional external resources loaded as needed including other X3D files or media (images, audio, video, and scripts). The capabilities made available in the X3D files are either insufficient (e.g., lack of deformable skin animation) or in conflict with the major display environment (e.g., Scripts).

It could also show up as not being able to do as much as you used to pre-pandemic. “Many people who previously coped well, are now less able to cope because of the multiple stressors generated by the pandemic,” wrote The Lancet Commission on Global Mental Health and Sustainable Development, according to the United Nations. - Of more than 10,000 survey respondents in early April, 53% said their productivity levels were impacted because of their mental health while working at home\n5.

There are many driving factors in your mental state, including genetics, character, personality, and relationships. The environment in your house is one, too. Here are some points to think about. Having a clean home helps create a peaceful environment. That is good for your mental well-being because you will not have to think about clutter all over the house. It gives you a sense of tranquility, helping you rest and relax. Having a well-lit home is also welcome, particularly for people suffering from depression. It is common for them to like dark environments, which could only aggravate their loneliness. This would also only get worse if you make it a habit. Allowing natural light in your house can make you feel happier and more positive. It can lift your mood, leading you to become more productive in whatever task you have at hand, whether it is spring-cleaning the house or preparing for the property maintenance franchise opportunities a friend has offered you. It is also essential that you get a good sleep every night. And the quality of sleep that you get to enjoy is also dependent on the environment of your bedroom. Parts of the Home\nAre you living with your family or friends? If you are living with your family, make sure you have a harmonious relationship. Eat meals together, spend time watching your favorite TV series, and talk at the end of the day, every day. Make it a point to spend quality time with each other. In case you are living with friends and have a hard time adjusting, you can talk to them to sort things out. Some parts of your home, meanwhile, can remind you of a breakup, like the flooring where you used to sit with your partner. This can affect your mood. If you are too affected, right now, it might help to go on a vacation for a while. Another aspect of the house that can influence your mood and health is the paint color. Happy colors like yellow, light pink, and other pastel hues promote a positive and delightful vibe. Dark colors can evoke too much emotion. Choose wisely. Home and Mental Health\nYour housing location can do a lot for your mental health, as well. You tend to feel good when you live in a peaceful neighborhood. On the other hand, living in a neighborhood where crime is prevalent and vandalism is an ongoing thing can scare you off. You can become paranoid and fearful for your life. Lastly, the environment of the house can affect not only your mental health but physical health, too. As mentioned above, the state of the neighborhood you belong to can affect your feelings. For example, some houses have harmful chemicals or metals because they are already old. You can get serious illnesses like lead poisoning. The condition of your mind is somehow affected by the house you live in. Choose to live in a safe, welcoming, and positive area if you are prone to get affected mentally. A beautiful home, even if it is small, can help you think of good things and focus on living well. Live in a place where you can have peace of mind.\n\nRenters are More Likely to Have Poor Health than Home Owners\nHomes play vital roles in our lives. Home is the place where we rest, spend time with family and friends and the place where we can be ourselves. The house or apartment where we live should feel like a home. When you consider how important a role our home has in our lives, it is not surprising that researchers have found a link between the homes we live in and our overall health. Recent research explored a connection between housing and health by using an objective indicator: C-reactive protein level (CRP) which is a marker found in blood connected to stress and infections. Researchers found that private renters have higher levels of CRP in their blood indicating that they have poorer health compared to homeowners. However, the poorer health of renters may reflect the lower quality of their homes. If the private renters were paying more for their homes they are more likely to be healthier which is a strong link between home quality and overall health. Most renters are not ready to pay too much for a home if it is not necessary simply because they are aware that this is not a long-term solution. That is the main reason why most renters do not live in fully equipped homes. Plus, there is a stress typical for home renters while those who own property are less likely to experience stress linked to housing. Owning a house is a big milestone in everyone’s life while renters feel they are just not there yet. Does Your Skin Affect Your Mental Health? Almost every bottle of oral acne medication comes with a large warning about the risks it might have on our mental health. Brand name Accutane has a label with a statement:\n“Accutane may cause depression, psychosis and, rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide, and aggressive and\/or violent behaviors.”\nThis is not just a myth, there have been a number of high-profile suicides related to acne medicine isotretinoin such as the death of Seamus Todd, the son of the actor Richard Todd, who committed suicide. Some studies have proved there is a link between the use of isotretinoin and depression and suicidal thoughts, it is still not clear whether mental health issues are caused by the drug or the severe acne condition, especially since acne can temporarily get worse after using the medicine. Recent researchers contradict that the medicine itself could lead to suicide and depression. Dermatologists and psychiatrists are paying close attention to any link that can be found between acne and depression especially among young people. The field called psychodermatology investigates how the mind affects our skin and vice versa, if skin conditions can affect our mind. However, the nature of skin and mind connection is far from clear. It is very difficult to study any potential link between a person’s physical and mental health. Some researchers have found the link between stress and skin conditions, but we are far from completely understanding the link between our skin and mental health. Mental Health Crisis Among Soldiers\nNew figures have shown that mental health emergencies account for one in ten air evacuation of military personnel. Among many other issues, soldiers often struggle with PTSD, depression, stress, and anxiety. The mental health issue is the second most common reason for medical evacuation among military personnel, right after limb injuries. More soldiers were evacuated for mental health issues than spinal injuries or heart problems. Evacuations can take place due to emergency treatment which often prevents servicemen and women from carrying out their military duties. Often after treatment in their country, they can return to operations abroad or stay home. The servicemen and women are often under a high risk of self-harm due to their mental health conditions. We often don’t pay too much attention to mental health issues in the army. In the UK, a Ministry of Defense spokesman said:\n“We are committed to the mental health of our service personnel and have increased funding in this area by £20 million. We have also launched an emergency mental health hotline and are working with experts and charities to tackle any perceived stigma around talking about mental health.”\nLet’s not forget that soldiers do need all the help they can get to adjust to a new life when they come back from countries devastated by war.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a massive increase in mental health issues across all genders, age groups and cultures. This is a problem that will increase and will probably get worse before it gets better. Many people go through life accepting their problems, seeing them as “normal” or as a an inevitable consequence of their job, family life or upbringing. However, mental health issues always start somewhere and increasing amounts of research is looking at the link between stress and more serious disorders which can follow. Researchers define stress as a physical, mental, or emotional response to events that causes bodily or mental tension. Simply put, stress is any outside force or event that has an effect on our body or mind. Modern life is full of hassles, deadlines, frustrations, and demands. For many people, stress is so commonplace that it has become a way of life. However, stress is not always bad. In small doses, it can help you perform under pressure and motivate you to do your best. But when you’re constantly running in emergency mode, your mind and body pay the price. Stress is a normal physical response to events that make you feel threatened or upset your balance in some way. When you sense danger – whether it’s real or imagined – the body’s defenses kick into high gear in a rapid, automatic process known as the “fight-or-flight” reaction, or the stress response. The stress response is coordinated through two mechanisms:\n1. changes in the activities of various brain regions and brain chemicals and\n2. changes in the activity of a hormonal system. The stress response is the body’s way of protecting you. When working properly, it helps you stay focused, energetic, and alert. In emergency situations, stress can save your life – giving you extra strength to defend yourself, for example, or spurring you to slam on the brakes to avoid an accident. The stress response also helps you rise to meet challenges. Stress is what keeps you on your toes during a presentation at work, sharpens your concentration when you’re attempting the game-winning free throw, or drives you to study for an exam when you’d rather be watching TV but beyond a certain point, stress stops being helpful and starts causing major damage to your health, your mood, your productivity, your relationships, and your quality of life. It is shocking to learn what stress is doing to our body and mind. According to Mental Health America (MHA), here is what stress can do to us:\n- The Brain:\n- Stress can cause headaches, sadness, lack of energy, nervousness, irritability, trouble concentrating, memory issues, difficulty sleeping, and even mental health disorders themselves. - The Heart:\n- If you are experiencing stress, you may have a faster heartbeat, heart palpitations, a rise in blood pressure, and an increased risk for high cholesterol and even heart attacks. - The Stomach:\n- The stomach can be affected by stress—nausea, aches, heartburn, weight gain, and appetite changes are some of the symptoms. - The Pancreas:\n- Stress can increase your risk for diabetes. - The Intestines:\n- Diarrhea, constipation, and other digestive problems can occur due to stress. - The Reproductive Organs:\n- For women, stress can cause irregular or painful periods and reduced sexual desire. In men, impotence, low sperm production, and reduced sexual desire may also occur. - Other Effects:\n- Other effects on your body due to stress may be acne, muscle aches, and a weakened immune system. Some women may also be at an increased risk for low bone density. According to the American Psychological Association, nearly 70% of Americans experience physical and mental symptoms of stress. A study that was also released in 2005 by the American Psychological Association presented some very startling stress related statistics. It found that the six leading causes of death at that time, accidents, suicide, lung ailments, heart disease, cancer, and cirrhosis of the liver, could all be linked back to stress. At that time stress-related issues were the reasons for a full two-thirds of visits to the family doctor. Sixty four percent of Americans were working on lowering the amount of stress that they dealt with on a daily basis.Speaking on a global scale stress touches nearly every home no matter how big or how small. According to a study that was done by the Foundation for Integrated Research In Mental Health in 2007 some numbers stood out.\n\nCleaning for Mental Health\nOctober 30, 2018\nEveryone does their best to keep up on household chores and cleaning, but clutter always finds a way to seep back in. It’s as if messes pop up out of nowhere sometimes, no matter how often clean. If you staring down another Saturday’s worth of cleaning in the Stamford apartments, then there is some good news you might find surprising. Leading psychological research as attributed clutter to stress and anxiety, but recent studies discovered that cleaning up messes actually has a positive benefit on your mental health. That’s right. If you want to destress, then pick up a cleaning rag and a duster. Here’s the science behind why cleaning is good for your health. The University of California gathered thirty couples for a study on stress hormones. Those who described their house as messy or chaotic displayed increased levels of cortisol, a steroid hormone produced in the adrenal gland in response to stress. The same study also found that women were more adversely affected by clutter than men. So, a messy home has a negative impact on your health. It only makes sense that decreasing the clutter would alleviate your buildup of cortisol, therefore being a healthy habit. However, there’s more to it than just that. The Mental Benefits\nAside from improving cleanliness, cleaning does have a positive impact on your mental health. A recent study by the British Journal of Sports Medicine proved that a mere twenty minutes of physical activity was enough to decrease stress levels, but a Scottish Health Survey proved that activity didn’t have to be a workout. Over 3,000 people surveyed reported that regular housework was enough to decrease anxiety and stress levels, with further research placing that decrease at around 20%. While cleaning isn’t a cure all, that percentage can work wonders on your daily level of stress. Did you know that anxiety and stress are linked to a shorter lifespan? A 2015 study in the U.K. found that a stressful work environment can take up to 33 years off your life. Most people have stressful jobs, but adding on the stress of a cluttered home could be even more detrimental. If you can clean for just twenty minutes a day, you can reduce the impact that stress has on your life. It gets even better, though. Vigorous cleaning (like washing the floors) is an outlet for negative emotions thanks to the energy your burn while scrubbing away. Individuals also reported having an easier time unwinding at the end of the day when their home was cleaned. Altogether, that means doing household chores after a rough day at the office is the perfect remedy. The Physical Benefits\nAnother study conducted by Indiana University’s Physical Activity Department looked at the impact a clean home had on both physical and mental health. Their findings on mental health coincided with the benefits found by previous studies, but they did find one interesting correlation between a cluttered home and an individual’s activity level. As it turn out, people with the cleanest homes are the most active. While the correlation is unclear, there’s something about clutter that causes people to lose motivation, choosing to sit down in front of the TV instead of go for a walk or hit the gym. Another benefit to a clean home is a lack of allergens waiting to attack your immune system. The longer you go without cleaning your home (really cleaning, not just dusting) the more polluted the air inside your home becomes. Compared to right outside your front door, your home’s air quality is often five times worse on any given day. That means more pollen, dust mites, dander, and other allergens hiding in plain sight. Regular cleaning your home is an excellent way to relieve stress, stay active, and feel your best by removing the pesky elements lingering in the air. Keeping up with such a rigorous cleaning schedule isn’t exactly easy, though. However, there are a few steps you can take to make this chore less taxing. De-Clutter for Good\nThe first step to de-cluttering your home is to cut back on the number of things you purchase. If you take a moment to think about it, how many items in your home are simply collecting dust? How many items do you own and never use? If you have a free weekend, then you might want to consider taking the time to sort through all of your belongings and sell or donate the items you don’t need. Closets are an excellent place to start, as are cupboards and any form of storage space.\n\nEveryone feels stressed from time to time. But what is stress? How does it affect your health? And what can you do about it? Stress is how the brain and body respond to any demand. Every type of stressor—such as exercise, work, school, significant life changes, or traumatic events—can be stressful. Stress can affect your health. It is essential to pay attention to how you deal with minor and significant stress events so that you know when to seek help. Below are 5 things you should know about stress and how you can relieve it. 1. Everyone is affected\nEveryone feels stressed from time to time. Some people may cope more efficiently or recover from stressful events more quickly than others. There are different types of stress—all of which carry physical and mental health risks. A stressor may be a one time or short-term occurrence, or it can be an occurrence that keeps happening over an extended period. Examples of stress include:\n- Routine pressures of work, school, family and other daily responsibilities\n- A sudden adverse change, such as losing a job, divorce, or illness\n- A traumatic experience such as a major accident, war, assault, or a natural disaster where people may be in danger of being seriously hurt or killed. People who experience traumatic stress often experience temporary symptoms of mental illness, but most recover naturally soon after. 2. Not all stress is severe\nStress can motivate people to prepare or perform, like when they need to take a test or interview for a new job. It can even be life-saving in some situations. In response to danger, your body prepares to face a threat or flee to safety. In these circumstances, your pulse quickens, you breathe faster, your muscles tense, your brain uses more oxygen and increases activity—all functions aimed at survival. 3. Long-term effects can harm your health\nHealth problems can occur if the stress response goes on for too long or becomes chronic, such as when the source of is constant, or if the reaction continues after the danger has subsided. With chronic stress, those same life-saving responses in your body can suppress immune, digestive, sleep, and reproductive systems, which may cause them to stop working usually. Different people are affected in different ways. For example, some people experience mainly digestive symptoms, while others may have headaches, sleeplessness, sadness, anger or irritability. People under chronic stress are prone to more frequent and severe viral infections, such as the flu or common cold. Routine stress may be the hardest type to notice at first. Because the source tends to be more constant than in cases of acute or traumatic stress, the body gets no clear signal to return to normal functioning. Over time, continued strain on your body may contribute to serious health problems, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and other illnesses, as well as mental disorders like depression or anxiety. 4. There are ways to manage stress\nThe effects of stress tend to build up over time. Taking practical steps to can reduce or prevent these results. The following are some tips that may help you to cope better:\n- Recognize the signs of your body’s response, such as difficulty sleeping, increased alcohol and other substance use, being easily angered, feeling depressed, and having low energy. - Talk to Your Doctor or Health Care Provider. Get proper health care for existing or new health problems. - Get Regular Exercise. Just 30 minutes per day of walking can help boost your mood and reduce stress. - Try a Relaxing Activity. Explore coping programs, which may incorporate meditation, yoga, tai chi, or other gentle exercises. For some related conditions, these approaches are used in addition to other forms of treatment. Schedule regular times for these and other healthy and relaxing activities. Learn more about these techniques on the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) website at (www.nccih.nih.gov\/health\/stress)\n- Set Goals and Priorities. Decide what must get done and what can wait, and learn to say no to new tasks if they are putting you on overload. Note what you have accomplished at the end of the day, not what you have been unable to do. - Stay Connected with people who can provide emotional and other support. Ask for help from friends, family, and community or religious organizations. - Consider a Clinical Trial. Researchers at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), NCCIH, and other research facilities across the country are studying the causes and effects of psychological stress, and stress management techniques.\n\nSource: Adapted from Family Medical Adviser, Reader’s Digest\nWhat is stress? Stress is something we all encounter at some time in our lives, no matter what our circumstances. It is an unavoidable part of being alive. When we are faced with change, or threatened or challenged in any way, we come under stress. How we respond varies from person to person. A situation that one person finds intolerable may be stimulating and exciting to another. Too little stimulation, resulting in boredom, can also cause problems, which is why some people may feel more stressed after they have retired from work than when they were doing a highly demanding job. Stress affects us not only mentally but can bring about physical changes too. In fact, our bodies’ response to stress clearly illustrates the way in which our mental health can be directly linked to physical problems. Animals respond to danger by turning to face the fight or fleeing. This is called the ‘fight or flight’ response. Human beings share this automatic bodily reaction, and we respond to emotional stress as if it were a physical threat. You may only be having an argument with a colleague at work, but you are physically ready for a life-or-death struggle with a lion. Your muscles grow tense, ready for action, your heart beats faster, your blood pressure goes up, you breathe faster and sweat more, and your mouth becomes dry. These physical reactions are caused by the release of adrenaline and other hormones into the bloodstream. The reason why different people react differently to stress is because the intensity of the hormone response varies from person to person, according to lifestyle and genetic make-up. Your personality affects how stressful you judge a situation to be and how you deal with it. A troubled childhood may make you more vulnerable to stress, while being in a supportive relationship or family situation is thought to give some protection from stress. Experiencing a certain amount of stress can result in a surge of energy that will help you to achieve your goals in life. Without it, you may not be alert enough to perform well or to make appropriate changes should any difficulties or obstacles arise. However, problems tend to occur when you are constantly reacting to stressful situations without taking, or feeling you are able to take, any action to counter their effects. When someone is under too much stress for too long, it can threaten their health and well-being. The resulting continual rise in levels of adrenaline can lead to the development of certain illnesses. These may be relatively minor such as insomnia, backache or headaches, but stress has also been identified as a contributory factor in several potentially life-threatening conditions, including high blood pressure and heart disease. Some people have a good awareness of their stress levels – even if they succumb to stress easily, they know how to recognize its symptoms and to deal with them effectively – while others fail to recognize their condition or try to cope by ignoring it. It is common for people affected by stress to turn to alcohol, cigarettes, tranquillizers or other drugs as a way of dealing with the problem. But such responses can eventually cause physical, emotional and behavioural problems, which can also affect their health and peace of mind. These problems can have an impact on relationships at home and in the workplace. Who is at risk for stress? In modern life, stress is most likely to be caused by worries concerning your job, finances, health, personal life or surroundings that make you feel under constant pressure. Generally speaking, stress arises from events that create a sense of anxiety, uncertainty or loss. In addition, a feeling of being out of control frequently accompanies such events. If you feel in control of your life, you will often still function well despite being subjected to a constant flow of highly demanding situations. Symptoms of stress\nStress shows itself in various ways. If you are under stress, you may notice a number of the following physical, emotional or behavioural signs. - Breathlessness or palpitations. - Muscle cramps, aches or spasms. - Constipation or diarrhea. - Headaches, migraines or backache. - Skin problems such as eczema or acne. - Tiredness or insomnia. - Panic attacks. - Frequent colds. - Irritability or impatience. - Anxiety and fear. - Anger or aggression. - Mood swings. - Inability to express or feel emotion. - Difficulty concentrating. - Problems making decisions. - Eating, smoking or drinking more.\n\nWhether it be a health crisis, job loss, death of a loved one, break up or other difficulty, we all must face and confront losses.

The truth is that chronic stress can be deadly if it persists for an extended time. If left untreated and uncontrolled, it can cause havoc on all aspects of your life. Stress, when not managed, can have an impact on your personal and professional lives. The Harmful Effects of Stress To Your Body\nWhile stress is intended to be a temporary reaction to distress, it is not intended to be a permanent state of being. Let’s look at why stress can be fatal if left untreated and unmanaged. It weakens the immune system\nHave you ever become ill as a result of overworking yourself or dealing with an emotional situation at home? Stress weakens immune system responses, and as a result, your body’s lymphocytes, also known as white blood cells, are reduced, rendering them unable to fight infection. According to Nadia Hasan, DO, a physician at Delancey Internal Medicine, “The lesser your lymphocyte levels, the more vulnerable you are to viruses such as the common cold.” When you are under stress, you are more vulnerable to common illnesses. People who manage their stress well are less likely to get the common cold, allergies, or the seasonal flu. Stress has a physiological impact on your body\nHigh levels of stress have been linked to a variety of health issues and illnesses. You are more likely to suffer from strokes, heart attacks, headaches and migraines, and other cardiovascular diseases if you do not have a system in place for dealing with and managing stress. When you are stressed, your blood pressure rises, your heart rate quickens, and you may experience other symptoms. Signs of Excessive Stress\nStress can cause a variety of physical and emotional symptoms. Most of the time, we are unaware that the symptoms we are experiencing are the result of stress. Excessive stress can result in a variety of mental and physical health problems. Here are some signs that you might be stressed:\n- Stiff neck or jaw\n- Sleep disorder\n- Constipation or diarrhea\n- Stomachache, diarrhea or constipation\n- Body aches and pains on a regular basis\n- Weight loss or gain\n- Lack of energy\n- Lack of focus\n- Weight gain or loss\nWays to Cope with Stress\nExercising can help you de-stress at any time. Physical activity, according to medical practitioners, is one of the best ways to reduce stress and maintain mental health. Endorphins are released into the brain when you exercise. The chemicals are antidepressants that act as stress buffers. When you spend some time at the gym or go for a walk or run, and you will not only feel happier but will also be able to sleep better. Practice meditation and mindfulness\nMeditation and mindfulness have been shown to improve a person’s stress level and ability to cope with stress. These practices entail setting aside at least five or ten minutes each day to spend in a quiet, distraction-free space. An important aspect of these practices is paying attention to your body’s natural breathing patterns. Relax by concentrating on your breathing. When we are stressed, we often forget to eat healthily. We consume large amounts of caffeine, alcohol, fatty snacks, and sugary foods. This may momentarily lessen your stress level, but it has long-term health consequences and may cause you certain health concerns. If you want to alleviate stress, it’s recommended to avoid these meals and eat healthily. Eat more organic fruits and vegetables and drink more water. Fish is abundant in omega-3 fatty acids and is beneficial for stress relief. Get enough sleep\nSadly, sleep deprivation is a major source of stress. If you don’t get enough sleep at night, your body won’t function effectively as it should. Lack of sleep throws your brain and body out of sync, and you become stressed. Thus, ensure you get about seven to eight hours of sleep every night. If stress keeps you awake at night, reduce your light, switch off the tv, and practice meditation. Getting enough sleep is one of the most effective stress relievers. It’s pretty important to notice and recognize stressful situations so that you can focus on how to deal with them. Hey Joyfreshers, how do you cope with stress? Let’s discuss them below!\n\nThe Negative Impact Of Stress [Infographic]\nIn 2020, the negative impact of stress can be felt in all areas of our lives. There is a profound and challenging struggle in understanding what is driving our stress, what its real impacts are, and ways we can manage our stress for our well-being. Having complementary daily strategies in place to manage and actively work to minimise stress is key to caring for your health in a holistic way that nurtures your long-term well-being. Why Is A Holistic Approach Necessary For Stress Management? Holistic steps play a significant role in approaching a health issue like stress because the triggers are genuinely multifaceted. Additionally, the impacts are far-reaching therefore dynamic methodologies can help you to work towards a healthier life. In fact, HealthKnowledge.org.uk says that, “Mental health and physical health are inextricably linked, with evidence for a strong relationship between the two accumulating over recent decades and challenging the historical notion of mind-body duality.” They go further to say that public mental health has been recognised as integral to public health, therefore emphasising the New Economics Foundation’s five evidence-based actions individuals can take for their well-being: connect, be active, take notice, keep learning, and give. A comprehensive combination of mindfulness, rest, rejuvenation, prioritising your physical health through diet and exercise, specialist and community support, and lifestyle planning are a starting point for you to approach handling stress as a well-being strategy rather than a stress strategy alone.

It could also show up as not being able to do as much as you used to pre-pandemic. “Many people who previously coped well, are now less able to cope because of the multiple stressors generated by the pandemic,” wrote The Lancet Commission on Global Mental Health and Sustainable Development, according to the United Nations. - Of more than 10,000 survey respondents in early April, 53% said their productivity levels were impacted because of their mental health while working at home\n5. Increased Substance Use\nThough it’s not the healthiest way to manage your mental health, it’s also not surprising that substance use has increased due to the pandemic. If you or a loved one is affected by addiction and need help, you can call SAMHSA’s hotline at 1-800-662-4357. - Approximately 20% of Canadians between the ages of 15 and 49 have been drinking more alcohol during the pandemic\n- A COVID-19 survey found 25% of respondents reported binge drinking at least once in the past week. One out of five said they used prescription drugs for non-prescription reasons and one out of seven used illicit drugs\n6. Parenting Is Hard\nAll memes and good fun aside, the truth underlying those hilarious parenting memes is that parenting right now is hard. With schools closed, parents have taken on a much more intensive role in their child’s day-to-day life, all while being stuck at home more than ever. It’s a lot, and it’s taking its toll. - 20% of parents with children were struggling with their mental health, compared to 13% of those without young kids in the house\n- 31% of women with children working full-time felt they had more on their plate than they could handle compared to 13% of men\n- Women are spending 7.4 more hours per week on childcare than men, Latinx and Black women spend 4 to 12 hours more each week than white women and single mothers another 7 hours more than women overall\n7. Work Is Hard\nThere’s no question losing your job because of the COVID-19 pandemic is devastating. So far, 36.5 million Americans have filed for unemployment. The economic uncertainty and very real consequences — like fear of losing your home or not being able to feed your family — impact mental health. But it turns out even if you’re working from home, it can have a negative impact on your mental health. - 18% of Americans who were still working as of April 15 were actually more likely to say they were experiencing negative emotional effects compared to 12% of those not working\n- 45% of employees said they were burned out — and 25% said it was due to COVID-19\n- The top reasons for work-related burnout during COVID-19 included: 26.7% due to no home-work life balance, 20.5% because of an unmanageable workload and 18.8% because of job security concerns\n- Only 52% of employees working from home said their employer was more flexible because of the pandemic while only 31% said a manager or human resources staff member checked on their well-being\n8. Worried About Mental vs. Physical Health\nSome experts have called the mental health impact of COVID-19 a second wave of the pandemic, and the numbers don’t lie. For many people, the mental health consequences of COVID-19 — and everything that comes with it — is a bigger stressor than their physical health. - In mid-April, 15% of Gallup survey participants said their mental health was most impacted by COVID-19, compared to 9% who said their financial health was impacted and 6% who said their physical health\nHelp Is Available\nIf you’re struggling with your mental health during COVID-19, you’re not alone.

And no matter what you’re experiencing, know you’re not alone. This is hard and it’s OK to ask for help. “I’m learning it is OK to ask for help even during this pandemic. Especially during this pandemic,” wrote Mighty contributor Tori S., adding:\nRight now is the time to be there for each other. To show our vulnerabilities, our struggles, the moments when we aren’t so ‘put-together.’ … I am learning that it is OK to not be OK; it is OK to show that I am not OK, and it is more than OK to ask for help when I need it.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:634bf9c4-77b5-4853-be3d-32e1351b92b5>"]},{"passage":"Do you believe that your home can have an impact on your mental health? There are many driving factors in your mental state, including genetics, character, personality, and relationships. The environment in your house is one, too. Here are some points to think about. Having a clean home helps create a peaceful environment. That is good for your mental well-being because you will not have to think about clutter all over the house. It gives you a sense of tranquility, helping you rest and relax. Having a well-lit home is also welcome, particularly for people suffering from depression. It is common for them to like dark environments, which could only aggravate their loneliness. This would also only get worse if you make it a habit. Allowing natural light in your house can make you feel happier and more positive. It can lift your mood, leading you to become more productive in whatever task you have at hand, whether it is spring-cleaning the house or preparing for the property maintenance franchise opportunities a friend has offered you. It is also essential that you get a good sleep every night. And the quality of sleep that you get to enjoy is also dependent on the environment of your bedroom. Parts of the Home\nAre you living with your family or friends? If you are living with your family, make sure you have a harmonious relationship. Eat meals together, spend time watching your favorite TV series, and talk at the end of the day, every day. Make it a point to spend quality time with each other. In case you are living with friends and have a hard time adjusting, you can talk to them to sort things out. Some parts of your home, meanwhile, can remind you of a breakup, like the flooring where you used to sit with your partner. This can affect your mood. If you are too affected, right now, it might help to go on a vacation for a while. Another aspect of the house that can influence your mood and health is the paint color. Happy colors like yellow, light pink, and other pastel hues promote a positive and delightful vibe. Dark colors can evoke too much emotion. Choose wisely. Home and Mental Health\nYour housing location can do a lot for your mental health, as well. You tend to feel good when you live in a peaceful neighborhood. On the other hand, living in a neighborhood where crime is prevalent and vandalism is an ongoing thing can scare you off. You can become paranoid and fearful for your life. Lastly, the environment of the house can affect not only your mental health but physical health, too. As mentioned above, the state of the neighborhood you belong to can affect your feelings. For example, some houses have harmful chemicals or metals because they are already old. You can get serious illnesses like lead poisoning. The condition of your mind is somehow affected by the house you live in. Choose to live in a safe, welcoming, and positive area if you are prone to get affected mentally. A beautiful home, even if it is small, can help you think of good things and focus on living well. Live in a place where you can have peace of mind.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:068fded4-f2d5-48b6-9bd7-65181a9f5a05>"]},{"passage":"Renters are More Likely to Have Poor Health than Home Owners\nHomes play vital roles in our lives. Home is the place where we rest, spend time with family and friends and the place where we can be ourselves. The house or apartment where we live should feel like a home. When you consider how important a role our home has in our lives, it is not surprising that researchers have found a link between the homes we live in and our overall health. Recent research explored a connection between housing and health by using an objective indicator: C-reactive protein level (CRP) which is a marker found in blood connected to stress and infections. Researchers found that private renters have higher levels of CRP in their blood indicating that they have poorer health compared to homeowners. However, the poorer health of renters may reflect the lower quality of their homes. If the private renters were paying more for their homes they are more likely to be healthier which is a strong link between home quality and overall health. Most renters are not ready to pay too much for a home if it is not necessary simply because they are aware that this is not a long-term solution. That is the main reason why most renters do not live in fully equipped homes. Plus, there is a stress typical for home renters while those who own property are less likely to experience stress linked to housing. Owning a house is a big milestone in everyone’s life while renters feel they are just not there yet. Does Your Skin Affect Your Mental Health? Almost every bottle of oral acne medication comes with a large warning about the risks it might have on our mental health. Brand name Accutane has a label with a statement:\n“Accutane may cause depression, psychosis and, rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide, and aggressive and\/or violent behaviors.”\nThis is not just a myth, there have been a number of high-profile suicides related to acne medicine isotretinoin such as the death of Seamus Todd, the son of the actor Richard Todd, who committed suicide. Some studies have proved there is a link between the use of isotretinoin and depression and suicidal thoughts, it is still not clear whether mental health issues are caused by the drug or the severe acne condition, especially since acne can temporarily get worse after using the medicine. Recent researchers contradict that the medicine itself could lead to suicide and depression. Dermatologists and psychiatrists are paying close attention to any link that can be found between acne and depression especially among young people. The field called psychodermatology investigates how the mind affects our skin and vice versa, if skin conditions can affect our mind. However, the nature of skin and mind connection is far from clear. It is very difficult to study any potential link between a person’s physical and mental health. Some researchers have found the link between stress and skin conditions, but we are far from completely understanding the link between our skin and mental health. Mental Health Crisis Among Soldiers\nNew figures have shown that mental health emergencies account for one in ten air evacuation of military personnel. Among many other issues, soldiers often struggle with PTSD, depression, stress, and anxiety. The mental health issue is the second most common reason for medical evacuation among military personnel, right after limb injuries. More soldiers were evacuated for mental health issues than spinal injuries or heart problems. Evacuations can take place due to emergency treatment which often prevents servicemen and women from carrying out their military duties. Often after treatment in their country, they can return to operations abroad or stay home. The servicemen and women are often under a high risk of self-harm due to their mental health conditions. We often don’t pay too much attention to mental health issues in the army. In the UK, a Ministry of Defense spokesman said:\n“We are committed to the mental health of our service personnel and have increased funding in this area by £20 million. We have also launched an emergency mental health hotline and are working with experts and charities to tackle any perceived stigma around talking about mental health.”\nLet’s not forget that soldiers do need all the help they can get to adjust to a new life when they come back from countries devastated by war.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:7bd5efe6-f7ad-47a7-bade-485e319ff0a9>"]},{"passage":"In recent years, there has been a massive increase in mental health issues across all genders, age groups and cultures. This is a problem that will increase and will probably get worse before it gets better. Many people go through life accepting their problems, seeing them as “normal” or as a an inevitable consequence of their job, family life or upbringing. However, mental health issues always start somewhere and increasing amounts of research is looking at the link between stress and more serious disorders which can follow. Researchers define stress as a physical, mental, or emotional response to events that causes bodily or mental tension. Simply put, stress is any outside force or event that has an effect on our body or mind. Modern life is full of hassles, deadlines, frustrations, and demands. For many people, stress is so commonplace that it has become a way of life. However, stress is not always bad. In small doses, it can help you perform under pressure and motivate you to do your best. But when you’re constantly running in emergency mode, your mind and body pay the price. Stress is a normal physical response to events that make you feel threatened or upset your balance in some way. When you sense danger – whether it’s real or imagined – the body’s defenses kick into high gear in a rapid, automatic process known as the “fight-or-flight” reaction, or the stress response. The stress response is coordinated through two mechanisms:\n1. changes in the activities of various brain regions and brain chemicals and\n2. changes in the activity of a hormonal system. The stress response is the body’s way of protecting you. When working properly, it helps you stay focused, energetic, and alert. In emergency situations, stress can save your life – giving you extra strength to defend yourself, for example, or spurring you to slam on the brakes to avoid an accident. The stress response also helps you rise to meet challenges. Stress is what keeps you on your toes during a presentation at work, sharpens your concentration when you’re attempting the game-winning free throw, or drives you to study for an exam when you’d rather be watching TV but beyond a certain point, stress stops being helpful and starts causing major damage to your health, your mood, your productivity, your relationships, and your quality of life. It is shocking to learn what stress is doing to our body and mind. According to Mental Health America (MHA), here is what stress can do to us:\n- The Brain:\n- Stress can cause headaches, sadness, lack of energy, nervousness, irritability, trouble concentrating, memory issues, difficulty sleeping, and even mental health disorders themselves. - The Heart:\n- If you are experiencing stress, you may have a faster heartbeat, heart palpitations, a rise in blood pressure, and an increased risk for high cholesterol and even heart attacks. - The Stomach:\n- The stomach can be affected by stress—nausea, aches, heartburn, weight gain, and appetite changes are some of the symptoms. - The Pancreas:\n- Stress can increase your risk for diabetes. - The Intestines:\n- Diarrhea, constipation, and other digestive problems can occur due to stress. - The Reproductive Organs:\n- For women, stress can cause irregular or painful periods and reduced sexual desire. In men, impotence, low sperm production, and reduced sexual desire may also occur. - Other Effects:\n- Other effects on your body due to stress may be acne, muscle aches, and a weakened immune system. Some women may also be at an increased risk for low bone density. According to the American Psychological Association, nearly 70% of Americans experience physical and mental symptoms of stress. A study that was also released in 2005 by the American Psychological Association presented some very startling stress related statistics. It found that the six leading causes of death at that time, accidents, suicide, lung ailments, heart disease, cancer, and cirrhosis of the liver, could all be linked back to stress. At that time stress-related issues were the reasons for a full two-thirds of visits to the family doctor. Sixty four percent of Americans were working on lowering the amount of stress that they dealt with on a daily basis.Speaking on a global scale stress touches nearly every home no matter how big or how small. According to a study that was done by the Foundation for Integrated Research In Mental Health in 2007 some numbers stood out.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:eb6416b4-dab6-46f6-bb92-3f1e16e2d2fb>"]},{"passage":"Cleaning for Mental Health\nOctober 30, 2018\nEveryone does their best to keep up on household chores and cleaning, but clutter always finds a way to seep back in. It’s as if messes pop up out of nowhere sometimes, no matter how often clean. If you staring down another Saturday’s worth of cleaning in the Stamford apartments, then there is some good news you might find surprising. Leading psychological research as attributed clutter to stress and anxiety, but recent studies discovered that cleaning up messes actually has a positive benefit on your mental health. That’s right. If you want to destress, then pick up a cleaning rag and a duster. Here’s the science behind why cleaning is good for your health. The University of California gathered thirty couples for a study on stress hormones. Those who described their house as messy or chaotic displayed increased levels of cortisol, a steroid hormone produced in the adrenal gland in response to stress. The same study also found that women were more adversely affected by clutter than men. So, a messy home has a negative impact on your health. It only makes sense that decreasing the clutter would alleviate your buildup of cortisol, therefore being a healthy habit. However, there’s more to it than just that. The Mental Benefits\nAside from improving cleanliness, cleaning does have a positive impact on your mental health. A recent study by the British Journal of Sports Medicine proved that a mere twenty minutes of physical activity was enough to decrease stress levels, but a Scottish Health Survey proved that activity didn’t have to be a workout. Over 3,000 people surveyed reported that regular housework was enough to decrease anxiety and stress levels, with further research placing that decrease at around 20%. While cleaning isn’t a cure all, that percentage can work wonders on your daily level of stress. Did you know that anxiety and stress are linked to a shorter lifespan? A 2015 study in the U.K. found that a stressful work environment can take up to 33 years off your life. Most people have stressful jobs, but adding on the stress of a cluttered home could be even more detrimental. If you can clean for just twenty minutes a day, you can reduce the impact that stress has on your life. It gets even better, though. Vigorous cleaning (like washing the floors) is an outlet for negative emotions thanks to the energy your burn while scrubbing away. Individuals also reported having an easier time unwinding at the end of the day when their home was cleaned. Altogether, that means doing household chores after a rough day at the office is the perfect remedy. The Physical Benefits\nAnother study conducted by Indiana University’s Physical Activity Department looked at the impact a clean home had on both physical and mental health. Their findings on mental health coincided with the benefits found by previous studies, but they did find one interesting correlation between a cluttered home and an individual’s activity level. As it turn out, people with the cleanest homes are the most active. While the correlation is unclear, there’s something about clutter that causes people to lose motivation, choosing to sit down in front of the TV instead of go for a walk or hit the gym. Another benefit to a clean home is a lack of allergens waiting to attack your immune system. The longer you go without cleaning your home (really cleaning, not just dusting) the more polluted the air inside your home becomes. Compared to right outside your front door, your home’s air quality is often five times worse on any given day. That means more pollen, dust mites, dander, and other allergens hiding in plain sight. Regular cleaning your home is an excellent way to relieve stress, stay active, and feel your best by removing the pesky elements lingering in the air. Keeping up with such a rigorous cleaning schedule isn’t exactly easy, though. However, there are a few steps you can take to make this chore less taxing. De-Clutter for Good\nThe first step to de-cluttering your home is to cut back on the number of things you purchase. If you take a moment to think about it, how many items in your home are simply collecting dust? How many items do you own and never use? If you have a free weekend, then you might want to consider taking the time to sort through all of your belongings and sell or donate the items you don’t need. Closets are an excellent place to start, as are cupboards and any form of storage space.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:17b68d11-c02d-4f5a-b36e-0056e31b02bb>"]},{"passage":"Everyone feels stressed from time to time. But what is stress? How does it affect your health? And what can you do about it? Stress is how the brain and body respond to any demand. Every type of stressor—such as exercise, work, school, significant life changes, or traumatic events—can be stressful. Stress can affect your health. It is essential to pay attention to how you deal with minor and significant stress events so that you know when to seek help. Below are 5 things you should know about stress and how you can relieve it. 1. Everyone is affected\nEveryone feels stressed from time to time. Some people may cope more efficiently or recover from stressful events more quickly than others. There are different types of stress—all of which carry physical and mental health risks. A stressor may be a one time or short-term occurrence, or it can be an occurrence that keeps happening over an extended period. Examples of stress include:\n- Routine pressures of work, school, family and other daily responsibilities\n- A sudden adverse change, such as losing a job, divorce, or illness\n- A traumatic experience such as a major accident, war, assault, or a natural disaster where people may be in danger of being seriously hurt or killed. People who experience traumatic stress often experience temporary symptoms of mental illness, but most recover naturally soon after. 2. Not all stress is severe\nStress can motivate people to prepare or perform, like when they need to take a test or interview for a new job. It can even be life-saving in some situations. In response to danger, your body prepares to face a threat or flee to safety. In these circumstances, your pulse quickens, you breathe faster, your muscles tense, your brain uses more oxygen and increases activity—all functions aimed at survival. 3. Long-term effects can harm your health\nHealth problems can occur if the stress response goes on for too long or becomes chronic, such as when the source of is constant, or if the reaction continues after the danger has subsided. With chronic stress, those same life-saving responses in your body can suppress immune, digestive, sleep, and reproductive systems, which may cause them to stop working usually. Different people are affected in different ways. For example, some people experience mainly digestive symptoms, while others may have headaches, sleeplessness, sadness, anger or irritability. People under chronic stress are prone to more frequent and severe viral infections, such as the flu or common cold. Routine stress may be the hardest type to notice at first. Because the source tends to be more constant than in cases of acute or traumatic stress, the body gets no clear signal to return to normal functioning. Over time, continued strain on your body may contribute to serious health problems, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and other illnesses, as well as mental disorders like depression or anxiety. 4. There are ways to manage stress\nThe effects of stress tend to build up over time. Taking practical steps to can reduce or prevent these results. The following are some tips that may help you to cope better:\n- Recognize the signs of your body’s response, such as difficulty sleeping, increased alcohol and other substance use, being easily angered, feeling depressed, and having low energy. - Talk to Your Doctor or Health Care Provider. Get proper health care for existing or new health problems. - Get Regular Exercise. Just 30 minutes per day of walking can help boost your mood and reduce stress. - Try a Relaxing Activity. Explore coping programs, which may incorporate meditation, yoga, tai chi, or other gentle exercises. For some related conditions, these approaches are used in addition to other forms of treatment. Schedule regular times for these and other healthy and relaxing activities. Learn more about these techniques on the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) website at (www.nccih.nih.gov\/health\/stress)\n- Set Goals and Priorities. Decide what must get done and what can wait, and learn to say no to new tasks if they are putting you on overload. Note what you have accomplished at the end of the day, not what you have been unable to do. - Stay Connected with people who can provide emotional and other support. Ask for help from friends, family, and community or religious organizations. - Consider a Clinical Trial. Researchers at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), NCCIH, and other research facilities across the country are studying the causes and effects of psychological stress, and stress management techniques.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:93076841-e42d-409d-b2b6-17c9aefd0a4b>"]},{"passage":"Source: Adapted from Family Medical Adviser, Reader’s Digest\nWhat is stress? Stress is something we all encounter at some time in our lives, no matter what our circumstances. It is an unavoidable part of being alive. When we are faced with change, or threatened or challenged in any way, we come under stress. How we respond varies from person to person. A situation that one person finds intolerable may be stimulating and exciting to another. Too little stimulation, resulting in boredom, can also cause problems, which is why some people may feel more stressed after they have retired from work than when they were doing a highly demanding job. Stress affects us not only mentally but can bring about physical changes too. In fact, our bodies’ response to stress clearly illustrates the way in which our mental health can be directly linked to physical problems. Animals respond to danger by turning to face the fight or fleeing. This is called the ‘fight or flight’ response. Human beings share this automatic bodily reaction, and we respond to emotional stress as if it were a physical threat. You may only be having an argument with a colleague at work, but you are physically ready for a life-or-death struggle with a lion. Your muscles grow tense, ready for action, your heart beats faster, your blood pressure goes up, you breathe faster and sweat more, and your mouth becomes dry. These physical reactions are caused by the release of adrenaline and other hormones into the bloodstream. The reason why different people react differently to stress is because the intensity of the hormone response varies from person to person, according to lifestyle and genetic make-up. Your personality affects how stressful you judge a situation to be and how you deal with it. A troubled childhood may make you more vulnerable to stress, while being in a supportive relationship or family situation is thought to give some protection from stress. Experiencing a certain amount of stress can result in a surge of energy that will help you to achieve your goals in life. Without it, you may not be alert enough to perform well or to make appropriate changes should any difficulties or obstacles arise. However, problems tend to occur when you are constantly reacting to stressful situations without taking, or feeling you are able to take, any action to counter their effects. When someone is under too much stress for too long, it can threaten their health and well-being. The resulting continual rise in levels of adrenaline can lead to the development of certain illnesses. These may be relatively minor such as insomnia, backache or headaches, but stress has also been identified as a contributory factor in several potentially life-threatening conditions, including high blood pressure and heart disease. Some people have a good awareness of their stress levels – even if they succumb to stress easily, they know how to recognize its symptoms and to deal with them effectively – while others fail to recognize their condition or try to cope by ignoring it. It is common for people affected by stress to turn to alcohol, cigarettes, tranquillizers or other drugs as a way of dealing with the problem. But such responses can eventually cause physical, emotional and behavioural problems, which can also affect their health and peace of mind. These problems can have an impact on relationships at home and in the workplace. Who is at risk for stress? In modern life, stress is most likely to be caused by worries concerning your job, finances, health, personal life or surroundings that make you feel under constant pressure. Generally speaking, stress arises from events that create a sense of anxiety, uncertainty or loss. In addition, a feeling of being out of control frequently accompanies such events. If you feel in control of your life, you will often still function well despite being subjected to a constant flow of highly demanding situations. Symptoms of stress\nStress shows itself in various ways. If you are under stress, you may notice a number of the following physical, emotional or behavioural signs. - Breathlessness or palpitations. - Muscle cramps, aches or spasms. - Constipation or diarrhea. - Headaches, migraines or backache. - Skin problems such as eczema or acne. - Tiredness or insomnia. - Panic attacks. - Frequent colds. - Irritability or impatience. - Anxiety and fear. - Anger or aggression. - Mood swings. - Inability to express or feel emotion. - Difficulty concentrating. - Problems making decisions. - Eating, smoking or drinking more.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:7c60b7e4-307c-4cb9-af94-d2eaab83200e>"]},{"passage":"Whether it be a health crisis, job loss, death of a loved one, break up or other difficulty, we all must face and confront losses.

The truth is that chronic stress can be deadly if it persists for an extended time. If left untreated and uncontrolled, it can cause havoc on all aspects of your life. Stress, when not managed, can have an impact on your personal and professional lives. The Harmful Effects of Stress To Your Body\nWhile stress is intended to be a temporary reaction to distress, it is not intended to be a permanent state of being. Let’s look at why stress can be fatal if left untreated and unmanaged. It weakens the immune system\nHave you ever become ill as a result of overworking yourself or dealing with an emotional situation at home? Stress weakens immune system responses, and as a result, your body’s lymphocytes, also known as white blood cells, are reduced, rendering them unable to fight infection. According to Nadia Hasan, DO, a physician at Delancey Internal Medicine, “The lesser your lymphocyte levels, the more vulnerable you are to viruses such as the common cold.” When you are under stress, you are more vulnerable to common illnesses. People who manage their stress well are less likely to get the common cold, allergies, or the seasonal flu. Stress has a physiological impact on your body\nHigh levels of stress have been linked to a variety of health issues and illnesses. You are more likely to suffer from strokes, heart attacks, headaches and migraines, and other cardiovascular diseases if you do not have a system in place for dealing with and managing stress. When you are stressed, your blood pressure rises, your heart rate quickens, and you may experience other symptoms. Signs of Excessive Stress\nStress can cause a variety of physical and emotional symptoms. Most of the time, we are unaware that the symptoms we are experiencing are the result of stress. Excessive stress can result in a variety of mental and physical health problems. Here are some signs that you might be stressed:\n- Stiff neck or jaw\n- Sleep disorder\n- Constipation or diarrhea\n- Stomachache, diarrhea or constipation\n- Body aches and pains on a regular basis\n- Weight loss or gain\n- Lack of energy\n- Lack of focus\n- Weight gain or loss\nWays to Cope with Stress\nExercising can help you de-stress at any time. Physical activity, according to medical practitioners, is one of the best ways to reduce stress and maintain mental health. Endorphins are released into the brain when you exercise. The chemicals are antidepressants that act as stress buffers. When you spend some time at the gym or go for a walk or run, and you will not only feel happier but will also be able to sleep better. Practice meditation and mindfulness\nMeditation and mindfulness have been shown to improve a person’s stress level and ability to cope with stress. These practices entail setting aside at least five or ten minutes each day to spend in a quiet, distraction-free space. An important aspect of these practices is paying attention to your body’s natural breathing patterns. Relax by concentrating on your breathing. When we are stressed, we often forget to eat healthily. We consume large amounts of caffeine, alcohol, fatty snacks, and sugary foods. This may momentarily lessen your stress level, but it has long-term health consequences and may cause you certain health concerns. If you want to alleviate stress, it’s recommended to avoid these meals and eat healthily. Eat more organic fruits and vegetables and drink more water. Fish is abundant in omega-3 fatty acids and is beneficial for stress relief. Get enough sleep\nSadly, sleep deprivation is a major source of stress. If you don’t get enough sleep at night, your body won’t function effectively as it should. Lack of sleep throws your brain and body out of sync, and you become stressed. Thus, ensure you get about seven to eight hours of sleep every night. If stress keeps you awake at night, reduce your light, switch off the tv, and practice meditation. Getting enough sleep is one of the most effective stress relievers. It’s pretty important to notice and recognize stressful situations so that you can focus on how to deal with them.

It is completely reasonable to let evaluators know that you’d like a few minutes at the end of the session to get a sense of what they think. Always take notes. You may be more tense than you realize, and it may be hard to remember exactly what you did or didn’t hear. Ask to have unfamiliar terms spelled out and explained and request sources of information you can consult. If you’ve had a full multi-specialty evaluation done, consider making an appointment to come back in, sit down, and discuss the results. Keep a notebook. As time goes by, you will think of questions you want to ask, observations about your child that seem significant, ideas for further assessment or therapy. Write them all down in a notebook. There you can also make note of the specialists you see, the tests they do, the information they give. Jot down phone numbers of programs or specialists you learn about from other parents, as well as contact data for someone who isn’t that helpful now but may be in a few years. A notebook will help you track your child and your own understanding. It will also help you use your time with the specialists to ask the questions you’ve been wanting to bring up. Trust your instincts. Go into this process with an open mind but also with a healthy degree of skepticism. If someone tells you something that absolutely does not fit with your sense of your child, consider it objectively. If it’s nonsense, forget it. Don’t let someone who can’t answer questions to your satisfaction pursue a long-term therapeutic relationship with your child, no matter how grand or glorious his degrees or reception room. Don’t expect a “eureka” moment. We’ll say it again because it’s so important: By and large, quirky kids don’t fit neatly into diagnostic categories. The ongoing process of having your child assessed and considering different diagnoses can be valuable if it points the way to helping your child. Still, it’s probably not going to yield a single, illuminating conclusion when you find out what’s “really” going on. Some specialists or clinics will give almost anyone a diagnosis. If you look hard and long enough, you will come across someone who will pin a label on your child—perhaps because it’s the same label everybody gets at that particular clinic. Be especially wary of labels that carry immediate recommendations for expensive therapists. Don’t let anyone prey on your desire to help your child. It’s worth getting a second opinion or discussing the recommendation with your own pediatrician. Most of the professionals you will encounter as you look into assessment and diagnosis will be honorable. It must be said, however, that there is something of an industry out there in providing diagnoses and therapies to kids with developmental variations. This brings us, once again, to our preference for the academic medical center. Finally, don’t forget that the point of all this—the workup, the testing, the consideration of your child by multiple experts—is not to come up with the right label, the right name, the right answer on some cosmic medical-student exam. It’s to help your child—and to help you help your child. Adapted from Quirky Kids (Ballantine), by Perri Klass, M.D., and Eileen Costello, M.D. Reprinted with permission from Random House.

The structure and level of aggrevation the child slips into this part of the assessment can be quite revealing and helpful in planning intervention. Two common examples of projectives are sentence completion tasks and standardized ink blot instruments. Diagnostic interview: A comprehensive interview with the child provides a wealth of strategic information. I happen to use a 155 question interview that I developed for this purpose (although it’s not always necessary to ask them all). The interview captures the youngster’s take on peer relationships, school functioning, factors of home and community and, of course, self. It samples their concerns in their terms, providing insight to areas where they would be most receptive to intervention. All this information is then complied into a comprehensive report that outlines the findings, provides a diagnosis (if there is one), and offers recommendations for intervention. The cost of an assessment like this ranges from a few hundred dollars to well over $1,000. Health insurance generally covers some, if not all, of the expense. Who can do these evaluations? Psychologists can, as well as anyone else trained and licensed or certified to do all components of the assessment. If your child’s oppositional and defiant behavior is causing them to have serious trouble progressing through school, you might ask the school to do an assessment. They have folks on staff who do this sort of thing all the time. They usually have at least one doctorate level psychologist on staff or as a consultant to help with the tougher challenges. Large counties often have a county psychological board (check the phone book) that can refer specialists who work with children. Also, a department of psychology or counseling of a nearby university (universities offer graduate training) might provide assistance or direction. In some cases, they may provide actual counseling or therapy services through their lab programs. Although the services are being provided by students, they are supervised, and they are usually motivated to do a good job. You don’t have much to lose, and the cost is minmal (like free, if they need kids). Keep in mind also that school counselors are required to maintain a resource list as part of their Crisis Response Plan. Ask them; they can probably help directly, or initiate a referral. Then, of course, there’s always the phone book. I believe it is best to find someone who specializes in children and adolescents. Who should do the counseling or therapy? For obvious reasons, it helps a lot if it is the same person who did the assessment. Rapport is already established, and there is no confusion regarding the interpretation of assessment results. Sometimes, however, this is not possible. I get a lot of calls and email asking about how to locate specialists in ODD in different states. Sorry, I’m not aware of any registry like this, although county psychological boards might list specialties. That would be a good place to start.\n\nThe latest education stories from the pages of Scholastic Teacher. Is the following a fair description of the kids who make up your classroom? Three of them struggle with math and four with reading, two are ELLs, one needs speech therapy, and two seem determined to never give you a moment of peace. As a teacher, you face a variety of hurdles, but that doesn’t mean you have to go it alone—your army of paraprofessionals, school counselors, speech therapists, reading specialists, and others are there to support you. Each of these specialists has a unique role and a common goal: to help your students, and you, succeed. Together, they are a fount of educational expertise. We asked a group of support people to share tips on working together with teachers. Here’s what they said. Their job: Provide support to students who have communication disorders that affect academic performance\nHow to leverage this relationship: Speech therapists work with kids who have articulation disorders—difficulty pronouncing words—as well as children who struggle with expressive language. They work on building these skills in one-on-one sessions but can help students in ways that directly apply to class assignments as well. “If a student has poor language skills and has an oral presentation coming up, I can help her—if I know about it,” says Christine Waddell, a speech-language pathologist at Edison Elementary School in Bow, Washington. Teachers who clue in Waddell to upcoming assignments that might present a challenge to certain students give her the opportunity to provide very specific, immediately applicable support. Close cooperation between classroom teachers and speech therapists is essential for students who are receiving support for an articulation disorder, Waddell points out. That’s because articulation disorders are intimately linked to difficulties with phonemic awareness, which also affects students’ reading ability. Because speech therapists have such limited time with students, however, they can’t provide as much phonemic support as students need. “I don’t necessarily treat phonemic awareness as a goal, because I only see a student one or two times a week for half an hour, and [I have to] treat the actual articulation disorder,” Waddell explains. Bonus tip: Classroom teachers can help students by playing a lot of word games in the classroom, says Waddell, even beyond the earliest grades. Their job: Provide extra support and instruction to struggling readers\nHow to leverage this relationship: “Reading is the hardest thing we learn how to do,” says Mary Martin,\na reading clinician who works with children at Rosa Parks Elementary School in Portland, Oregon. Students who struggle with reading may have difficulty with different aspects of the process, but the one thing they have in common is a lack of confidence. Carefully choose materials and activities that help these children avoid embarrassment and experience success, suggests Martin. “If you try to present a student with reading materials that are too complex, the student feels like a failure when he or she has trouble decoding or answering questions.” Regular check-ins with the child’s reading specialist can help you choose materials that are appropriately challenging. A reading specialist can also help you figure out how to adapt other elements of your curriculum to meet students’ needs. For instance, a fifth grader who isn’t reading at grade level will probably struggle with a spelling list based on words from books the class is reading. You can support the student’s learning (and build confidence) by providing spelling words that correspond with phonics rules the child is practicing with the specialist. “Try a list of words where sections of the words follow the same rule,” Martin says. “You don’t want to crush the student’s spirit with a spelling test; you want to help him build words.”\nTheir job: Provide instructional support to students under the direction and guidance of a licensed educator\nHow to leverage this relationship: Students form distinct relationships with people, and a paraprofessional who “clicks” with a student can share all kinds of ideas regarding how to best work with that child. Furthermore, because paraprofessionals bring their own unique backgrounds and skill sets into the classroom, they may see things you don’t and they may consider options you may not be aware of. “We might not have a certification or a degree, but we do have knowledge and history,” says Stephanie Dewberry, a paraprofessional who works with students on the autism spectrum at William M. Boyd Elementary in Atlanta.\n\nYou have a part in this, too — so take notes about a typical day with your child, including behaviors, language, and habits. Or videotape your child so that you have a visual record of where your child is, developmentally. Ask the professionals who work with your child to take some baseline data on her skills as a basis for comparison later. You should look for progress in three months, and again at six months. SP: What if, after following these suggestions, you're not satisfied with the help your child is getting? LeComer: Don't be afraid to approach the professionals working with your child to express your concerns. Asking questions or kindly stating your unhappiness with the level or type of services your child is receiving is absolutely warranted. Make sure, though, that your expectations are reasonable. Talk to other parents and professionals and educate yourself about your child's specific difficulties. This will help you discuss treatment more confidently. It's helpful to ask for a meeting in which all who work with your child can hear and discuss your concerns. Try to make a positive difference by being honest and helpful. But don't feel stuck in a situation that you believe is not going anywhere. You know your child best, and you're within your legal rights to make a change if you truly feel it's warranted. SP: How can parents help their child's self-esteem remain intact when there is a delay? LeComer: Examine your own attitude when in your child's presence. What does your body language and tone of voice convey to your child? Try to be your child's biggest cheerleader, and show him that you notice and appreciate his good deeds, his hard work, or his doing one more drill or task or test when he really didn't want to. Ask your child if you can be of assistance in some way. Don't make his therapy the focus of your family's daily life. It should be a component that will help your child participate more in the family, not the one thing your whole lives revolve around. Involve your child in your own interests and hobbies, and maybe help him find a hobby of his own. SP: How can parents help themselves through this challenge? LeComer: The doubt, frustration, and worry involved in having a child with developmental delays can affect your relationship with your spouse, your parenting skills, your patience, and your time with your other children. Parent groups, both in person and online, are great ways to meet other mothers and fathers, whether just to vent your concerns or to share tips on how to cope with the daily reality of your family's situation.\n\nTreatment For Mental Health Disorders In Children\n- Advice on managing distressing feelings and unwanted behaviour\n- Family appointments to think about ways to resolve problems together\n- Individual therapy for your child to help them understand their feelings and learn new ways of coping\n- Medication prescribed by a child and adolescent psychiatrist\n- Support to other professionals about how best they can help you and your child\nCognitive Behavioural Therapy\nA model that focuses on the relationship between thoughts, feelings and behaviours and explores practical and meaningful ways of working through current difficulties. The young person is understood as part of an organic and evolving system, for example the family. Change in one part of the system affects the system as a whole. Parent Training (Behavioural Therapy)\nThe therapist coaches parents in applying such strategies as rewarding positive behaviour, and responding to negative behaviour with clear consequences and time out . There is increasing evidence that medication can be a helpful addition to other treatments in some conditions e.g. severe depression, OCD, ADHD\nLiaison with Other Agencies\nIt is often important to share information about the child with professionals e.g. teachers, Paediatricians or school nurses, so that everyone is working together. When A Child Is Referred To Us\n- All referrals are discussed by the team before a first appointment is offered. An initial appointment may be with any of the team, depending on the problem being referred. - We would usually see the parents and child together as well as separately, as appropriate. - After this, further sessions with the same clinician may be offered if appropriate, or a more detailed assessment organised with other members of the team. - At the end of an assessment or piece of treatment, we would usually produce a report for the family, which can be shared with others e.g. GPs, with the family’s consent\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat mental health problems can children experience? Whilst serious mental illnesses are rare in children, emotional and behavioural problems are common, for example:\n- Low mood\n- Poor performance at school\nThese may be a response to stresses in a child’s environment, such as bereavement, illness in a family member, or divorce. The child may be suffering trauma, such as bullying. Or they may have a developmental disability such as a learning difficulty, autism or Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). Who are the different people that make up the CAMHS multidisciplinary team? - Child and adolescent psychiatrists – these are medical doctors who specialise in young people’s mental health, including the use of psychological and pharmacological therapy. They have specialist knowledge of child development, the links between physical and mental health, and how biological, psychological and social issues may combine to produce mental health problems. - Clinical psychologists – these have a comprehensive doctoral training in mental health and emotional wellbeing. They have detailed knowledge of patterns of thinking, feeling, relating and behaviour. They can complete assessments that can indicate issues that may affect learning (e.g. memory, attention). Clinical psychologists may specialise in particular therapies e.g. family therapy or Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). - Child and adolescent mental health nurses – these are qualified mental health nurses who specialise in working with young people with mental health problems and their families. They often have additional training in specific therapies e.g. family therapy, CBT, parent training, or psychodynamic approaches to treatment. They usually work in multidisciplinary teams, liaising closely with GPs, schools, and social workers, etc. Does my child need a child psychiatrist? It may not be necessary for your child to see a psychiatrist. All members of our team are highly qualified and experienced, and our nurse and psychologist are able to offer initial assessments. They are also experts in psychological treatments e.g. parenting support, family work, individual therapy. A psychiatrist may need to be involved if:\n- There are concerns about serious mental illness, physical ill-health, or a complex developmental disorder. - Psychological approaches haven’t been sufficient and another treatment, such as medication, needs to be considered. Why does CAMHS share information with other professionals? We have a legal and professional duty to do what is in a child’s best interests, which includes sharing information when necessary. Children will often be experiencing difficulties in multiple settings e.g. school, home, social situations. Treatment may therefore combine clinic-based therapy, parents carrying out behaviour management strategies at home, and support from school. All the adults working together (e.g.\n\nYou can find many tips for effective advocacy, including tips for preparing for and discussing your concerns in meetings with school, in the section Raising a concern with school. In the meeting, or beforehand, you can draw the school’s attention to the relevant parts of the Disability Standards for Education as noted above (a direct link is provided in our Tools and Resources section). You can suggest that the school request advice on the right adjustments to meet your child’s learning needs from a relevant specialist in the regional DET office; for more information about these staff, see the relevant page in A guide to the support system. There are many ways in which these staff can help. Alternatively, if your child is already in contact with a therapist or other specialist who can attend an SSG meeting in a consultant role and provide similar input, suggest this to the school. This is provided for in the SSG Guidelines, which you can download from the DET website. For tips on how to effectively raise the suggestion with school, see the relevant page in Building a partnership with school. Challenges with communicating your child’s learning needs\nThe Commonwealth Disability Standard for Education require that your child’s school consult with you about your child’s disability, and its impacts on your child’s learning needs. This means that within the support system for students with disabilities, you have an important role to play in helping the school to understand your child’s disability and learning needs. So you can be confident about communicating this to the school, and sharing your knowledge of what will help your child to feel comfortable at school, and to reach their learning potential. The primary forum for consultation with you about your child’s disability and needs is through regular SSG meetings (compulsory if your child is on the Program for Students with Disabilities, and highly recommended by DET if not), and seeking your input to create an individual learning and support plan for your child. This is a plan that sets out their learning goals and adjustments to school programs to help them meet those goals. As explained in the section above, schools are legally required to make such adjustments, to give your child the opportunity to learn ‘on the same basis’ as students without a disability. SSG meetings and an individual learning and support plan are a central part of how schools are required to meet the needs of students with disabilities, and not an ‘add on’ or something that only occurs if your child is having problems. If your child’s school does not have these things in place for your child, you can ask for them. If needed, you can draw the school’s attention to relevant parts of the Disability Standards for Education, and the relevant DET policies such as the Guidelines for the Program for Students with Disabilities (if you child is on the PSD) and the Guidelines for Student Support Groups (relevant whether or not your child is on the PSD). - Find links in our Tools and resources\nDET supplies a range of resources to schools, to help them assess a student’s learning strengths and needs, and gain insight into what kind of adjustments might be most effective in supporting their learning. This includes assessment tools, curriculum content and guidelines, professional development and expert advice from specialist in the DET regional office. You can refer the school to the relevant sections of Learning Together, or suggest that they request advice from a specialist DET staff member. Alternatively, if your child is already in contact with a therapist or other specialist who can attend an SSG meeting in a consultant role, suggest this to the school. - For tips on how to make the suggestion, see the relevant page in Building a partnership with school. - For information on all of the resources listed above, see the relevant pages in A guide to the support system and Education planning for your child. Challenging responses to input and ideas about your child’s learning needs. You have a key role to play in helping the school understand what adjustment your child might require; under the Disability Standards for Education, schools are legally required to consult with the parents and carers of all students with disabilities or additional needs about their child’s disability, and its impact on their learning needs. The most important forum for this is SSG meetings. You can draw the school’s attention to the relevant section of the Disability Standards for Education that outlines their legal obligation to consult with parents and carers, and suggest that they look at Learning Together for ideas about consulting with parents and carers. The support system for students with disabilities is designed to encourage input from DET and external specialists in meeting the needs of students with disabilities, and DET provides specialist staff who can do this in their regional offices.\n\nWhilst we work in a number of different ways with children, adolescents and adults we promise to always be respectful, creative and find a way that works for you. Children and adolescents\nWe know that growing up can be hard sometimes. It can be helpful to talk to someone outside of your family if something is getting in the way of you enjoying life to the full. You might have been experiencing difficulties such as:\n- Low self-esteem\n- Low mood or feeling unhappy\n- Getting worried, panicky or anxious\n- Having problems in your family\n- Living with a health condition\n- Having to do something in a certain way or a certain number of times to make it feel okay\nIt would be helpful for one of us to initially meet with you to understand the difficulties you are facing. We would explore how it affects you at home, at school, with your friends and think about how they can best help you. It would also be helpful to meet one of your parents or guardians, and you could bring a friend if that would help you feel more comfortable. Together we would decide if it is best to work with you individually or if working with you and your parent\/guardian would be better. It is possible for one of our Psychologists to meet individually with a young person as well as meeting individually with a parent; this can often be a helpful way to work. We understand that life can be challenging in a variety of different ways. Sometimes people need space to be heard and supported to understand and work through the difficulties they face. We hope that through this work, using a variety of models tailored to fit your needs, we can support you to maximise your strengths and resilience. We can work therapeutically with a range of difficulties including:\n- Low mood\n- Low self-esteem\n- Work stress\n- Health problems\n- Relationship issues\n- Overcoming traumatic events\n- Grief and loss\nWe would meet with you to get an understanding of the difficulties and to assess your current situation. Based on this information we would think together about what therapeutic approach may be best suited to you. We would also be happy to meet with members of your family or a partner if that would be helpful. We understand that having a child can change your life and throw up challenges along the way that make it hard to feel like a “good enough parent”. We recognise that you are an expert about your child and your family situation. We invite you to bring that knowledge, together with our expertise in evidence-based strategies that have been shown to help parents and their children. In doing so we hope to create a winning team that helps you to move towards your goals. We acknowledge that there is not one “right” answer but we can work together to find strategies that fit you, your child and your family situation. We can work with a variety of difficulties including:\n- Challenging behaviour and tantrums\n- Sleeping and\/or eating difficulties\n- Relationship and communication difficulties\n- Understanding and supporting children with learning or physical disabilities\nWe are experienced at working alongside and supervising other professionals. We understand that working in the helping professions can be stressful in itself and would be happy to meet with mental health professionals from a therapeutic perspective. We are able to offer:\n- Supervision to mental health professionals or other clinical psychologists\n- Therapies for trainee mental health workers\n- Teaching, training and workshops\n- Team building, managing changing circumstances, and building resilience for individuals, teams or groups.\n\nAs a parent with a child newly diagnosed with autism, it can be easy to ask yourself, “What do I do for my child diagnosed with autism?” This is a reaction that is to be expected and can be followed with overwhelming feelings and a lot of questions. The good news is that parents don’t have to let an autism diagnosis intimidate or overwhelm them because they are not alone on this journey. Families can find a lot of support, resources, and services through talking to their child’s doctor and team of therapists, teachers at the child’s school, as well as other parents in the autism community. Having and maintaining communication between the child’s team, as well as support groups will prove to be helpful. Your child’s team could consist of the child’s doctor or developmental pediatrician, occupational therapist, speech language pathologist, as well as other mental and physical health professionals, and special education or other services through your child’s school. This team is helpful and does best when working together with the parents and child when setting goals and putting services into place. Steps after receiving your child’s diagnosis of autism\nFamilies play a large role for autistic children. They have been the ones that have witnessed the differing and sometimes difficult to understand behaviors, noticed differences in the child’s development, they know the child’s strengths, and have been there when they learn new skills and language or communication development. The child’s parents will meet with the team and they will discuss the child’s development, strengths, and goals to work towards. The parents will also receive information on community support and services that are available for the newly diagnosed autistic child. The meetings are as frequent as is decided by the parents and team. This is a great time for any questions or concerns to be brought out and discussed. Depending on when your child was diagnosed, there are early intervention services available to support the early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders. These help jump start your child’s therapies and other services that they may qualify for. When plans and goals are figured, they are then put together to form a very individualized plan for your child. Each part and therapy is discussed at the initial meeting and discussed at each decided upon meeting afterward. There may be a need for an individual evaluation following the full assessment that your child already had to receive a diagnosis of autism. These individual evaluations would depend on the practitioner, for instance there may be an assessment for speech therapy, behavioral therapy, or occupational therapy to get a baseline for the therapist to develop a specialized path for your child’s development and growth in that area, based on the goals discussed. What can I do to help my child? There is a lot that parents can do when it comes to helping their autistic child through their therapies and services. Parents learn a lot either through the observation of therapy, or through more hands-on activities like pretend play, using sign language to build communication skills, as well as being there during real life social situations being their child’s support. Attending autism parents support groups, reading quality books about autism spectrum disorder written by parents, autistic individuals, and professionals, and using the skills you have gained through observation and parent education that can be available through services like Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) or other therapies can help build your confidence, while helping your child. The members on your child’s team should be able to answer questions and offer specific suggestions that would benefit your child and family. Through my experience, therapists strongly suggest that parents continue what the child is learning during a session at home and will generally give the parent and\/or family the tools and support to help the process. That is one of the reasons that parents, caregivers, individuals, and the team come together to create the goals that will shape the therapies and services for the growth and success of the individual. Click here to sign up now! Where do parents find support? There are many different ways that parents can find support so that they have the skills, or can start building the skills to best help their child’s development. It can be very individualized, depending on the specifics of your child’s diagnosis, or it can be broad and cover a spectrum, depending on what the parent is looking for. There are many different kinds of support groups for parents, siblings, and families of individuals diagnosed with autism.\n\nAssessment is dependent upon our observations of the children. Anne O’Brien, an experienced teacher and headteacher of young children, explores how we can use the observations we have made to inform the next stage of our planning. - Observing the children as they play and learn\n- Talking with children and finding out what they know, can do and how they feel\n- Analysing and interpreting what you see and hear. Assessment does not stand alone. It transcends all teaching and learning opportunities. It is an important starting point. When you know what the children can do and know, you can decide what they need next. Assessment can enable you to improve your own professional skills. As you assess the children you will discover what is successful and what doesn’t work. You will be able to identify tasks, which allowed real growth and development of skills, and through analysis you will be able to identify the factors, which contributed to this success – and use them again to inform future planning. You will become a more skilled professional. Three key questions to keep in mind are:\n- Why do we need it? - What can it tell us? - How can we use it? - supports children’s learning\n- affects future planning\n- contributes to professional development\n- amend your short term planning\n- inform your medium term and long term plans\n- adapt activities to suit the needs of individual children\n- modify tasks to match children’s known abilities\n- provide children with positive and specific feedback as they work and play. The rest of this article provides a route into how effective observation within your setting can raise the level of professionalism amongst your staff. Staff need to be trained in how to observe, how to interpret\ntheir observations and how to use the information they have acquired to inform their future planning and activities. We all know about the importance of observing children as they play, learn and interact with others. We see how they learn as we watch them. We notice the way they approach a problem. We can identify those who methodically try different ways or repeat their actions after a failed attempt. We identify those who give up on the first attempt if it’s not successful or those who are unwilling to try something new. We see what they learn. We can spot steps towards the learning of skills and knowledge. We can see aspects that are proving too tricky at this moment. So what! If your observations stop there, it has all been a waste of your time. ‘Observations are not an end in themselves but a tool for gathering information about a child.’ (Kay 2005, p90)\nWhat happens to your observations? Are they planned, or are your staff simply looking around and chancing upon a child achieving or struggling? If observations are recorded, how is that information then used? Here are some questions, which will help you to focus on what is happening in your setting. They could be a starting point for discussion with your team as you develop your assessment practice. Are observations recorded as soon as possible? - Carry a notebook in your pocket and jot down your observations ready to be recorded later onto your formal documents\n- Keep a card index file – one child per card – in your room and jot down notes\n- Carry Post-it notes to jot down observations to be transferred to formal documents later\nHow often do you observe each child? - Put the names of the children for whom you are the key worker in your notebook, one per page, at the start of each day. Choose two or three of your children per day and observe them all on a rota system. - Allocate one member of the team per session to carry out observations of all of the children at a particular activity, and share the information later. - Put an agreed number of cards in the front of a file index box at the start of each day, and observe those for whom you are the key worker, returning their cards to the back of the box at the end of the day. - Make a weekly check to ensure all children are being observed regularly. Do you observe children at a variety of activities over time? - Focus on one activity per session, having set up a specific activity for this. - Change the focus activity each session so that you cover child-led, adult-led, free and organised, indoor and outdoor, individual and group activities over the week. Are all staff members involved in observations, discussion and planning? - Observations, planning and learning will be more effective if all members of your team are involved. Do you discuss your observations with your colleagues? - Think about your plans: at the end of the week look through your observations together and evaluate the planned activities in relation to your observations. Did the activities allow the children to gain the skills or the knowledge that you intended?\n\nFinding Psychological Help for Your Child\nLocating a Therapist\nThe way you find a therapist, psychologist or other mental health professional can be crucial to your child’s success, said Dale Masi, a professor at the University of Maryland graduate school for social work. In her recent book “Shrink to Fit” (Health Communications, $10.95), she suggests seeking referrals from mental health workers you know, your primary physician and people in support groups dealing with the same issues. “You know, most people find a therapist in the telephone book,” she said. “I would not necessarily recommend that.”\nGarnette strongly suggests that parents check with their insurance company or HMO for guidelines about what is covered and for how long. When in doubt about a practitioner, she would turn to a trusted friend. “Your best bet is a friend who operates very much like you do,” Garnette said. Once you have a few names, Masi suggests meeting with the doctors without your child. Go armed with a list of questions and get answers about their education, experience, expertise with children, and the specific issues or diagnoses affecting your child. “You should not feel uncomfortable interviewing a therapist,” Masi said. And think about the office atmosphere. Masi would have doubts about a doctor who claimed to specialize in children, but who had no toys or child-sized furniture in the waiting room. “Definitely look for an expertise in treating children,” Garnette said. “Children are not all little adults. A lot of it has to do with how you just click with a person because it’s so personal.”\nGarnette would also seek someone with a few years’ experience because “you do get better with practice.”\nLeman also recommends finding a therapist who wants to help the child, not finish the payments on his yacht. “Find someone who wants to get rid of you,” he said. “If they’re good, they want the child to be well and take off on his own.”\nHe would also check with the local mental health society or board for any misconduct cases against a professional you’re considering. Don’t expect to rely on one psychiatrist, psychologist or therapist alone. Many cases are best helped by a network of parents and professionals working together on different aspects of the child’s therapy. As a result, Masi suggests asking about affiliations when interviewing the initial professional. “If she’s not a psychiatrist, ask what psychiatrist she works with and if that person is a child psychiatrist,” Masi said. For many cases, experts recommend a comprehensive plan, taking in a few professionals. For example, a plan for a child showing severe attention problems in school might include talk therapy with a family therapist, participation in a social-skills group and drug management through a psychiatrist. “Ideally, you want a situation in which all those people talk to each other and that ‘s really difficult,” Garnette said. The situation is made more difficult by current practices in health management organizations and insurers that often have definite guidelines regarding length of treatment and the types of professional care covered. On average, Garnette says, managed-care companies will pay for 10 to 15 sessions, but it’s often fewer. In advocating for her son, she once threatened a vice president of her HMO with a lawsuit before the company agreed to extra care. “They want to cure everyone in four sessions and it’s just not possible,” Garnette said. And ask up front how long the therapist expects his or her work with your child to continue. Even a rough estimate can help you plan for expenses and the effect on the child and the family, Masi says. Traumatic situations don’t always allow for weeks of planning. However, some don’t require a therapist either, Leman says. In the case of a child grieving after a family member’s death, Leman encourages parents to “give themselves more credit.”\n“Why would a kid want to see a stranger if they’re grieving?” he asked. “Share your imperfect self with your child. It’s healthy for them to see you cry, pray, be concerned. That’s OK.”\nGarnette cautions parents to remain involved in the therapy process so they will see if changes are needed. Her son went through five psychiatrists before he found one that seemed a perfect match. “It’s worth it when you get there,” Garnette said. “Your gut feeling is often right.”\nGuinness, M. (2016).","passages":[{"passage":"Treatment Help, Part 3\nSomeone who has just spent some time with your child should be able to give you a few reactions or observations. It is completely reasonable to let evaluators know that you’d like a few minutes at the end of the session to get a sense of what they think. Always take notes. You may be more tense than you realize, and it may be hard to remember exactly what you did or didn’t hear. Ask to have unfamiliar terms spelled out and explained and request sources of information you can consult. If you’ve had a full multi-specialty evaluation done, consider making an appointment to come back in, sit down, and discuss the results. Keep a notebook. As time goes by, you will think of questions you want to ask, observations about your child that seem significant, ideas for further assessment or therapy. Write them all down in a notebook. There you can also make note of the specialists you see, the tests they do, the information they give. Jot down phone numbers of programs or specialists you learn about from other parents, as well as contact data for someone who isn’t that helpful now but may be in a few years. A notebook will help you track your child and your own understanding. It will also help you use your time with the specialists to ask the questions you’ve been wanting to bring up. Trust your instincts. Go into this process with an open mind but also with a healthy degree of skepticism. If someone tells you something that absolutely does not fit with your sense of your child, consider it objectively. If it’s nonsense, forget it. Don’t let someone who can’t answer questions to your satisfaction pursue a long-term therapeutic relationship with your child, no matter how grand or glorious his degrees or reception room. Don’t expect a “eureka” moment. We’ll say it again because it’s so important: By and large, quirky kids don’t fit neatly into diagnostic categories. The ongoing process of having your child assessed and considering different diagnoses can be valuable if it points the way to helping your child. Still, it’s probably not going to yield a single, illuminating conclusion when you find out what’s “really” going on. Some specialists or clinics will give almost anyone a diagnosis. If you look hard and long enough, you will come across someone who will pin a label on your child—perhaps because it’s the same label everybody gets at that particular clinic. Be especially wary of labels that carry immediate recommendations for expensive therapists. Don’t let anyone prey on your desire to help your child. It’s worth getting a second opinion or discussing the recommendation with your own pediatrician. Most of the professionals you will encounter as you look into assessment and diagnosis will be honorable. It must be said, however, that there is something of an industry out there in providing diagnoses and therapies to kids with developmental variations. This brings us, once again, to our preference for the academic medical center. Finally, don’t forget that the point of all this—the workup, the testing, the consideration of your child by multiple experts—is not to come up with the right label, the right name, the right answer on some cosmic medical-student exam.

The structure and level of aggrevation the child slips into this part of the assessment can be quite revealing and helpful in planning intervention. Two common examples of projectives are sentence completion tasks and standardized ink blot instruments. Diagnostic interview: A comprehensive interview with the child provides a wealth of strategic information. I happen to use a 155 question interview that I developed for this purpose (although it’s not always necessary to ask them all). The interview captures the youngster’s take on peer relationships, school functioning, factors of home and community and, of course, self. It samples their concerns in their terms, providing insight to areas where they would be most receptive to intervention. All this information is then complied into a comprehensive report that outlines the findings, provides a diagnosis (if there is one), and offers recommendations for intervention. The cost of an assessment like this ranges from a few hundred dollars to well over $1,000. Health insurance generally covers some, if not all, of the expense. Who can do these evaluations? Psychologists can, as well as anyone else trained and licensed or certified to do all components of the assessment. If your child’s oppositional and defiant behavior is causing them to have serious trouble progressing through school, you might ask the school to do an assessment. They have folks on staff who do this sort of thing all the time. They usually have at least one doctorate level psychologist on staff or as a consultant to help with the tougher challenges. Large counties often have a county psychological board (check the phone book) that can refer specialists who work with children. Also, a department of psychology or counseling of a nearby university (universities offer graduate training) might provide assistance or direction. In some cases, they may provide actual counseling or therapy services through their lab programs. Although the services are being provided by students, they are supervised, and they are usually motivated to do a good job. You don’t have much to lose, and the cost is minmal (like free, if they need kids). Keep in mind also that school counselors are required to maintain a resource list as part of their Crisis Response Plan. Ask them; they can probably help directly, or initiate a referral. Then, of course, there’s always the phone book. I believe it is best to find someone who specializes in children and adolescents. Who should do the counseling or therapy? For obvious reasons, it helps a lot if it is the same person who did the assessment. Rapport is already established, and there is no confusion regarding the interpretation of assessment results. Sometimes, however, this is not possible. I get a lot of calls and email asking about how to locate specialists in ODD in different states. Sorry, I’m not aware of any registry like this, although county psychological boards might list specialties. That would be a good place to start.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:bf776d14-d370-416f-8a38-a212eb6bbf28>"]},{"passage":"The latest education stories from the pages of Scholastic Teacher. Is the following a fair description of the kids who make up your classroom? Three of them struggle with math and four with reading, two are ELLs, one needs speech therapy, and two seem determined to never give you a moment of peace. As a teacher, you face a variety of hurdles, but that doesn’t mean you have to go it alone—your army of paraprofessionals, school counselors, speech therapists, reading specialists, and others are there to support you. Each of these specialists has a unique role and a common goal: to help your students, and you, succeed. Together, they are a fount of educational expertise. We asked a group of support people to share tips on working together with teachers. Here’s what they said. Their job: Provide support to students who have communication disorders that affect academic performance\nHow to leverage this relationship: Speech therapists work with kids who have articulation disorders—difficulty pronouncing words—as well as children who struggle with expressive language. They work on building these skills in one-on-one sessions but can help students in ways that directly apply to class assignments as well. “If a student has poor language skills and has an oral presentation coming up, I can help her—if I know about it,” says Christine Waddell, a speech-language pathologist at Edison Elementary School in Bow, Washington. Teachers who clue in Waddell to upcoming assignments that might present a challenge to certain students give her the opportunity to provide very specific, immediately applicable support. Close cooperation between classroom teachers and speech therapists is essential for students who are receiving support for an articulation disorder, Waddell points out. That’s because articulation disorders are intimately linked to difficulties with phonemic awareness, which also affects students’ reading ability. Because speech therapists have such limited time with students, however, they can’t provide as much phonemic support as students need. “I don’t necessarily treat phonemic awareness as a goal, because I only see a student one or two times a week for half an hour, and [I have to] treat the actual articulation disorder,” Waddell explains. Bonus tip: Classroom teachers can help students by playing a lot of word games in the classroom, says Waddell, even beyond the earliest grades. Their job: Provide extra support and instruction to struggling readers\nHow to leverage this relationship: “Reading is the hardest thing we learn how to do,” says Mary Martin,\na reading clinician who works with children at Rosa Parks Elementary School in Portland, Oregon. Students who struggle with reading may have difficulty with different aspects of the process, but the one thing they have in common is a lack of confidence. Carefully choose materials and activities that help these children avoid embarrassment and experience success, suggests Martin. “If you try to present a student with reading materials that are too complex, the student feels like a failure when he or she has trouble decoding or answering questions.” Regular check-ins with the child’s reading specialist can help you choose materials that are appropriately challenging. A reading specialist can also help you figure out how to adapt other elements of your curriculum to meet students’ needs. For instance, a fifth grader who isn’t reading at grade level will probably struggle with a spelling list based on words from books the class is reading. You can support the student’s learning (and build confidence) by providing spelling words that correspond with phonics rules the child is practicing with the specialist. “Try a list of words where sections of the words follow the same rule,” Martin says. “You don’t want to crush the student’s spirit with a spelling test; you want to help him build words.”\nTheir job: Provide instructional support to students under the direction and guidance of a licensed educator\nHow to leverage this relationship: Students form distinct relationships with people, and a paraprofessional who “clicks” with a student can share all kinds of ideas regarding how to best work with that child. Furthermore, because paraprofessionals bring their own unique backgrounds and skill sets into the classroom, they may see things you don’t and they may consider options you may not be aware of. “We might not have a certification or a degree, but we do have knowledge and history,” says Stephanie Dewberry, a paraprofessional who works with students on the autism spectrum at William M. Boyd Elementary in Atlanta.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:65ca45b2-2eaa-4fdc-9ef7-a30715c47327>"]},{"passage":"You have a part in this, too — so take notes about a typical day with your child, including behaviors, language, and habits. Or videotape your child so that you have a visual record of where your child is, developmentally. Ask the professionals who work with your child to take some baseline data on her skills as a basis for comparison later. You should look for progress in three months, and again at six months. SP: What if, after following these suggestions, you're not satisfied with the help your child is getting? LeComer: Don't be afraid to approach the professionals working with your child to express your concerns. Asking questions or kindly stating your unhappiness with the level or type of services your child is receiving is absolutely warranted. Make sure, though, that your expectations are reasonable. Talk to other parents and professionals and educate yourself about your child's specific difficulties. This will help you discuss treatment more confidently. It's helpful to ask for a meeting in which all who work with your child can hear and discuss your concerns. Try to make a positive difference by being honest and helpful. But don't feel stuck in a situation that you believe is not going anywhere. You know your child best, and you're within your legal rights to make a change if you truly feel it's warranted. SP: How can parents help their child's self-esteem remain intact when there is a delay? LeComer: Examine your own attitude when in your child's presence. What does your body language and tone of voice convey to your child? Try to be your child's biggest cheerleader, and show him that you notice and appreciate his good deeds, his hard work, or his doing one more drill or task or test when he really didn't want to. Ask your child if you can be of assistance in some way. Don't make his therapy the focus of your family's daily life. It should be a component that will help your child participate more in the family, not the one thing your whole lives revolve around. Involve your child in your own interests and hobbies, and maybe help him find a hobby of his own. SP: How can parents help themselves through this challenge? LeComer: The doubt, frustration, and worry involved in having a child with developmental delays can affect your relationship with your spouse, your parenting skills, your patience, and your time with your other children. Parent groups, both in person and online, are great ways to meet other mothers and fathers, whether just to vent your concerns or to share tips on how to cope with the daily reality of your family's situation.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:b4ed7f3f-1950-44b3-9edf-fdb5edfe06dc>"]},{"passage":"Treatment For Mental Health Disorders In Children\n- Advice on managing distressing feelings and unwanted behaviour\n- Family appointments to think about ways to resolve problems together\n- Individual therapy for your child to help them understand their feelings and learn new ways of coping\n- Medication prescribed by a child and adolescent psychiatrist\n- Support to other professionals about how best they can help you and your child\nCognitive Behavioural Therapy\nA model that focuses on the relationship between thoughts, feelings and behaviours and explores practical and meaningful ways of working through current difficulties. The young person is understood as part of an organic and evolving system, for example the family. Change in one part of the system affects the system as a whole. Parent Training (Behavioural Therapy)\nThe therapist coaches parents in applying such strategies as rewarding positive behaviour, and responding to negative behaviour with clear consequences and time out . There is increasing evidence that medication can be a helpful addition to other treatments in some conditions e.g. severe depression, OCD, ADHD\nLiaison with Other Agencies\nIt is often important to share information about the child with professionals e.g. teachers, Paediatricians or school nurses, so that everyone is working together. When A Child Is Referred To Us\n- All referrals are discussed by the team before a first appointment is offered. An initial appointment may be with any of the team, depending on the problem being referred. - We would usually see the parents and child together as well as separately, as appropriate. - After this, further sessions with the same clinician may be offered if appropriate, or a more detailed assessment organised with other members of the team. - At the end of an assessment or piece of treatment, we would usually produce a report for the family, which can be shared with others e.g. GPs, with the family’s consent\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat mental health problems can children experience? Whilst serious mental illnesses are rare in children, emotional and behavioural problems are common, for example:\n- Low mood\n- Poor performance at school\nThese may be a response to stresses in a child’s environment, such as bereavement, illness in a family member, or divorce. The child may be suffering trauma, such as bullying. Or they may have a developmental disability such as a learning difficulty, autism or Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). Who are the different people that make up the CAMHS multidisciplinary team? - Child and adolescent psychiatrists – these are medical doctors who specialise in young people’s mental health, including the use of psychological and pharmacological therapy. They have specialist knowledge of child development, the links between physical and mental health, and how biological, psychological and social issues may combine to produce mental health problems. - Clinical psychologists – these have a comprehensive doctoral training in mental health and emotional wellbeing. They have detailed knowledge of patterns of thinking, feeling, relating and behaviour. They can complete assessments that can indicate issues that may affect learning (e.g. memory, attention). Clinical psychologists may specialise in particular therapies e.g. family therapy or Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). - Child and adolescent mental health nurses – these are qualified mental health nurses who specialise in working with young people with mental health problems and their families. They often have additional training in specific therapies e.g. family therapy, CBT, parent training, or psychodynamic approaches to treatment. They usually work in multidisciplinary teams, liaising closely with GPs, schools, and social workers, etc. Does my child need a child psychiatrist? It may not be necessary for your child to see a psychiatrist. All members of our team are highly qualified and experienced, and our nurse and psychologist are able to offer initial assessments. They are also experts in psychological treatments e.g. parenting support, family work, individual therapy. A psychiatrist may need to be involved if:\n- There are concerns about serious mental illness, physical ill-health, or a complex developmental disorder. - Psychological approaches haven’t been sufficient and another treatment, such as medication, needs to be considered. Why does CAMHS share information with other professionals? We have a legal and professional duty to do what is in a child’s best interests, which includes sharing information when necessary. Children will often be experiencing difficulties in multiple settings e.g. school, home, social situations. Treatment may therefore combine clinic-based therapy, parents carrying out behaviour management strategies at home, and support from school.

In the meeting, or beforehand, you can draw the school’s attention to the relevant parts of the Disability Standards for Education as noted above (a direct link is provided in our Tools and Resources section). You can suggest that the school request advice on the right adjustments to meet your child’s learning needs from a relevant specialist in the regional DET office; for more information about these staff, see the relevant page in A guide to the support system. There are many ways in which these staff can help. Alternatively, if your child is already in contact with a therapist or other specialist who can attend an SSG meeting in a consultant role and provide similar input, suggest this to the school. This is provided for in the SSG Guidelines, which you can download from the DET website. For tips on how to effectively raise the suggestion with school, see the relevant page in Building a partnership with school. Challenges with communicating your child’s learning needs\nThe Commonwealth Disability Standard for Education require that your child’s school consult with you about your child’s disability, and its impacts on your child’s learning needs. This means that within the support system for students with disabilities, you have an important role to play in helping the school to understand your child’s disability and learning needs. So you can be confident about communicating this to the school, and sharing your knowledge of what will help your child to feel comfortable at school, and to reach their learning potential. The primary forum for consultation with you about your child’s disability and needs is through regular SSG meetings (compulsory if your child is on the Program for Students with Disabilities, and highly recommended by DET if not), and seeking your input to create an individual learning and support plan for your child. This is a plan that sets out their learning goals and adjustments to school programs to help them meet those goals. As explained in the section above, schools are legally required to make such adjustments, to give your child the opportunity to learn ‘on the same basis’ as students without a disability. SSG meetings and an individual learning and support plan are a central part of how schools are required to meet the needs of students with disabilities, and not an ‘add on’ or something that only occurs if your child is having problems. If your child’s school does not have these things in place for your child, you can ask for them. If needed, you can draw the school’s attention to relevant parts of the Disability Standards for Education, and the relevant DET policies such as the Guidelines for the Program for Students with Disabilities (if you child is on the PSD) and the Guidelines for Student Support Groups (relevant whether or not your child is on the PSD). - Find links in our Tools and resources\nDET supplies a range of resources to schools, to help them assess a student’s learning strengths and needs, and gain insight into what kind of adjustments might be most effective in supporting their learning. This includes assessment tools, curriculum content and guidelines, professional development and expert advice from specialist in the DET regional office. You can refer the school to the relevant sections of Learning Together, or suggest that they request advice from a specialist DET staff member. Alternatively, if your child is already in contact with a therapist or other specialist who can attend an SSG meeting in a consultant role, suggest this to the school. - For tips on how to make the suggestion, see the relevant page in Building a partnership with school. - For information on all of the resources listed above, see the relevant pages in A guide to the support system and Education planning for your child. Challenging responses to input and ideas about your child’s learning needs. You have a key role to play in helping the school understand what adjustment your child might require; under the Disability Standards for Education, schools are legally required to consult with the parents and carers of all students with disabilities or additional needs about their child’s disability, and its impact on their learning needs. The most important forum for this is SSG meetings. You can draw the school’s attention to the relevant section of the Disability Standards for Education that outlines their legal obligation to consult with parents and carers, and suggest that they look at Learning Together for ideas about consulting with parents and carers. The support system for students with disabilities is designed to encourage input from DET and external specialists in meeting the needs of students with disabilities, and DET provides specialist staff who can do this in their regional offices.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:48534716-14b9-452c-b6c3-4e6516760504>"]},{"passage":"Whilst we work in a number of different ways with children, adolescents and adults we promise to always be respectful, creative and find a way that works for you. Children and adolescents\nWe know that growing up can be hard sometimes. It can be helpful to talk to someone outside of your family if something is getting in the way of you enjoying life to the full. You might have been experiencing difficulties such as:\n- Low self-esteem\n- Low mood or feeling unhappy\n- Getting worried, panicky or anxious\n- Having problems in your family\n- Living with a health condition\n- Having to do something in a certain way or a certain number of times to make it feel okay\nIt would be helpful for one of us to initially meet with you to understand the difficulties you are facing. We would explore how it affects you at home, at school, with your friends and think about how they can best help you. It would also be helpful to meet one of your parents or guardians, and you could bring a friend if that would help you feel more comfortable. Together we would decide if it is best to work with you individually or if working with you and your parent\/guardian would be better. It is possible for one of our Psychologists to meet individually with a young person as well as meeting individually with a parent; this can often be a helpful way to work. We understand that life can be challenging in a variety of different ways. Sometimes people need space to be heard and supported to understand and work through the difficulties they face. We hope that through this work, using a variety of models tailored to fit your needs, we can support you to maximise your strengths and resilience. We can work therapeutically with a range of difficulties including:\n- Low mood\n- Low self-esteem\n- Work stress\n- Health problems\n- Relationship issues\n- Overcoming traumatic events\n- Grief and loss\nWe would meet with you to get an understanding of the difficulties and to assess your current situation. Based on this information we would think together about what therapeutic approach may be best suited to you. We would also be happy to meet with members of your family or a partner if that would be helpful. We understand that having a child can change your life and throw up challenges along the way that make it hard to feel like a “good enough parent”. We recognise that you are an expert about your child and your family situation. We invite you to bring that knowledge, together with our expertise in evidence-based strategies that have been shown to help parents and their children. In doing so we hope to create a winning team that helps you to move towards your goals. We acknowledge that there is not one “right” answer but we can work together to find strategies that fit you, your child and your family situation. We can work with a variety of difficulties including:\n- Challenging behaviour and tantrums\n- Sleeping and\/or eating difficulties\n- Relationship and communication difficulties\n- Understanding and supporting children with learning or physical disabilities\nWe are experienced at working alongside and supervising other professionals. We understand that working in the helping professions can be stressful in itself and would be happy to meet with mental health professionals from a therapeutic perspective. We are able to offer:\n- Supervision to mental health professionals or other clinical psychologists\n- Therapies for trainee mental health workers\n- Teaching, training and workshops\n- Team building, managing changing circumstances, and building resilience for individuals, teams or groups.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:4c755b53-ac65-46e8-935a-96d5435a96a4>"]},{"passage":"As a parent with a child newly diagnosed with autism, it can be easy to ask yourself, “What do I do for my child diagnosed with autism?” This is a reaction that is to be expected and can be followed with overwhelming feelings and a lot of questions. The good news is that parents don’t have to let an autism diagnosis intimidate or overwhelm them because they are not alone on this journey. Families can find a lot of support, resources, and services through talking to their child’s doctor and team of therapists, teachers at the child’s school, as well as other parents in the autism community. Having and maintaining communication between the child’s team, as well as support groups will prove to be helpful. Your child’s team could consist of the child’s doctor or developmental pediatrician, occupational therapist, speech language pathologist, as well as other mental and physical health professionals, and special education or other services through your child’s school. This team is helpful and does best when working together with the parents and child when setting goals and putting services into place. Steps after receiving your child’s diagnosis of autism\nFamilies play a large role for autistic children. They have been the ones that have witnessed the differing and sometimes difficult to understand behaviors, noticed differences in the child’s development, they know the child’s strengths, and have been there when they learn new skills and language or communication development. The child’s parents will meet with the team and they will discuss the child’s development, strengths, and goals to work towards. The parents will also receive information on community support and services that are available for the newly diagnosed autistic child. The meetings are as frequent as is decided by the parents and team. This is a great time for any questions or concerns to be brought out and discussed. Depending on when your child was diagnosed, there are early intervention services available to support the early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders. These help jump start your child’s therapies and other services that they may qualify for. When plans and goals are figured, they are then put together to form a very individualized plan for your child. Each part and therapy is discussed at the initial meeting and discussed at each decided upon meeting afterward. There may be a need for an individual evaluation following the full assessment that your child already had to receive a diagnosis of autism. These individual evaluations would depend on the practitioner, for instance there may be an assessment for speech therapy, behavioral therapy, or occupational therapy to get a baseline for the therapist to develop a specialized path for your child’s development and growth in that area, based on the goals discussed. What can I do to help my child? There is a lot that parents can do when it comes to helping their autistic child through their therapies and services. Parents learn a lot either through the observation of therapy, or through more hands-on activities like pretend play, using sign language to build communication skills, as well as being there during real life social situations being their child’s support. Attending autism parents support groups, reading quality books about autism spectrum disorder written by parents, autistic individuals, and professionals, and using the skills you have gained through observation and parent education that can be available through services like Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) or other therapies can help build your confidence, while helping your child. The members on your child’s team should be able to answer questions and offer specific suggestions that would benefit your child and family. Through my experience, therapists strongly suggest that parents continue what the child is learning during a session at home and will generally give the parent and\/or family the tools and support to help the process. That is one of the reasons that parents, caregivers, individuals, and the team come together to create the goals that will shape the therapies and services for the growth and success of the individual.

There are many different ways that parents can find support so that they have the skills, or can start building the skills to best help their child’s development. It can be very individualized, depending on the specifics of your child’s diagnosis, or it can be broad and cover a spectrum, depending on what the parent is looking for. There are many different kinds of support groups for parents, siblings, and families of individuals diagnosed with autism.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:64d38e87-2b11-4e67-8087-c18cb4f5e4c7>"]},{"passage":"Assessment is dependent upon our observations of the children. Anne O’Brien, an experienced teacher and headteacher of young children, explores how we can use the observations we have made to inform the next stage of our planning. - Observing the children as they play and learn\n- Talking with children and finding out what they know, can do and how they feel\n- Analysing and interpreting what you see and hear. Assessment does not stand alone. It transcends all teaching and learning opportunities. It is an important starting point. When you know what the children can do and know, you can decide what they need next. Assessment can enable you to improve your own professional skills. As you assess the children you will discover what is successful and what doesn’t work. You will be able to identify tasks, which allowed real growth and development of skills, and through analysis you will be able to identify the factors, which contributed to this success – and use them again to inform future planning. You will become a more skilled professional. Three key questions to keep in mind are:\n- Why do we need it? - What can it tell us? - How can we use it? - supports children’s learning\n- affects future planning\n- contributes to professional development\n- amend your short term planning\n- inform your medium term and long term plans\n- adapt activities to suit the needs of individual children\n- modify tasks to match children’s known abilities\n- provide children with positive and specific feedback as they work and play. The rest of this article provides a route into how effective observation within your setting can raise the level of professionalism amongst your staff. Staff need to be trained in how to observe, how to interpret\ntheir observations and how to use the information they have acquired to inform their future planning and activities. We all know about the importance of observing children as they play, learn and interact with others. We see how they learn as we watch them. We notice the way they approach a problem. We can identify those who methodically try different ways or repeat their actions after a failed attempt. We identify those who give up on the first attempt if it’s not successful or those who are unwilling to try something new. We see what they learn. We can spot steps towards the learning of skills and knowledge. We can see aspects that are proving too tricky at this moment. So what! If your observations stop there, it has all been a waste of your time. ‘Observations are not an end in themselves but a tool for gathering information about a child.’ (Kay 2005, p90)\nWhat happens to your observations? Are they planned, or are your staff simply looking around and chancing upon a child achieving or struggling? If observations are recorded, how is that information then used? Here are some questions, which will help you to focus on what is happening in your setting. They could be a starting point for discussion with your team as you develop your assessment practice. Are observations recorded as soon as possible? - Carry a notebook in your pocket and jot down your observations ready to be recorded later onto your formal documents\n- Keep a card index file – one child per card – in your room and jot down notes\n- Carry Post-it notes to jot down observations to be transferred to formal documents later\nHow often do you observe each child? - Put the names of the children for whom you are the key worker in your notebook, one per page, at the start of each day. Choose two or three of your children per day and observe them all on a rota system. - Allocate one member of the team per session to carry out observations of all of the children at a particular activity, and share the information later. - Put an agreed number of cards in the front of a file index box at the start of each day, and observe those for whom you are the key worker, returning their cards to the back of the box at the end of the day. - Make a weekly check to ensure all children are being observed regularly. Do you observe children at a variety of activities over time? - Focus on one activity per session, having set up a specific activity for this. - Change the focus activity each session so that you cover child-led, adult-led, free and organised, indoor and outdoor, individual and group activities over the week. Are all staff members involved in observations, discussion and planning? - Observations, planning and learning will be more effective if all members of your team are involved. Do you discuss your observations with your colleagues? - Think about your plans: at the end of the week look through your observations together and evaluate the planned activities in relation to your observations. Did the activities allow the children to gain the skills or the knowledge that you intended?","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:61e7bcf5-822f-47ce-9415-e1eca44301cd>"]},{"passage":"Finding Psychological Help for Your Child\nLocating a Therapist\nThe way you find a therapist, psychologist or other mental health professional can be crucial to your child’s success, said Dale Masi, a professor at the University of Maryland graduate school for social work. In her recent book “Shrink to Fit” (Health Communications, $10.95), she suggests seeking referrals from mental health workers you know, your primary physician and people in support groups dealing with the same issues. “You know, most people find a therapist in the telephone book,” she said. “I would not necessarily recommend that.”\nGarnette strongly suggests that parents check with their insurance company or HMO for guidelines about what is covered and for how long. When in doubt about a practitioner, she would turn to a trusted friend. “Your best bet is a friend who operates very much like you do,” Garnette said. Once you have a few names, Masi suggests meeting with the doctors without your child. Go armed with a list of questions and get answers about their education, experience, expertise with children, and the specific issues or diagnoses affecting your child. “You should not feel uncomfortable interviewing a therapist,” Masi said. And think about the office atmosphere. Masi would have doubts about a doctor who claimed to specialize in children, but who had no toys or child-sized furniture in the waiting room. “Definitely look for an expertise in treating children,” Garnette said. “Children are not all little adults. A lot of it has to do with how you just click with a person because it’s so personal.”\nGarnette would also seek someone with a few years’ experience because “you do get better with practice.”\nLeman also recommends finding a therapist who wants to help the child, not finish the payments on his yacht. “Find someone who wants to get rid of you,” he said. “If they’re good, they want the child to be well and take off on his own.”\nHe would also check with the local mental health society or board for any misconduct cases against a professional you’re considering. Don’t expect to rely on one psychiatrist, psychologist or therapist alone. Many cases are best helped by a network of parents and professionals working together on different aspects of the child’s therapy. As a result, Masi suggests asking about affiliations when interviewing the initial professional. “If she’s not a psychiatrist, ask what psychiatrist she works with and if that person is a child psychiatrist,” Masi said. For many cases, experts recommend a comprehensive plan, taking in a few professionals. For example, a plan for a child showing severe attention problems in school might include talk therapy with a family therapist, participation in a social-skills group and drug management through a psychiatrist. “Ideally, you want a situation in which all those people talk to each other and that ‘s really difficult,” Garnette said. The situation is made more difficult by current practices in health management organizations and insurers that often have definite guidelines regarding length of treatment and the types of professional care covered. On average, Garnette says, managed-care companies will pay for 10 to 15 sessions, but it’s often fewer. In advocating for her son, she once threatened a vice president of her HMO with a lawsuit before the company agreed to extra care. “They want to cure everyone in four sessions and it’s just not possible,” Garnette said. And ask up front how long the therapist expects his or her work with your child to continue. Even a rough estimate can help you plan for expenses and the effect on the child and the family, Masi says. Traumatic situations don’t always allow for weeks of planning. However, some don’t require a therapist either, Leman says. In the case of a child grieving after a family member’s death, Leman encourages parents to “give themselves more credit.”\n“Why would a kid want to see a stranger if they’re grieving?” he asked. “Share your imperfect self with your child. It’s healthy for them to see you cry, pray, be concerned. That’s OK.”\nGarnette cautions parents to remain involved in the therapy process so they will see if changes are needed. Her son went through five psychiatrists before he found one that seemed a perfect match. “It’s worth it when you get there,” Garnette said. “Your gut feeling is often right.”\nGuinness, M.

To celebrate the 80 years commemorative mugs and souvenir programmes were provided to all competitors at the finals weekend on June 13 & 14, 2015, and were very well received. Details of the programme which gives information on the history of both the Wilmott Cup and JM Rose Bowl, as well as what was happening in the ETTA in 1935 and other historical information can be found by clicking here. Wilmott Cup (Men)\nThe day started with the No 1 seeds Leamington Spa up against Central London C. After the fourth game it was 2-2 but Leamington took the last game for the win. The second match in that group saw a similar 3-2 scoreline, with Reading beating Leeds. In Round 2, both scores were again 3-2, this time Reading and Leeds were the victors over Central London C and Leamington Spa respectively. Round 3 also saw the same scorelines, all matches being won 3-2, with Reading taking their third win to top the group and Central London C gaining their first victory. So, a three-way countback to decide the final group positions which went down to the number of games won. The final group placings were Reading 1st, Leamington Spa 2nd, Central London C 3rd and Leeds 4th. Meanwhile, on the adjacent tables many similarly close games were taking place. Sheffield, the No 2 seeds, struggled against the Bristol team in their first match and lost by a surprising 4-1. In the other match in this group Guildford defeated Central London B 3-2. Round 2 saw Central London C gain a 3-2 victory over Bristol and Sheffield crept past Guildford for the win in the fifth game. In the final round in the group, Sheffield hit another gear to overcome Central London B 5-0 with Guildford having their second 3-2, win this time against Bristol. Final group placings: Sheffield 1st, Guildford 2nd, London Central B 3rd and Bristol 4th. The two top teams, Sheffield and Reading, faced each other for the title and the trophy. Sheffield went 2-0 up thanks to Warren Li Kam Wa and Michael Fraser, winning their two singles. The doubles went to Reading and then Michael Fraser played a captain’s part to take the fourth and the championship. Guildford had a straight 3-0 win over Leamington Spa to take the bronze medal. London pride was at stake in the derby between the two Central London teams. The final honours went to the B team but only after a titanic struggle which resulted in four games going to four and one to five. Meanwhile, Leeds were defeating Bristol by 3-1 for seventh position. So many games were so close and but for a few points in many matches the play-off matches could have been in a totally different order. All teams won matches and all teams lost matches with Sheffield, the eventual winners, losing to the team who finished eighth, such was the margin between all the teams. Sheffield: Mike Fraser, David Thompson, Warren Li Kam Wa\nReading: Hari Gehlot, Daniel Moses\nGuildford: Chris Bush, Adam Laws\nLeamington Spa: Matthew Outhwaite, Ryan Stockham, James Ward\nCentral London B: Kevin Kan, Andreas Pusch, Hoang Vu\nCentral London C: Fabien Mauroy, Javier Sanchez\nLeeds: Simon Pugh, Richard Smith\nBristol: Martin Gunn, Dave Reeves\nJM Rose Bowl (Ladies)\nLeeds ladies, the No 1 seeds and winner of the trophy in 2013, started their campaign to regain the trophy with a 5-0 victory over Tamworth whilst Leicester, by a narrow margin, defeated Guildford 3-2. Round 2, and Leeds continued their winning ways by defeating Guildford 4-1 and Tamworth had a good 4-1 win over Leicester in the longest match of the day. In the third round, Leeds made it a hat-trick of wins, defeating Leicester 4-1, whilst Tamworth gained their second win, just edging Guildford 3-2. Final group placings: Leeds 1st, Tamworth 2nd, Leicester 3rd, Guildford 4th.

To celebrate the 80 years commemorative mugs and souvenir programmes were provided to all competitors at the finals weekend on June 13 & 14, 2015, and were very well received. Details of the programme which gives information on the history of both the Wilmott Cup and JM Rose Bowl, as well as what was happening in the ETTA in 1935 and other historical information can be found by clicking here. Wilmott Cup (Men)\nThe day started with the No 1 seeds Leamington Spa up against Central London C. After the fourth game it was 2-2 but Leamington took the last game for the win. The second match in that group saw a similar 3-2 scoreline, with Reading beating Leeds. In Round 2, both scores were again 3-2, this time Reading and Leeds were the victors over Central London C and Leamington Spa respectively. Round 3 also saw the same scorelines, all matches being won 3-2, with Reading taking their third win to top the group and Central London C gaining their first victory. So, a three-way countback to decide the final group positions which went down to the number of games won. The final group placings were Reading 1st, Leamington Spa 2nd, Central London C 3rd and Leeds 4th. Meanwhile, on the adjacent tables many similarly close games were taking place. Sheffield, the No 2 seeds, struggled against the Bristol team in their first match and lost by a surprising 4-1. In the other match in this group Guildford defeated Central London B 3-2. Round 2 saw Central London C gain a 3-2 victory over Bristol and Sheffield crept past Guildford for the win in the fifth game. In the final round in the group, Sheffield hit another gear to overcome Central London B 5-0 with Guildford having their second 3-2, win this time against Bristol. Final group placings: Sheffield 1st, Guildford 2nd, London Central B 3rd and Bristol 4th. The two top teams, Sheffield and Reading, faced each other for the title and the trophy. Sheffield went 2-0 up thanks to Warren Li Kam Wa and Michael Fraser, winning their two singles. The doubles went to Reading and then Michael Fraser played a captain’s part to take the fourth and the championship. Guildford had a straight 3-0 win over Leamington Spa to take the bronze medal. London pride was at stake in the derby between the two Central London teams. The final honours went to the B team but only after a titanic struggle which resulted in four games going to four and one to five. Meanwhile, Leeds were defeating Bristol by 3-1 for seventh position. So many games were so close and but for a few points in many matches the play-off matches could have been in a totally different order. All teams won matches and all teams lost matches with Sheffield, the eventual winners, losing to the team who finished eighth, such was the margin between all the teams. Sheffield: Mike Fraser, David Thompson, Warren Li Kam Wa\nReading: Hari Gehlot, Daniel Moses\nGuildford: Chris Bush, Adam Laws\nLeamington Spa: Matthew Outhwaite, Ryan Stockham, James Ward\nCentral London B: Kevin Kan, Andreas Pusch, Hoang Vu\nCentral London C: Fabien Mauroy, Javier Sanchez\nLeeds: Simon Pugh, Richard Smith\nBristol: Martin Gunn, Dave Reeves\nJM Rose Bowl (Ladies)\nLeeds ladies, the No 1 seeds and winner of the trophy in 2013, started their campaign to regain the trophy with a 5-0 victory over Tamworth whilst Leicester, by a narrow margin, defeated Guildford 3-2. Round 2, and Leeds continued their winning ways by defeating Guildford 4-1 and Tamworth had a good 4-1 win over Leicester in the longest match of the day. In the third round, Leeds made it a hat-trick of wins, defeating Leicester 4-1, whilst Tamworth gained their second win, just edging Guildford 3-2. Final group placings: Leeds 1st, Tamworth 2nd, Leicester 3rd, Guildford 4th. No 2 seeds Bristol started well with a 4-1 over Brighton, and Warrington ladies tasted victory by defeating North Herts 3-2.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:c2b81338-22e8-4811-87ee-65a4591f117a>"]}]}

In November of 1713 a turning point was reached in Pope's fortunes. He issued proposals for the publication, by subscription, of a translation of Homer's \"Iliad\" into English verse, with notes. The matter was warmly taken up, and subscriptions poured in apace. His friends stood by him, Swift in particular obtaining a long list of influential patrons. Work was at once begun on the undertaking, and the first four books appeared in 1715, the remaining volumes coming out at intervals in 1716, 1717, 1718, and 1720, when the task was completed. Three years later he undertook the translation of the \"Odyssey\", which, with the aid of Broome and Fenton as collaborators, he completed by 1726. Pope's exact share was twelve books; the rest were by his assistants. By Homer Pope made close on £2000, which, added to what his father had left him, placed him in a position of independence for the remainder of his life. While engaged on his great translation Pope found time for other forms of literary work, and in 1717 he published two of the very best of his lyrics, namely, the \"Elegy to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady\" and the \"Epistle of Eloïsa to Abelard\", and he joined with Gay and Arbuthnot in writing and producing the unsuccessful farce \"Three Hours after Marriage\". He also undertook for Tonson, the publisher, an annotated edition of Shakespeare, which appeared in 1725, a task for which Pope's powers were unequal, for he was not sufficiently versed in the literature of the Elizabethan and Jacobean period, and although the preface is very fine and many shrewd emendations were made in the text, Pope's Shakespeare was on the whole far from being a success. It was at once attacked by Theobald, who thus exposed himself to the characteristic vengeance which Pope was shortly to take by making him the first hero of the \"Dunciad\". In 1713-14 Pope, with Swift, Arbuthnot, and other leaders of the Tory Party, had formed a sort of literary society called the Scriblerus Club, and had amused themselves by burlesquing the vagaries of literature in the \"Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus\", which, although included in the edition of Pope's prose works in 1741, was mainly the composition of Arbuthnot. Arising partly out of the performance of \"Scriblerus\", Pope and Swift published in 1727-28 three volumes of their \"Miscellanies\", which contained among other things Pope's \"Treatise on the Bathos, or the Art of Sinking in Poetry\", illustrated by examples from the inferior poets of the day. These \"Miscellanies\", and particularly the \"Bathos\", drew down upon the authors a torrent of abuse from every quill-driver and poetaster who had been in reality attacked or fancied himself ridiculed. The \"Dunciad\" was in turn the outcome of these invectives. This celebrated satire first appeared, in three books, in May, 1728, and an enlarged edition followed in 1729. In 1742 a further issue appeared with the addition of a fourth book, and in 1743 the poem came out in its final form with Theobald dethroned and Colley Cibber installed in his room as King of the Dunces. The publication of this swinging satire naturally increased the fury against Pope, who was roundly abused in all the moods and tenses. Nor did he shrink from the fray. He gave back blow for blow for eight years, 1730-37, in a weekly sheet, the \"Grub Street Journal\", as well as paying off old scores when opportunity offered in his avowed and more ambitious publications.\n\nFrom 1598 he published his translation of the Iliad in installments. In 1616 the complete Iliad and Odyssey appeared in The Whole Works of Homer, the first complete English translation, which until Pope's was the most popular in the English language and was the way most English speakers encountered these poems. The endeavour was to have been profitable: his patron, Prince Henry, had promised him £300 on its completion plus a pension. However, Henry died in 1612 and his household neglected the commitment, leaving Chapman without either a patron or an income. In an extant letter, Chapman petitions for the money owed him; his petition was ineffective. Chapman's translation of the Odyssey is written in iambic pentameter, whereas his Iliad is written in iambic heptameter. (The Greek original is in dactylic hexameter.) Chapman often extends and elaborates on Homer's original contents to add descriptive detail or moral and philosophical interpretation and emphasis. Chapman's translation of Homer was much admired by John Keats, notably in his famous poem On First Looking into Chapman's Homer, and also drew attention from Samuel Taylor Coleridge and T. S. Eliot. Chapman also translated the Homeric Hymns, the Georgics of Virgil, The Works of Hesiod (1618, dedicated to Francis Bacon), the Hero and Leander of Musaeus (1618), and the Fifth Satire of Juvenal (1624). There is no danger to a man, that knows\nWhat life and death is: there's not any law\nExceeds his knowledge; neither is it lawful\nThat he should stoop to any other law. The English poet John Keats wrote \"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer\" for his friend Charles Cowden Clarke in October 1816. The poem begins \"Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold\" and is much quoted. For example, P. G. Wodehouse in his review of the first Flashman novel that came to his attention: \"Now I understand what that 'when a new planet swims into his ken' excitement is all about.\" Arthur Ransome uses two references from it in his children's books, the Swallows and Amazons series.

At the same time, one can imagine if the host was stingy, the bed hard, the company frigid... six nights would probably have covered it. Today, a standup comic keeps his material flexible so it may be cut, or streached to suit the audience reaction as he, or she performs it. Homer must have done the same thing, streatching, cutting, rephrasing as he went along to suit the audience of the moment. The point is, that THE ILIAD was elastic, and evolving during Homer’s life time. He did not, at some point, sit down and compose the entire Iliad in one great creative burst of imagination. THE ILIAD grew, and evolved, and changed with Homer’s telling, and re-telling of it. Just as the airplane has evolved from the Wright Brothers “Flyer” to the Boeing 747, something the Wright Brothers could never have conceived of, a literary work could in those days, evolve during a single story tellers life time to something quite beyond his comprehension when he began. After Homer’s lifetime “The Sons of Homer” continued performing Homer’s great works for some 200 years, passing the performance from generation to generation in the oral tradition (that is learning it by listening to some one perform it.) and, no doubt, in each generation it was improved to make it more suitable to the individual performers abilities, and audience. This continued until the sixth century BC, the time of the Tyrant Peisistratus. By this time it is said every village has its own performer of THE ILIAD, and each one of them has a slightly different version to tell. This offended Peisistratus who felt there should be only one version of THE ILIAD, the official, authenticated, version. This he set out to create, or have created. He appointed a commission, or its equivalent for those days and assigned them the task of writing it down so no more changes could be made, and while they’re at it, eliminate, cut out, all those improvements made by inferior poets. This was done, and this is the version we have today. One might well ask, if THE ILIAD is based on previous material, and if it evolved before, during, and after Homer’s lifetime, why do we give Homer sole credit for authorship? This is a good question. One scholars have been dealing with for over 2000 years. Here is my opinion: Homer’s greatness lies not so much in his poetry, or in his selection of every word of THE ILIAD, and THE ODYSSEY. Though the selection of those words and the order in which he selected them make THE ILIAD one of the greatest works of art by man. His greatness lies in what he did to the art and craft of story telling. He made two improvements which changed forever the course of Western literature, and in some ways changed the way Man perceives himself. Since before the time of Homer and through to today, the art and craft of story telling is basically narrative. That is the story teller tells who, what, when, where, why, and how. He uses lots of colorful adjectives, and adverbs, throws in some sound bites and he has his story. The “news writer” of today working in television, or newspaper, uses the same art and craft. If he is a story teller of the Bronze age, he composes it in a poetic meter so that it may be more easily memorized and passed on. This “narrative” form has served well for thousands of years. Homer’s first improvement was to change the narrative form into what scholars today call the dramatic. That is he expands, and extends the “sound bite” from a quote describing what the person said into a prolonged speech which is spoken in the first person, present tense. These speeches allow the narrator to not just report what was said, but to become the person saying it. And, as he assumes the character, and expresses the passion of the speaker, the audience can see deep into the heart and soul of the character. They can see his hidden agendas, the honesty of his emotion, the truth of his motives, the value of his character. Homer’s second improvement was one which allowed the first one to work.\n\n'The Iliad WASN'T written by a man named Homer': Historian claims the name referred to a group of storytellers - and that they lived 1,000 years earlier than thought\n- Adam Nicolson says Homer was a tradition of storytelling not a single man\n- He believes The Iliad is 1,000 years older than dates for when Homer lived\n- He says the poems began as stories that were shared and refined orally\n- He began studying Homer ten years ago after being caught in a storm\n- Mr Nicolson has written a book on how Homer should be interpreted today\nThe ancient Greek poet Homer was not a single person but actually an entire culture of storytelling, a historian has claimed. Adam Nicolson, an author and historian who has studied Homer, believes the epic poems of The Iliad and The Odyssey have their origins around 2,000 BC - 1,000 years earlier than the man who wrote them is said to have lived. Instead, he claims the stories evolved as a tradition that were shared and refined as spoken poems for hundreds of years. Little is known about who Homer, seen here in an idealised marble bust from the Roman period, really was\nSpeaking in an interview with National Geographic, Mr Nicolson, who is the Fifth Baron Carnock, said that the idea of Homer as a single author has emerged due to an 'author obsession'. He said: 'I think it's a mistake to think of Homer as a person. Homer is an \"it\" - a tradition. Adam Nicolson has written a book about what Homer can tell us about life in the modern world\n'An entire culture coming up with ever more refined and ever more understanding ways of telling stories that are important to it.' There is very little known about exactly who or what Homer was, but is believed by the ancient Greeks to have been the first great epic poet. Some accounts claim he was a blind poet who lived between 1,102BC to 850BC. A guild of singing story tellers, or rhapsodes, later emerged known as the Homeridae and has led some to argue that Homer was actually a mythical figure whose name was derived from the guild. Some of the earliest written works attributed to Homer were found with the mummified remains of Green Egyptians from around 150-200 BC. The oldest complete Iliad manuscript is found in the doge's library in Venice and is thought to date from 900AD. Mr Nicolson, who lives in Kent, said that notes in the margins of this manuscript, which was created in the Constantinople-Byzantium, provide some clues to what the origin of the Iliad may have been. He said: 'One of the exciting things that emerge from that is that in the early days it seems there was no such thing as a single Iliad, no one fixed text, but this wild and variable tradition of the stories, with many different versions in different parts of the Mediterranean, endlessly interacting with itself, like a braided stream in the mountains.' Mr Nicolson said he first became interested in Homer around ten years ago when he began reading The Odyssey while waiting for his yacht to be repaired after it was damaged in a storm while sailing up the west coast of Britain. He describes reading The Odyssey as being like somebody 'telling me what it was like to be alive on Earth'. Homer is depicted as a blind bard in this painting by Jean-Baptiste August Leloir, held at the Louvre in Paris\nEarly written accounts of The Iliad, like this 5th or 6th Century codex in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, are very rare and the stories are thought to have been passed down by oral storytelling for hundreds of years\nAdam Nicolson, seen here during his BBC series on the history of British whale hunting, first read Homer's Odyssey while waiting for repairs on his yacht and believes Odysseus is a 'metaphor for all of our lives'\nLEGEND OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE WAS BASED ON REAL GOLD MINERS\nThe ancient Greek legend of Jason and his Argonauts' quest for the Golden Fleece may have been based on a real expedition to an ancient kingdom on the Black Sea. The story is thought to have been in circulation even at the time of Homer and was thought to have been a myth.\n\nWhen did Homer write the Iliad? Usually considered to have been written down circa the 8th century BC, the Iliad is among the oldest extant works of Western literature, along with the Odyssey, another epic poem attributed to Homer which tells of Odysseus’s experiences after the events of the Iliad. Is the Iliad older than the Bible? No. The Iliad and Odyssey predate the Bible by several hundred years. Was the Iliad written before the Odyssey? The Iliad is the earlier work (it was written first) . Also the events in the Odyssey are a direct consequence of what happens in the Iliad and the reader of the Odyssey is assumed to know the summary of the plot in the Iliad and who the main characters are. Why did Homer write Iliad? Homer probably wished he could have witnessed the events of the Trojan War, but the actual battle dates more than 400 years before there was ever any mention of the poet Homer. Who Killed Achilles? The story of Achilles is one of the most important legends in Greek mythology. Achilles was said to have died from a heel wound as the result of a poisoned arrow shot by Paris, Hector’s brother (see Figure 2). Is the Iliad true? As the historical sources – Herodotus and Eratosthenes – show, it was generally assumed to have been a real event. According to Homer’s Iliad, the conflict between the Greeks – led by Agamemnon, King of Mycenae – and the Trojans – whose king was Priam – took place in the Late Bronze Age, and lasted 10 years. How old is the Iliad now? The text is Homer’s “Iliad,” and Homer — if there was such a person — probably wrote it in 762 B.C., give or take 50 years, the researchers found. The “Iliad” tells the story of the Trojan War — if there was such a war — with Greeks battling Trojans. Is the Iliad The oldest book? The Epic of Gilgamesh is the oldest known piece of literature in the world. Written in 2100 BCE it predates Homer’s Iliad by 1500 years. What does the word Iliad mean? 1a: a series of miseries or disastrous events. b: a series of exploits regarded as suitable for an epic. 2: a long narrative especially: an epic in the Homeric tradition. Is the Iliad hard to read? For the first-time reader, probably the hardest thing about Homer’s Iliad is its language. And once you get past the weird cultural details (reading the introduction to your edition will help), the poem is extremely accessible. The characters are vivid, and every reader will find someone to identify with. Is the Iliad a good read? It’s battle scenes are majestic, yet heartbreaking in it’s understanding of human tragedy, life and fate. It’s a beautifully deep work, it’s timeless and there is so much that can be learnt from it. Originally Answered: Is The Iliad worth reading? Yes, definitely. Is Troy based on a true story? No, ‘Troy‘ is not based on a true story. However, the film is based on the epic poem ‘The Iliad. What is the moral lesson of the Iliad? The Iliad, the story of the Trojan War, offers several moral lessons to its readers, including the importance of leaders treating their soldiers with respect, the importance of accepting apologies, and the need for respecting family bonds.

Frontispiece engraving for The Whole Works of Homer (1616) attributed to William Hole\nHitchin, Hertfordshire, England\n|Died||12 May 1634\n|Notable works||Bussy D'Ambois, Translations of Homer|\nGeorge Chapman (c. 1559 – 12 May 1634) was an English dramatist, translator, and poet. He was a classical scholar whose work shows the influence of Stoicism. Chapman has been identified as the Rival Poet of Shakespeare's sonnets by William Minto, and as an anticipator of the Metaphysical Poets of the 17th century. Chapman is best remembered for his translations of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, and the Homeric Batrachomyomachia. Life and work\nChapman was born at Hitchin in Hertfordshire. There is conjecture that he studied at Oxford but did not take a degree, though no reliable evidence affirms this. We know very little about Chapman's early life, but Mark Eccles uncovered records that reveal much about Chapman's difficulties and expectations. In 1585 Chapman was approached in a friendly fashion by John Wolfall, Sr., who offered to supply a bond of surety for a loan to furnish Chapman money \"for his proper use in Attendance upon the then Right Honorable Sir Rafe Sadler Knight.\" Chapman's courtly ambitions led him into a trap. He apparently never received any money, but he would be plagued for many years by the papers he had signed. Wolfall had the poet arrested for debt in 1600, and when in 1608 Wolfall's son, having inherited his father's papers, sued yet again, Chapman's only resort was to petition the Court of Chancery for equity. As Sadler died in 1587 this gives Chapman little time to have trained under him, it seems more likely that he was in Sadler's household from 1577-83 as he dedicates all his Homerical translations to Sadler. He spent the early 1590s abroad, seeing military action in the Low Countries. His earliest published works were the obscure philosophical poems The Shadow of Night (1594) and Ovid's Banquet of Sense (1595). The latter has been taken as a response to the erotic poems of the age such as Philip Sidney's Astrophil and Stella and Shakespeare's Venus and Adonis. Chapman's life was troubled by debt and his inability to find a patron whose fortunes did not decline. Chapman's erstwhile patrons Robert Devereux, Second Earl of Essex and the Prince of Wales, Prince Henry, each met their ends prematurely; the former was executed for treason by Elizabeth I in 1601, and the latter died of typhoid fever at the age of eighteen in 1612. Chapman's resultant poverty did not diminish his ability or his standing among his fellow Elizabethan poets and dramatists. Chapman died in London, having lived his latter years in poverty and debt. He was buried at St Giles in the Fields, a monument to him designed by Inigo Jones marked his tomb, and stands today inside the church. By the end of the 1590s, Chapman had become a successful playwright, working for Philip Henslowe and later for the Children of the Chapel. Among his comedies are The Blind Beggar of Alexandria (1596; printed 1598), An Humorous Day's Mirth (1597; printed 1599), All Fools (printed 1605), Monsieur D'Olive (1605; printed 1606), The Gentleman Usher (printed 1606) May Day (printed 1611), and The Widow's Tears (printed 1612). His plays show a willingness to experiment with dramatic form: An Humorous Day's Mirth was one of the first plays to be written in the style of 'humours comedy' which Ben Jonson later used in Every Man in his Humour and Every Man Out of his Humour. With The Widow's Tears he was also one of the first writers to meld comedy with more serious themes, creating the tragicomedy later made famous by Beaumont and Fletcher. He also wrote one noteworthy play in collaboration. Eastward Ho (1605), written with Jonson and John Marston, contained satirical references to the Scots which landed Chapman and Jonson in jail.\n\nReviews for Iliad\nLibrary Journal Reviews 1990 August #1\nWhy another Iliad? Just as Homer's work existed most fully in its performance, so the Homeric texts call periodically for new translations. With this in mind, Fagles offers a new verse rendering of the Iliad. Maneuvering between the literal and the literary, he tries with varying degrees of success to suggest the vigor and manner of the original while producing readable poetry in English. Thus, he avoids the anachronizing of Robert Fitzgerald's translation, while being more literal than Richard Lattimore's. Fagles's efforts are accompanied by a long and penetrating introduction by Bernard Knox, coupled with detailed glossary and textual notes.-- T.L. Cooksey, Armstrong State Coll., Savannah, Ga. Copyright 1990 Cahners Business Information.\n\nHe was hardly an impartial observer of the world he wrote about and often gives personal opinions at length on various people, customs, and events. While his admiration for Homer is always evident, he freely questioned the historical truth of The Iliad, asking why the Achaeans would wage so lengthy and costly a campaign as the Trojan War on behalf of one woman. This is only one of many examples of Herodotus’ personality displaying itself in his work. That he held himself in quite high regard is apparent in the prologue to the Histories which begins, “These are the researches of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, which he publishes, in the hope of thereby preserving from decay the remembrance of what men have done, and of preventing the great and wonderful actions of the Greeks and the Barbarians from losing their due meed of glory; and withal to put on record what were their grounds of feuds” (Histories, I.1). Unlike other ancient writers (such as Homer, earlier, or Virgil, later), Herodotus does not attribute his narrative to divine sources, nor call on such for assistance, but announces clearly that this is his work and no others. His high opinion of himself is also displayed in what is recorded as the first `publication’ of the Histories at the Olympic Games. Works at this time were `published’ by being read aloud and the Greek writer Lucian of Samosata (125-180 CE) claims that Herodotus read the entirety of his work to the audience in one sitting and received great applause. Another version of the publication of the work, however, claims that Herodotus refused to read his book to the crowd until there was ample cloud cover to shade him on the platform. While he waited, the audience left, and this event is what gave rise to the maxim, “Like Herodotus and his shade” (alluding to one who misses an opportunity by waiting for propitious circumstances). Whichever account is true, if either is, they both reflect the esteem Herodotus was known to hold himself in. While little is known of the details of his life, it seems certain that he came from a wealthy, aristocratic family in Asia Minor who could afford to pay for his education. His skill in writing is thought to be evidence of a thorough course in the best schools of his day. He wrote in Ionian Greek and was clearly well read. His ability to travel, seemingly at will, also argues for a man of some means. It is thought he served in the army as a Hoplite in that his descriptions of battle are quite precise and always told from the point of view of a foot soldier. He came to live in the Greek Colony of Thurii, in Italy, where he edited and revised the Histories later in life. He had also lived in Athens and, at some point, it is thought he returned there. Scholars consider it likely that he died in Athens of the plague sometime between 425 and 413 BCE. His fame was so great that many different cities (Athens and Thurii among them) claimed to be the site of his funeral and grave and monuments were erected in his honor. The lasting significance of his work continues to be appreciated by millions of people today and he is considered a primary source for reliable information on the ancient world he observed and wrote about.

The work achieved some popularity, and was reprinted several times, the last in 1797.

In November of 1713 a turning point was reached in Pope's fortunes. He issued proposals for the publication, by subscription, of a translation of Homer's \"Iliad\" into English verse, with notes. The matter was warmly taken up, and subscriptions poured in apace. His friends stood by him, Swift in particular obtaining a long list of influential patrons. Work was at once begun on the undertaking, and the first four books appeared in 1715, the remaining volumes coming out at intervals in 1716, 1717, 1718, and 1720, when the task was completed. Three years later he undertook the translation of the \"Odyssey\", which, with the aid of Broome and Fenton as collaborators, he completed by 1726. Pope's exact share was twelve books; the rest were by his assistants. By Homer Pope made close on £2000, which, added to what his father had left him, placed him in a position of independence for the remainder of his life. While engaged on his great translation Pope found time for other forms of literary work, and in 1717 he published two of the very best of his lyrics, namely, the \"Elegy to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady\" and the \"Epistle of Eloïsa to Abelard\", and he joined with Gay and Arbuthnot in writing and producing the unsuccessful farce \"Three Hours after Marriage\". He also undertook for Tonson, the publisher, an annotated edition of Shakespeare, which appeared in 1725, a task for which Pope's powers were unequal, for he was not sufficiently versed in the literature of the Elizabethan and Jacobean period, and although the preface is very fine and many shrewd emendations were made in the text, Pope's Shakespeare was on the whole far from being a success. It was at once attacked by Theobald, who thus exposed himself to the characteristic vengeance which Pope was shortly to take by making him the first hero of the \"Dunciad\". In 1713-14 Pope, with Swift, Arbuthnot, and other leaders of the Tory Party, had formed a sort of literary society called the Scriblerus Club, and had amused themselves by burlesquing the vagaries of literature in the \"Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus\", which, although included in the edition of Pope's prose works in 1741, was mainly the composition of Arbuthnot. Arising partly out of the performance of \"Scriblerus\", Pope and Swift published in 1727-28 three volumes of their \"Miscellanies\", which contained among other things Pope's \"Treatise on the Bathos, or the Art of Sinking in Poetry\", illustrated by examples from the inferior poets of the day. These \"Miscellanies\", and particularly the \"Bathos\", drew down upon the authors a torrent of abuse from every quill-driver and poetaster who had been in reality attacked or fancied himself ridiculed. The \"Dunciad\" was in turn the outcome of these invectives. This celebrated satire first appeared, in three books, in May, 1728, and an enlarged edition followed in 1729. In 1742 a further issue appeared with the addition of a fourth book, and in 1743 the poem came out in its final form with Theobald dethroned and Colley Cibber installed in his room as King of the Dunces. The publication of this swinging satire naturally increased the fury against Pope, who was roundly abused in all the moods and tenses. Nor did he shrink from the fray. He gave back blow for blow for eight years, 1730-37, in a weekly sheet, the \"Grub Street Journal\", as well as paying off old scores when opportunity offered in his avowed and more ambitious publications.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:d6be2450-699b-4573-87d2-9ebc4f0d58c3>"]},{"passage":"From 1598 he published his translation of the Iliad in installments. In 1616 the complete Iliad and Odyssey appeared in The Whole Works of Homer, the first complete English translation, which until Pope's was the most popular in the English language and was the way most English speakers encountered these poems. The endeavour was to have been profitable: his patron, Prince Henry, had promised him £300 on its completion plus a pension. However, Henry died in 1612 and his household neglected the commitment, leaving Chapman without either a patron or an income. In an extant letter, Chapman petitions for the money owed him; his petition was ineffective. Chapman's translation of the Odyssey is written in iambic pentameter, whereas his Iliad is written in iambic heptameter. (The Greek original is in dactylic hexameter.) Chapman often extends and elaborates on Homer's original contents to add descriptive detail or moral and philosophical interpretation and emphasis. Chapman's translation of Homer was much admired by John Keats, notably in his famous poem On First Looking into Chapman's Homer, and also drew attention from Samuel Taylor Coleridge and T. S. Eliot. Chapman also translated the Homeric Hymns, the Georgics of Virgil, The Works of Hesiod (1618, dedicated to Francis Bacon), the Hero and Leander of Musaeus (1618), and the Fifth Satire of Juvenal (1624). There is no danger to a man, that knows\nWhat life and death is: there's not any law\nExceeds his knowledge; neither is it lawful\nThat he should stoop to any other law. The English poet John Keats wrote \"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer\" for his friend Charles Cowden Clarke in October 1816. The poem begins \"Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold\" and is much quoted. For example, P. G. Wodehouse in his review of the first Flashman novel that came to his attention: \"Now I understand what that 'when a new planet swims into his ken' excitement is all about.\" Arthur Ransome uses two references from it in his children's books, the Swallows and Amazons series.

At the same time, one can imagine if the host was stingy, the bed hard, the company frigid... six nights would probably have covered it. Today, a standup comic keeps his material flexible so it may be cut, or streached to suit the audience reaction as he, or she performs it. Homer must have done the same thing, streatching, cutting, rephrasing as he went along to suit the audience of the moment. The point is, that THE ILIAD was elastic, and evolving during Homer’s life time. He did not, at some point, sit down and compose the entire Iliad in one great creative burst of imagination. THE ILIAD grew, and evolved, and changed with Homer’s telling, and re-telling of it. Just as the airplane has evolved from the Wright Brothers “Flyer” to the Boeing 747, something the Wright Brothers could never have conceived of, a literary work could in those days, evolve during a single story tellers life time to something quite beyond his comprehension when he began. After Homer’s lifetime “The Sons of Homer” continued performing Homer’s great works for some 200 years, passing the performance from generation to generation in the oral tradition (that is learning it by listening to some one perform it.) and, no doubt, in each generation it was improved to make it more suitable to the individual performers abilities, and audience. This continued until the sixth century BC, the time of the Tyrant Peisistratus. By this time it is said every village has its own performer of THE ILIAD, and each one of them has a slightly different version to tell. This offended Peisistratus who felt there should be only one version of THE ILIAD, the official, authenticated, version. This he set out to create, or have created. He appointed a commission, or its equivalent for those days and assigned them the task of writing it down so no more changes could be made, and while they’re at it, eliminate, cut out, all those improvements made by inferior poets. This was done, and this is the version we have today. One might well ask, if THE ILIAD is based on previous material, and if it evolved before, during, and after Homer’s lifetime, why do we give Homer sole credit for authorship? This is a good question. One scholars have been dealing with for over 2000 years. Here is my opinion: Homer’s greatness lies not so much in his poetry, or in his selection of every word of THE ILIAD, and THE ODYSSEY. Though the selection of those words and the order in which he selected them make THE ILIAD one of the greatest works of art by man. His greatness lies in what he did to the art and craft of story telling. He made two improvements which changed forever the course of Western literature, and in some ways changed the way Man perceives himself. Since before the time of Homer and through to today, the art and craft of story telling is basically narrative. That is the story teller tells who, what, when, where, why, and how. He uses lots of colorful adjectives, and adverbs, throws in some sound bites and he has his story. The “news writer” of today working in television, or newspaper, uses the same art and craft. If he is a story teller of the Bronze age, he composes it in a poetic meter so that it may be more easily memorized and passed on. This “narrative” form has served well for thousands of years. Homer’s first improvement was to change the narrative form into what scholars today call the dramatic. That is he expands, and extends the “sound bite” from a quote describing what the person said into a prolonged speech which is spoken in the first person, present tense. These speeches allow the narrator to not just report what was said, but to become the person saying it. And, as he assumes the character, and expresses the passion of the speaker, the audience can see deep into the heart and soul of the character. They can see his hidden agendas, the honesty of his emotion, the truth of his motives, the value of his character. Homer’s second improvement was one which allowed the first one to work.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:bc6d0d4a-886d-49ee-9c0f-26597634f183>"]},{"passage":"'The Iliad WASN'T written by a man named Homer': Historian claims the name referred to a group of storytellers - and that they lived 1,000 years earlier than thought\n- Adam Nicolson says Homer was a tradition of storytelling not a single man\n- He believes The Iliad is 1,000 years older than dates for when Homer lived\n- He says the poems began as stories that were shared and refined orally\n- He began studying Homer ten years ago after being caught in a storm\n- Mr Nicolson has written a book on how Homer should be interpreted today\nThe ancient Greek poet Homer was not a single person but actually an entire culture of storytelling, a historian has claimed.

Instead, he claims the stories evolved as a tradition that were shared and refined as spoken poems for hundreds of years. Little is known about who Homer, seen here in an idealised marble bust from the Roman period, really was\nSpeaking in an interview with National Geographic, Mr Nicolson, who is the Fifth Baron Carnock, said that the idea of Homer as a single author has emerged due to an 'author obsession'. He said: 'I think it's a mistake to think of Homer as a person. Homer is an \"it\" - a tradition. Adam Nicolson has written a book about what Homer can tell us about life in the modern world\n'An entire culture coming up with ever more refined and ever more understanding ways of telling stories that are important to it.' There is very little known about exactly who or what Homer was, but is believed by the ancient Greeks to have been the first great epic poet. Some accounts claim he was a blind poet who lived between 1,102BC to 850BC. A guild of singing story tellers, or rhapsodes, later emerged known as the Homeridae and has led some to argue that Homer was actually a mythical figure whose name was derived from the guild. Some of the earliest written works attributed to Homer were found with the mummified remains of Green Egyptians from around 150-200 BC. The oldest complete Iliad manuscript is found in the doge's library in Venice and is thought to date from 900AD. Mr Nicolson, who lives in Kent, said that notes in the margins of this manuscript, which was created in the Constantinople-Byzantium, provide some clues to what the origin of the Iliad may have been. He said: 'One of the exciting things that emerge from that is that in the early days it seems there was no such thing as a single Iliad, no one fixed text, but this wild and variable tradition of the stories, with many different versions in different parts of the Mediterranean, endlessly interacting with itself, like a braided stream in the mountains.' Mr Nicolson said he first became interested in Homer around ten years ago when he began reading The Odyssey while waiting for his yacht to be repaired after it was damaged in a storm while sailing up the west coast of Britain. He describes reading The Odyssey as being like somebody 'telling me what it was like to be alive on Earth'.

Usually considered to have been written down circa the 8th century BC, the Iliad is among the oldest extant works of Western literature, along with the Odyssey, another epic poem attributed to Homer which tells of Odysseus’s experiences after the events of the Iliad. Is the Iliad older than the Bible? No. The Iliad and Odyssey predate the Bible by several hundred years. Was the Iliad written before the Odyssey? The Iliad is the earlier work (it was written first) . Also the events in the Odyssey are a direct consequence of what happens in the Iliad and the reader of the Odyssey is assumed to know the summary of the plot in the Iliad and who the main characters are. Why did Homer write Iliad? Homer probably wished he could have witnessed the events of the Trojan War, but the actual battle dates more than 400 years before there was ever any mention of the poet Homer. Who Killed Achilles? The story of Achilles is one of the most important legends in Greek mythology. Achilles was said to have died from a heel wound as the result of a poisoned arrow shot by Paris, Hector’s brother (see Figure 2). Is the Iliad true? As the historical sources – Herodotus and Eratosthenes – show, it was generally assumed to have been a real event. According to Homer’s Iliad, the conflict between the Greeks – led by Agamemnon, King of Mycenae – and the Trojans – whose king was Priam – took place in the Late Bronze Age, and lasted 10 years. How old is the Iliad now? The text is Homer’s “Iliad,” and Homer — if there was such a person — probably wrote it in 762 B.C., give or take 50 years, the researchers found. The “Iliad” tells the story of the Trojan War — if there was such a war — with Greeks battling Trojans. Is the Iliad The oldest book? The Epic of Gilgamesh is the oldest known piece of literature in the world. Written in 2100 BCE it predates Homer’s Iliad by 1500 years. What does the word Iliad mean? 1a: a series of miseries or disastrous events. b: a series of exploits regarded as suitable for an epic. 2: a long narrative especially: an epic in the Homeric tradition. Is the Iliad hard to read? For the first-time reader, probably the hardest thing about Homer’s Iliad is its language. And once you get past the weird cultural details (reading the introduction to your edition will help), the poem is extremely accessible. The characters are vivid, and every reader will find someone to identify with. Is the Iliad a good read? It’s battle scenes are majestic, yet heartbreaking in it’s understanding of human tragedy, life and fate. It’s a beautifully deep work, it’s timeless and there is so much that can be learnt from it. Originally Answered: Is The Iliad worth reading? Yes, definitely. Is Troy based on a true story? No, ‘Troy‘ is not based on a true story. However, the film is based on the epic poem ‘The Iliad. What is the moral lesson of the Iliad? The Iliad, the story of the Trojan War, offers several moral lessons to its readers, including the importance of leaders treating their soldiers with respect, the importance of accepting apologies, and the need for respecting family bonds.

Frontispiece engraving for The Whole Works of Homer (1616) attributed to William Hole\nHitchin, Hertfordshire, England\n|Died||12 May 1634\n|Notable works||Bussy D'Ambois, Translations of Homer|\nGeorge Chapman (c. 1559 – 12 May 1634) was an English dramatist, translator, and poet. He was a classical scholar whose work shows the influence of Stoicism. Chapman has been identified as the Rival Poet of Shakespeare's sonnets by William Minto, and as an anticipator of the Metaphysical Poets of the 17th century. Chapman is best remembered for his translations of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, and the Homeric Batrachomyomachia. Life and work\nChapman was born at Hitchin in Hertfordshire. There is conjecture that he studied at Oxford but did not take a degree, though no reliable evidence affirms this. We know very little about Chapman's early life, but Mark Eccles uncovered records that reveal much about Chapman's difficulties and expectations. In 1585 Chapman was approached in a friendly fashion by John Wolfall, Sr., who offered to supply a bond of surety for a loan to furnish Chapman money \"for his proper use in Attendance upon the then Right Honorable Sir Rafe Sadler Knight.\" Chapman's courtly ambitions led him into a trap. He apparently never received any money, but he would be plagued for many years by the papers he had signed. Wolfall had the poet arrested for debt in 1600, and when in 1608 Wolfall's son, having inherited his father's papers, sued yet again, Chapman's only resort was to petition the Court of Chancery for equity. As Sadler died in 1587 this gives Chapman little time to have trained under him, it seems more likely that he was in Sadler's household from 1577-83 as he dedicates all his Homerical translations to Sadler. He spent the early 1590s abroad, seeing military action in the Low Countries. His earliest published works were the obscure philosophical poems The Shadow of Night (1594) and Ovid's Banquet of Sense (1595). The latter has been taken as a response to the erotic poems of the age such as Philip Sidney's Astrophil and Stella and Shakespeare's Venus and Adonis. Chapman's life was troubled by debt and his inability to find a patron whose fortunes did not decline. Chapman's erstwhile patrons Robert Devereux, Second Earl of Essex and the Prince of Wales, Prince Henry, each met their ends prematurely; the former was executed for treason by Elizabeth I in 1601, and the latter died of typhoid fever at the age of eighteen in 1612. Chapman's resultant poverty did not diminish his ability or his standing among his fellow Elizabethan poets and dramatists. Chapman died in London, having lived his latter years in poverty and debt. He was buried at St Giles in the Fields, a monument to him designed by Inigo Jones marked his tomb, and stands today inside the church. By the end of the 1590s, Chapman had become a successful playwright, working for Philip Henslowe and later for the Children of the Chapel. Among his comedies are The Blind Beggar of Alexandria (1596; printed 1598), An Humorous Day's Mirth (1597; printed 1599), All Fools (printed 1605), Monsieur D'Olive (1605; printed 1606), The Gentleman Usher (printed 1606) May Day (printed 1611), and The Widow's Tears (printed 1612). His plays show a willingness to experiment with dramatic form: An Humorous Day's Mirth was one of the first plays to be written in the style of 'humours comedy' which Ben Jonson later used in Every Man in his Humour and Every Man Out of his Humour. With The Widow's Tears he was also one of the first writers to meld comedy with more serious themes, creating the tragicomedy later made famous by Beaumont and Fletcher. He also wrote one noteworthy play in collaboration. Eastward Ho (1605), written with Jonson and John Marston, contained satirical references to the Scots which landed Chapman and Jonson in jail.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:58ceca8e-8be6-4741-a419-2dc78e9a3cfd>"]},{"passage":"Reviews for Iliad\nLibrary Journal Reviews 1990 August #1\nWhy another Iliad? Just as Homer's work existed most fully in its performance, so the Homeric texts call periodically for new translations. With this in mind, Fagles offers a new verse rendering of the Iliad. Maneuvering between the literal and the literary, he tries with varying degrees of success to suggest the vigor and manner of the original while producing readable poetry in English. Thus, he avoids the anachronizing of Robert Fitzgerald's translation, while being more literal than Richard Lattimore's.

While his admiration for Homer is always evident, he freely questioned the historical truth of The Iliad, asking why the Achaeans would wage so lengthy and costly a campaign as the Trojan War on behalf of one woman. This is only one of many examples of Herodotus’ personality displaying itself in his work. That he held himself in quite high regard is apparent in the prologue to the Histories which begins, “These are the researches of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, which he publishes, in the hope of thereby preserving from decay the remembrance of what men have done, and of preventing the great and wonderful actions of the Greeks and the Barbarians from losing their due meed of glory; and withal to put on record what were their grounds of feuds” (Histories, I.1). Unlike other ancient writers (such as Homer, earlier, or Virgil, later), Herodotus does not attribute his narrative to divine sources, nor call on such for assistance, but announces clearly that this is his work and no others. His high opinion of himself is also displayed in what is recorded as the first `publication’ of the Histories at the Olympic Games. Works at this time were `published’ by being read aloud and the Greek writer Lucian of Samosata (125-180 CE) claims that Herodotus read the entirety of his work to the audience in one sitting and received great applause. Another version of the publication of the work, however, claims that Herodotus refused to read his book to the crowd until there was ample cloud cover to shade him on the platform. While he waited, the audience left, and this event is what gave rise to the maxim, “Like Herodotus and his shade” (alluding to one who misses an opportunity by waiting for propitious circumstances). Whichever account is true, if either is, they both reflect the esteem Herodotus was known to hold himself in. While little is known of the details of his life, it seems certain that he came from a wealthy, aristocratic family in Asia Minor who could afford to pay for his education. His skill in writing is thought to be evidence of a thorough course in the best schools of his day. He wrote in Ionian Greek and was clearly well read. His ability to travel, seemingly at will, also argues for a man of some means. It is thought he served in the army as a Hoplite in that his descriptions of battle are quite precise and always told from the point of view of a foot soldier. He came to live in the Greek Colony of Thurii, in Italy, where he edited and revised the Histories later in life. He had also lived in Athens and, at some point, it is thought he returned there. Scholars consider it likely that he died in Athens of the plague sometime between 425 and 413 BCE. His fame was so great that many different cities (Athens and Thurii among them) claimed to be the site of his funeral and grave and monuments were erected in his honor. The lasting significance of his work continues to be appreciated by millions of people today and he is considered a primary source for reliable information on the ancient world he observed and wrote about.

Nashville has recorded 7.59 inches of rain in February through Tuesday, 4.79 inches above normal for the same time period according to National Weather Service meteorologist Faith Borden. The next several days could bring 2-3 inches of additional rain through Saturday for most of the region and possibly more in isolated areas, Borden said. Northwestern portions of Middle Tennessee may get the higher totals that could range from 3 to 5 inches of rain through Saturday. Slightly lesser amounts of rainfall are expected along the Cumberland Plateau with 1-2 inches forecast, according to the National Weather Service. A flood watch is in effect for multiple counties in the region that include Davidson, Sumner and Williamson, which Borden said could be extended. The Cumberland River in Nashville and Stones River in Donelson are elevated and with the rain forecast could return to above flood stage, Borden said.

Water in the Opryland Hotel. Water covering LP Field (Titan Stadium). Water downtown. Water where very few people had ever seen it and where no one expected it. Unbelievalbe. Nashville rises on the banks of the Cumberland River and the double digit deluge is moving downstream. Conditions are particularly treacherous at Lake Barkley and Kentucky Lake, which are formed from the Cumberland River and Tennessee River, respectively. Both Kentucky Lake and Lake Barkley were about 366 feet Tuesday. That’s seven feet above normal summer pool. They were expected to be summer pool (359) + 10 feet by Saturda\nAs a precaution, most of the facilities at the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area (that’s the heavily forrested strip of federal land that separates Kentucky Lake and Lake Barkley) are closed, including most boat ramps, campgrounds and secondary roads.

But in exercising the sensors of those test probes, we made the remarkable discovery that there is water in the Cumberland! At first, we were sure that it had to be a faulty reading or a broken instrument, but seven different tests on multiple instruments confirmed the finding!”\nNASA scientists revealed that their findings indicate that the Cumberland River’s elemental make-up contains a staggering 14% water content. The rest, they say, is a mix of spilled beer from Dancin’ In the District concerts in the 1990s, misplaced Red Bulls from various marathons and 5Ks, discarded flyers from your neighbor’s set at Tin Roof, an as-yet-unclassified semi-gaseous element which they are currently calling “Nashvillium”, and the tears of frustrated Titan’s fans. The science team claim they have been withholding their findings for several years until now, so as not to tip off the public that seeking water was an objective of their search on Mars.

What Can Trees Do For Nashville? Nashville’s impervious surfaces have increased by 20% over the past 2 decades in urban areas at a cost in excess of $100 billion nationally. Local governments are increasingly looking toward non-built storm water management strategies, including trees to reduce the cost of constructing storm water control infrastructure. Some of the intercepted water evaporates back into the atmosphere, and some soaks into the ground reducing the total amount of runoff that must be managed in urban areas. Trees also slow storm flow, reducing the volume of water that a containment facility must store. For example, in the Metropolitan Washington DC region, the existing 46 % tree canopy reduces the need for retention structures by 949 million cubic feet, valued at $4.7 billion per 20-year construction cycle (based on a $5\/cubic foot construction cost). What can I Do For Nashville's Urban Canopy? · Help Nashville get more roots in the ground! The Cumberland River Compact, Nashville Tree Foundation, and many other environmental non-profits in Nashville offer free trees from September – April each year. · Keep an eye out for Emerald Ash Borer and alert a Metro Tree Advisory member if you spot it! This tiny terror is responsible for wiping out Ash trees all over North America and is expected to cost Tennessee billions. Contact Root Nashville\nfor more information! OUR COMMITMENT TO RESTORING NASHVILLE’S URBAN CANOPY\nTrees are a remarkably effective and low-cost solution to water pollution, so we are working with the Nashville Tree Foundation, the Tennessee Environmental Council, several Metro Nashville Departments, and a conglomerate other citizen groups to collectively restore Nashville’s tree canopy. The plan is to plant 500,000 trees between now and 2050, and we have committed to being responsible for at least 10,000 trees between 2016 and 2021. So far, we have planted approximately 6,000 trees and we plan to meet (and possibly exceed) our target of ten thousand before 2021! URBAN CANOPY MAINTENANCE PROGRAM\nThe restoration of our urban canopy is dependent upon regular watering of newly planted trees—especially during the first two summers. A recent survey of park trees planted in 2015 and 2016 showed a 60% survival rate; which indicates that newly planted trees with no maintenance plan in place are at a higher risk of fatality. So, we decided to start a program to do just that! We officially launched the long-awaited Urban Canopy Maintenance Program in December of 2017! This program was established to help care for young trees all over Nashville, and anyone can enroll their trees. Each maintenance package includes one year of watering, pruning, and data collection–and for every paid maintenance package, we are donating a year of maintenance to a tree in the area with greater impermeable surface area, lower canopy coverage, higher average surface temperatures, or socioeconomic disadvantage. There are thousands of trees planted every year in Nashville, and they need a lot of water in their first few years of life to establish a healthy root system. Unfortunately, they often don’t receive the care they require to flourish or even survive. The goal of the Urban Canopy Maintenance Program is to increase their survival rate so that Nashville can continue to restore and expand its urban canopy. PROGRAM FEES & BENEFITS\nFor each paid maintenance package, the Cumberland River Compact will donate one year of maintenance to a tree in need. $90\/year per tree includes:\n- Regular watering\n- Pruning of suckers and shoots\n- Data collection & reporting\nSee if you qualify for\nThe Compact’s Tree Water Maintenance Program! Email Heather Listermann\nwith the following info:\nNumber of Trees\nTree Age (Approx)\nTREE CARE TIPS\nHOW OFTEN DO I NEED TO WATER MY TREE? Young trees need approximately one inch of water per week. During dry times it is important to water your tree at least once a week, sometimes even twice. Always water the tree slowly so the water has time to soak into the soil.\n\nHigh surf usually associated with this level of flooding may pound some oceanside structures like piers, boardwalks, docks, and lifeguard stations apart. Beach houses may be damaged by water and surf, especially if lacking stilts. Major Flood Stage\n- Rivers: significant to catastrophic, life-threatening flooding is usually expected at this stage. Extensive flooding with some low-lying areas completely inundated is likely. Structures may be completely submerged. Large-scale evacuations may be necessary. - Coastlines: Water surges over not only the dune, but also man-made walls and roads. Large and destructive waves pound weak structures to bits and severely damage well-built homes and businesses. Overwash occurs on high-level seawalls. If major flooding occurs at high tide, impacts may be felt well inland. If cities are at or below sea level, catastrophic flooding can inundate the entire city and cause millions or billions of dollars in damage (such as occurred in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina). Record Flood Stage\n- Rivers: at this level, the river is at its highest that it has been since records began for the area where the stream gauge is located. This does not necessarily imply a major flood. Some areas may have never experienced major flooding, and thus record stage is in the moderate category. - Coastlines: Usually, record flooding at the coast is associated with tropical cyclones, but it may be associated with coastal storms, Nor'easters, seiches caused by earthquakes, strong thunderstorms, or tsunamis. Destruction is often extensive and may extend a far distance inland. - \"Glossary - National Weather Service\". weather.gov.

If the two species are listed, and if critical habitat is finalized as it is proposed, the draft economic analysis suggests a range of economic impacts that are possible as a result. In addition to opening a public comment period on the draft economic analysis, the Service is re-opening a public comment period on the proposal to designate critical habitat for these mussels under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) for 30 days by May 29, 2013, in order to allow comments on the draft analysis and the proposed critical habitat designation. The Service first released the proposed critical habitat designation for public comment in October 2012. The fluted kidneyshell and the slabside pearlymussel are only found in portions of the Cumberland and Tennessee River systems of Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia. They have both been eliminated from more than 60 percent of the total number of streams where they historically lived. Only a handful of populations of both species are considered biologically viable. The primary reasons for these mussels’ decline include impoundments, mining, oil and gas exploration, sedimentation, chemical contaminants, temperature alterations, recurring drought and flooding, population fragmentation and isolation, loss of fish hosts, and the introduced, invasive Asian clam. The economic analysis estimates the total incremental cost of critical habitat designation to be up to $3.5 million over 20 years. These costs stem from the requirement for federal agencies to consult with the Service regarding the impacts of their actions, or those that they fund or authorize, on critical habitat. Other sectors of the economy likely to be subject to the impacts include commercial, industrial, residential, utility development, agricultural, and recreational development. The majorities of these costs are administrative and may be borne by federal and state agencies; however, some costs may be incurred by local governments and businesses if federal funding or a federal permit is involved. Critical habitat is a term defined in the ESA. It refers to specific geographic areas that are essential to the conservation of a threatened or endangered species and which may require special management considerations or protection. The designation of critical habitat on private land has no impact on private landowner activities that do not require federal funding or permits. In total, the Service is proposing 27 critical habitat units encompassing 1,380 miles (2,218 km) in Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia for the fluted kidneyshell and slabside pearlymussel. Some of the units overlap and are proposed critical habitat for both species. Here are the proposed critical habitat designations for each mussel. For the fluted kidneyshell, the Service is proposing 24 critical habitat units encompassing 1,182 miles (1,899 km) of stream channel in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia. For the slabside pearlymussel, thirteen critical habitat units encompassing 971 miles (1,562 km) of stream channel in Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia are proposed for the slabside pearlymussel. The fluted kidneyshell’s proposed designation includes eight streams of unoccupied habitat. There are no unoccupied streams designated for the slabside pearlymussel. All streams proposed as critical habitat are occupied by one of these species, or by another previously listed mussel species. Unoccupied habitats provide additional habitat for population expansion and promote genetic diversity, which will decrease the risk of extinction for these two species. For example, the Elk, Holston, and French Broad rivers are being proposed as unoccupied critical habitat for the fluted kidneyshell. This species was once found in these areas.\n\nFor example, though there are a variety of methods to minimize the impact (including fish ladders and in-take screens), fish and other organisms can be injured and killed by turbine blades. Apart from direct contact, there can also be wildlife impacts both within the dammed reservoirs and downstream from the facility. Reservoir water is usually more stagnant than normal river water. As a result, the reservoir will have higher than normal amounts of sediments and nutrients, which can cultivate an excess of algae and other aquatic weeds. These weeds can crowd out other river animal and plant-life, and they must be controlled through manual harvesting or by introducing fish that eat these plants . In addition, water is lost through evaporation in dammed reservoirs at a much higher rate than in flowing rivers. In addition, if too much water is stored behind the reservoir, segments of the river downstream from the reservoir can dry out. Thus, most hydroelectric operators are required to release a minimum amount of water at certain times of year. If not released appropriately, water levels downstream will drop and animal and plant life can be harmed. In addition, reservoir water is typically low in dissolved oxygen and colder than normal river water. When this water is released, it could have negative impacts on downstream plants and animals. To mitigate these impacts, aerating turbines can be installed to increase dissolved oxygen and multi-level water intakes can help ensure that water released from the reservoir comes from all levels of the reservoir, rather than just the bottom (which is the coldest and has the lowest dissolved oxygen). Like many things we do, eat or get in contact with in our life, is not about absolute good or absolute bad. There are good practices and bad practices. The right thing in the wrong place generates conflicts as well as the opposite. Normally the main question is not what but instead how, how much and for how long.\n\nThe mixing of air and water, usually by bubbling air through water or by contact of water with air. The elevation that is used to help maintain a relative balance among tributary storage reservoirs. When water is drawn from tributary reservoirs, the balancing guide ensures that water is drawn equitably from each one, leaving the reservoirs at a similar position between the flood guide and the balancing guide. Cubic feet per second, typically used as a measure of flow in a stream. A cubic foot is equivalent to about 7.5 gallons. A measure of 1,000 cfs is equal to about 7,500 gallons of water per second. A marked nine-foot-draft navigation channel suitable for barge transportation on the Tennessee River and its tributaries. A measure of the volume of water accumulated at a flow rate of one cubic foot per second running for one day. A storage tank with a capacity of about 650,000 gallons would be required to store one day-second-foot of water. The oxygen dissolved in water that is necessary to sustain aquatic life. It is usually measured in milligrams per liter (mg\/L) or parts per million (ppm). In the direction of a stream's current\nThe process of lowering the water level in a reservoir. Drawdown is usually measured in feet. The spring period of lessening runoff, when reservoirs are filled at a rate designed to maintain flood storage and reach targeted summer pool elevations\nThe volume, or capacity, in a reservoir that is reserved for the storage of floodwater. Flood guide level\nThe elevation of a reservoir above which the space is reserved for temporary storage of water to help reduce downstream flooding. Water that is located under the surface of the earth. The upstream portion of a watershed. The water elevation immediately upstream of a dam. The study of the distribution and movement of water. The transfer of water out of one river basin for the benefit of a public water system in another river basin. In 2005, the 11 interbasin transfers from the Tennessee River watershed diverted 13.6 million gallons per day. The amount of electric power that is drawn from TVA’s electric system at a given point in time. An enclosed dam chamber with gates at each end that allow water to be admitted and released. The resulting change in water level allows vessels to be raised and lowered so they can pass over non-navigable parts of a river. The locks on the Tennessee River make navigation possible for 652 miles, from Knoxville, Tennessee, to Paducah, Kentucky. Main-river, or main-stem, reservoirs\nReservoirs where the seasonal lowering to provide storage for flood damage reduction is typically less than seven feet. Main-river reservoirs include (upstream to downstream) Fort Loudoun, Watts Bar, Chickamauga, Nickajack, Guntersville, Wheeler, Wilson, Pickwick, and Kentucky. They were designed to serve multiple purposes, especially commercial navigation and hydropower production. An amount of energy that equals one million watt-hours. It is a common measure for electricity use over time. A release from one or more dams provided to meet hydropower production, reservoir level targets, downstream water needs (such as aquatic habitat, water supply, and waste assimilation), and other commitments. Project minimum flows are those required to be released from a specific dam over a specific time period — not the lowest amount of water that TVA can pass through a dam. System minimum flows are those needed at some point in the system to meet specific needs for power, waste assimilation, navigation, and other beneficial uses. Minimum operations guide\nThe system minimum operations guide is a seasonal guide based on the sum of the storage in 10 tributary projects. It is used to determine what level of flow should be released from these projects when additional flow is required to meet downstream needs. Normal operating zone\nThe elevation range within which main-river reservoirs are operated for power production and summer mosquito control. During high-flow periods, the top of the normal operating zone may be exceeded for the regulation of flood flows. A set of guidelines that includes flood guides, minimum flow requirements, water release requirements, and other requirements to meet system operating objectives. Reservoir (pool) level\nThe elevation of the water in a reservoir at a given time, measured in feet above sea level. Reservoir Operations Study\nA study carried out by TVA to determine whether changes in its reservoir operating policies would produce greater overall public value.\n\nThe consequences of the actual amount of warming that we expect to experience are horrifying, and are likely to include 80 to 250 feet of sea level rise and a dust bowl from Kansas to California\nMr. Romm next provides a litany of very bad things that he predicts are likely to occur if we do not implement a set of policies to aggressively restrict emissions. Consider Mr. Romm’s first prediction:\n- Sea level rise of 80 feet to 250 feet at a rate of 6 inches a decade (or more). A 250 foot rise in sea level would be very, very bad. It conjures up the image of massive tidal waves consuming major coastal cities. But this forecast is problematic for at least a couple of reasons. First, I don’t understand its internal logic. At 6 inches per decade, it would take 1,600 years to get to 80 feet, and 5,000 years to get to 250 feet. I assume we are not trying to consider effects in the years 3600 AD to 7000 AD. Second, while Mr. Romm doesn’t provide attribution for this forecast, it isn’t anything like any formal prediction I’ve ever seen from the IPCC. The IPCC is appropriately reserved about making predictions for sea level rise. They don’t provide best estimates by scenario, but just broad ranges. They also caution that the high end of any range is not an absolute maximum. The spread of IPCC projections for sea level rise through about 2100 across all six marker scenarios ranges from a low of 0.18 meters to a high of 0.59 meters. (See WG1 SPM, Table SPM.3) Crudely, these average about 0.4 meters, or about 15 inches total by about 2100. That’s quite a ways from 80 to 250 feet. Consider Mr. Romm’s second prediction:\nMr. Romm links to a blog post about a news report about a single climate simulation model study to support this. (Read the comments section on the page to which Mr. Romm links). The IPCC certainly does make predictions that large amounts of land, especially in Latin America (See WG2 Chapter 13, pages 583 and 597) and some other equatorial areas, will be subject to “desertification processes,” and this would be a serious problem, but I have not seen a claim as dramatic as Mr. Romm’s proceed from the IPCC process. Consider this in the context of Mr. Romm’s closely related prediction, also based on a blog citation of another single study using climate simulation models, for aridity impacts for the U.S.:\n…”a permanent drought by 2050 throughout the Southwest” – levels of aridity comparable to the 1930s Dust Bowl would stretch from Kansas to California. And they were only looking at a 720 ppm case! This is a pretty bleak picture of what, for example, the U.S. will look like: a 21st century army of Joads escaping an interior apocalypse, only to arrive at the coasts to find the cities flooded under hundreds of feet of water. In contrast, here is the complete list of “examples of projected impacts” that the IPCC provides to illustrate the effects of climate change for the continent of North America (See Synthesis Report, Summary for Policymakers, page 11):\n- Warming in western mountains is projected to cause decreased snowpack, more winter flooding and reduced summer flows, exacerbating competition for over-allocated water resources. - In the early decades of the century, moderate climate change is projected to increase aggregate yields of rain-fed agriculture by 5 to 20%, but with important variability among regions. Major challenges are projected for crops that are near the warm end of their suitable range or which depend on highly utilized water resources. - Cities that currently experience heat waves are expected to be further challenged by an increased number, intensity and duration of heat waves during the course of the century, with potential for adverse health impacts. - Coastal communities and habitats will be increasingly stressed by climate change impacts interacting with development and pollution. While serious, this doesn’t sound quite so dramatic. And so on with various other of Mr. Romm’s predictions. The negative consequences of a several degree increase in global temperatures would almost certainly be quite significant. In addition, these consequences would likely be felt disproportionately by poor people in developing countries, especially those near the equator. Exaggerating these effects, however, is not helpful.","passages":[{"passage":"Nashville weather: Sunny skies finally here on Sunday, but river flood threat remains into next week\nCarmen Klapper had barely any warning before a flash flood hit the RV park her family was staying in Saturday evening.

What Can Trees Do For Nashville? Nashville’s impervious surfaces have increased by 20% over the past 2 decades in urban areas at a cost in excess of $100 billion nationally. Local governments are increasingly looking toward non-built storm water management strategies, including trees to reduce the cost of constructing storm water control infrastructure. Some of the intercepted water evaporates back into the atmosphere, and some soaks into the ground reducing the total amount of runoff that must be managed in urban areas. Trees also slow storm flow, reducing the volume of water that a containment facility must store. For example, in the Metropolitan Washington DC region, the existing 46 % tree canopy reduces the need for retention structures by 949 million cubic feet, valued at $4.7 billion per 20-year construction cycle (based on a $5\/cubic foot construction cost).

OUR COMMITMENT TO RESTORING NASHVILLE’S URBAN CANOPY\nTrees are a remarkably effective and low-cost solution to water pollution, so we are working with the Nashville Tree Foundation, the Tennessee Environmental Council, several Metro Nashville Departments, and a conglomerate other citizen groups to collectively restore Nashville’s tree canopy. The plan is to plant 500,000 trees between now and 2050, and we have committed to being responsible for at least 10,000 trees between 2016 and 2021. So far, we have planted approximately 6,000 trees and we plan to meet (and possibly exceed) our target of ten thousand before 2021! URBAN CANOPY MAINTENANCE PROGRAM\nThe restoration of our urban canopy is dependent upon regular watering of newly planted trees—especially during the first two summers. A recent survey of park trees planted in 2015 and 2016 showed a 60% survival rate; which indicates that newly planted trees with no maintenance plan in place are at a higher risk of fatality. So, we decided to start a program to do just that! We officially launched the long-awaited Urban Canopy Maintenance Program in December of 2017! This program was established to help care for young trees all over Nashville, and anyone can enroll their trees. Each maintenance package includes one year of watering, pruning, and data collection–and for every paid maintenance package, we are donating a year of maintenance to a tree in the area with greater impermeable surface area, lower canopy coverage, higher average surface temperatures, or socioeconomic disadvantage. There are thousands of trees planted every year in Nashville, and they need a lot of water in their first few years of life to establish a healthy root system. Unfortunately, they often don’t receive the care they require to flourish or even survive. The goal of the Urban Canopy Maintenance Program is to increase their survival rate so that Nashville can continue to restore and expand its urban canopy. PROGRAM FEES & BENEFITS\nFor each paid maintenance package, the Cumberland River Compact will donate one year of maintenance to a tree in need. $90\/year per tree includes:\n- Regular watering\n- Pruning of suckers and shoots\n- Data collection & reporting\nSee if you qualify for\nThe Compact’s Tree Water Maintenance Program!

If the two species are listed, and if critical habitat is finalized as it is proposed, the draft economic analysis suggests a range of economic impacts that are possible as a result. In addition to opening a public comment period on the draft economic analysis, the Service is re-opening a public comment period on the proposal to designate critical habitat for these mussels under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) for 30 days by May 29, 2013, in order to allow comments on the draft analysis and the proposed critical habitat designation. The Service first released the proposed critical habitat designation for public comment in October 2012. The fluted kidneyshell and the slabside pearlymussel are only found in portions of the Cumberland and Tennessee River systems of Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia. They have both been eliminated from more than 60 percent of the total number of streams where they historically lived. Only a handful of populations of both species are considered biologically viable. The primary reasons for these mussels’ decline include impoundments, mining, oil and gas exploration, sedimentation, chemical contaminants, temperature alterations, recurring drought and flooding, population fragmentation and isolation, loss of fish hosts, and the introduced, invasive Asian clam. The economic analysis estimates the total incremental cost of critical habitat designation to be up to $3.5 million over 20 years. These costs stem from the requirement for federal agencies to consult with the Service regarding the impacts of their actions, or those that they fund or authorize, on critical habitat. Other sectors of the economy likely to be subject to the impacts include commercial, industrial, residential, utility development, agricultural, and recreational development. The majorities of these costs are administrative and may be borne by federal and state agencies; however, some costs may be incurred by local governments and businesses if federal funding or a federal permit is involved. Critical habitat is a term defined in the ESA. It refers to specific geographic areas that are essential to the conservation of a threatened or endangered species and which may require special management considerations or protection. The designation of critical habitat on private land has no impact on private landowner activities that do not require federal funding or permits. In total, the Service is proposing 27 critical habitat units encompassing 1,380 miles (2,218 km) in Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia for the fluted kidneyshell and slabside pearlymussel. Some of the units overlap and are proposed critical habitat for both species. Here are the proposed critical habitat designations for each mussel. For the fluted kidneyshell, the Service is proposing 24 critical habitat units encompassing 1,182 miles (1,899 km) of stream channel in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia. For the slabside pearlymussel, thirteen critical habitat units encompassing 971 miles (1,562 km) of stream channel in Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia are proposed for the slabside pearlymussel. The fluted kidneyshell’s proposed designation includes eight streams of unoccupied habitat. There are no unoccupied streams designated for the slabside pearlymussel. All streams proposed as critical habitat are occupied by one of these species, or by another previously listed mussel species. Unoccupied habitats provide additional habitat for population expansion and promote genetic diversity, which will decrease the risk of extinction for these two species. For example, the Elk, Holston, and French Broad rivers are being proposed as unoccupied critical habitat for the fluted kidneyshell. This species was once found in these areas.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e4126aa3-fdc7-4b9a-8930-183a300c2337>"]},{"passage":"For example, though there are a variety of methods to minimize the impact (including fish ladders and in-take screens), fish and other organisms can be injured and killed by turbine blades.

They were designed to serve multiple purposes, especially commercial navigation and hydropower production. An amount of energy that equals one million watt-hours. It is a common measure for electricity use over time. A release from one or more dams provided to meet hydropower production, reservoir level targets, downstream water needs (such as aquatic habitat, water supply, and waste assimilation), and other commitments. Project minimum flows are those required to be released from a specific dam over a specific time period — not the lowest amount of water that TVA can pass through a dam. System minimum flows are those needed at some point in the system to meet specific needs for power, waste assimilation, navigation, and other beneficial uses. Minimum operations guide\nThe system minimum operations guide is a seasonal guide based on the sum of the storage in 10 tributary projects. It is used to determine what level of flow should be released from these projects when additional flow is required to meet downstream needs. Normal operating zone\nThe elevation range within which main-river reservoirs are operated for power production and summer mosquito control. During high-flow periods, the top of the normal operating zone may be exceeded for the regulation of flood flows. A set of guidelines that includes flood guides, minimum flow requirements, water release requirements, and other requirements to meet system operating objectives. Reservoir (pool) level\nThe elevation of the water in a reservoir at a given time, measured in feet above sea level. Reservoir Operations Study\nA study carried out by TVA to determine whether changes in its reservoir operating policies would produce greater overall public value.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:19f697d4-24a3-413b-bd1b-6fafcbb4b76e>"]},{"passage":"The consequences of the actual amount of warming that we expect to experience are horrifying, and are likely to include 80 to 250 feet of sea level rise and a dust bowl from Kansas to California\nMr. Romm next provides a litany of very bad things that he predicts are likely to occur if we do not implement a set of policies to aggressively restrict emissions. Consider Mr. Romm’s first prediction:\n- Sea level rise of 80 feet to 250 feet at a rate of 6 inches a decade (or more). A 250 foot rise in sea level would be very, very bad. It conjures up the image of massive tidal waves consuming major coastal cities. But this forecast is problematic for at least a couple of reasons. First, I don’t understand its internal logic. At 6 inches per decade, it would take 1,600 years to get to 80 feet, and 5,000 years to get to 250 feet. I assume we are not trying to consider effects in the years 3600 AD to 7000 AD. Second, while Mr. Romm doesn’t provide attribution for this forecast, it isn’t anything like any formal prediction I’ve ever seen from the IPCC. The IPCC is appropriately reserved about making predictions for sea level rise. They don’t provide best estimates by scenario, but just broad ranges. They also caution that the high end of any range is not an absolute maximum. The spread of IPCC projections for sea level rise through about 2100 across all six marker scenarios ranges from a low of 0.18 meters to a high of 0.59 meters. (See WG1 SPM, Table SPM.3) Crudely, these average about 0.4 meters, or about 15 inches total by about 2100. That’s quite a ways from 80 to 250 feet. Consider Mr. Romm’s second prediction:\nMr. Romm links to a blog post about a news report about a single climate simulation model study to support this. (Read the comments section on the page to which Mr. Romm links). The IPCC certainly does make predictions that large amounts of land, especially in Latin America (See WG2 Chapter 13, pages 583 and 597) and some other equatorial areas, will be subject to “desertification processes,” and this would be a serious problem, but I have not seen a claim as dramatic as Mr. Romm’s proceed from the IPCC process. Consider this in the context of Mr. Romm’s closely related prediction, also based on a blog citation of another single study using climate simulation models, for aridity impacts for the U.S.:\n…”a permanent drought by 2050 throughout the Southwest” – levels of aridity comparable to the 1930s Dust Bowl would stretch from Kansas to California. And they were only looking at a 720 ppm case! This is a pretty bleak picture of what, for example, the U.S. will look like: a 21st century army of Joads escaping an interior apocalypse, only to arrive at the coasts to find the cities flooded under hundreds of feet of water. In contrast, here is the complete list of “examples of projected impacts” that the IPCC provides to illustrate the effects of climate change for the continent of North America (See Synthesis Report, Summary for Policymakers, page 11):\n- Warming in western mountains is projected to cause decreased snowpack, more winter flooding and reduced summer flows, exacerbating competition for over-allocated water resources. - In the early decades of the century, moderate climate change is projected to increase aggregate yields of rain-fed agriculture by 5 to 20%, but with important variability among regions. Major challenges are projected for crops that are near the warm end of their suitable range or which depend on highly utilized water resources. - Cities that currently experience heat waves are expected to be further challenged by an increased number, intensity and duration of heat waves during the course of the century, with potential for adverse health impacts. - Coastal communities and habitats will be increasingly stressed by climate change impacts interacting with development and pollution. While serious, this doesn’t sound quite so dramatic. And so on with various other of Mr. Romm’s predictions. The negative consequences of a several degree increase in global temperatures would almost certainly be quite significant. In addition, these consequences would likely be felt disproportionately by poor people in developing countries, especially those near the equator. Exaggerating these effects, however, is not helpful.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:3a3782a7-7a8e-4ec6-a3d3-418ad8ba1154>"]}]}

The demand for highly educated professionals to research and adopt more sustainable methods is greater than ever. In this post, we explain sustainability and give a rundown of degrees and employment available in the area. 1. An urbanist\nUrban planners’ main responsibilities are to help businesses and organisation create plans for the use of land. In the designs of an urban planner, communities, road networks, parks, and the general layout of a city might frequently be given priority. Urban planners also create policies or strategies to handle expanding populations while having the least possible negative environmental effects. 2. Landscape designer\nIn order to integrate man-made structures smoothly with the environment, landscape architects first conduct a survey of the area’s natural geology and topography. It is possible for landscape architects to work on creating animal habitats, distinctive locations, or long-lasting infrastructure systems in both urban and rural settings. 3. Environmental geologists\nResearching alternate sources of energy and resources is a crucial component of projects pertaining to Sustainability Jobs. An environmental geologist is crucial when advising mining and gas corporations on the acquisition and use of energy resources. 4. Environmental advisor\nAn environmental consultant often works on a contract basis with companies in the public or private sectors, such as water treatment plants, environmental agencies, and other businesses whose operations may have an impact on the environment. Environmental consultants can offer advice and planning solutions for issues including soil contamination, air quality, and water pollution. 5. Environmental scientist\nEnvironmental scientists search for the most effective ways to safeguard the environment and advance human health. Environmental scientists frequently conduct research into health and environmental issues, seek to pinpoint their root causes, and develop solutions for these issues in both the public and commercial sectors. An environmental scientist could investigate and examine enigmatic diseases, strange wildlife malformations, or sickness in a population with an unidentified source. Ecologists’ main responsibilities are to investigate and address how human behavior affects and influences the environment. An ecologist may work for environmental nonprofits, doing study and developing solutions to environmental issues brought on by human activity, consumption, and influence on the environment. Ecologists may even be a member of a research team that examines and investigates how community actions such as construction, restoration, and others affect ecosystems. 7. Air quality engineer\nAir quality engineers employ advanced monitoring procedures, chemical and statistical studies, and three-dimensional computer modelling to analyse the air pollution in a specific location. Air quality engineers occasionally develop or alter pollution-control machinery. In order to assess and study the effects of certain activities on the local surroundings, air quality engineers typically focus their efforts in or near big cities. 8. Engineering in the environment\nPrimary responsibilities: Environmental engineers provide solutions to environmental problems by combining environmental information with engineering concepts. Examples of environmental knowledge include soil composition and biological and ecological processes. Environmental engineers may work on initiatives or programmes to enhance public health, waste management and recycling, as well as initiatives to reduce or regulate air and water pollution. 9. Energy supervisor\nThe main responsibilities of energy managers are audits to guarantee effective use of resources, both financial and environmental. They could work for the government or the business sector. In the majority of cases, energy managers discover that the creation of new city projects, municipal plans, and governmental contracts requires their services. Energy managers may also be in charge of reducing the amount of energy and water used by creating projects that adhere to tight design guidelines, statutory requirements, and financial constraints. 10. Engineer in sustainability\nA sustainability engineer’s main responsibilities include developing strategies, evaluating locations, and studying financial data to create and implement renewable energy projects. Although Sustainability Jobs engineers often operate inside, they occasionally need to travel to certain job sites in order to effectively formulate task designs, comprehend necessary job specifications, and get more familiar with the project at hand. Many businesses provide Sustainability Jobs employment, which give the environment hope for a bright future. The prognosis for employment in sustainability will also continue to improve as the population continues to grow and businesses and organisation search for innovative methods to develop, manufacture, and utilise fuel resources in environmentally appropriate applications.\n\nEnergy Analyst (Data modelling)\nDo you have some experience working in the energy management or utilities market? Are you analytical used to data modelling and coding activity? Working with a leading energy company, the Energy Analyst will be a customer facing role supporting B2B customers with their energy management, helping them to manage consumption, achieving monetary savings, and developing opportunities to correct inefficiencies. If you are analytical and a good communicator - the Energy Analyst role could be for you - apply today! Key Responsibilities: Analysis of building and process energy consumption.Apply and develop numerical models to trend and evaluate performance.Produce regular written reports.Alert clients to abnormal usage patterns.Evaluate and verify energy efficiency projects.Continuous development of energy data visualisation techniques.A main point of contact for customers, particularly in highlighting inefficiencies and raising opportunities relating to demand response products.

As more organizations automate internal processes related to sustainability, EHS and energy management, asset management is another area that overlaps. Companies can expect more energy management features in asset management software and may, in some situations, be able to meet their needs with a single application rather than two. Energy management and asset management have different initial aims. Energy management seeks to reduce the energy cost of operating building and factory equipment and is typically the purview of the facilities, energy or operations team at the local, and increasingly, the corporate level. Asset management intends to avoid downtime of production lines and facilities and to save costs and is used by the facilities or operations team at the local level. Historically, energy management and asset management have been separate processes with separate software solutions. However, more teams are realizing a connection between energy management and asset management. Real-time energy consumption and other attribute monitoring can be used to detect problems with roof-top units (RTU) and other HVAC equipment, motors, and fans as well as to identify energy savings opportunities. Several companies now have their asset management team coordinate work with the energy management team. With real-time monitoring of equipment, operators aim to proactively recognize opportunities quickly and to apply preventive maintenance actions before responding to outright equipment failure. Both asset and energy management requires identifying assets, monitoring real-time equipment usage, and alerting operators of problems. Software vendors are responding to this emerging need. Traditional asset management vendors such as IBM\/Maximo and Infor have added initial energy management capabilities and energy management vendors who utilize interval data are adding basic asset management capabilities to their core products. A single software product for each process makes sense. A single master list of equipment (name plate info, age, drawings, etc.) can be used for both asset management and energy management. Proposed and completed maintenance and energy projects can be tracked in one system. Operators and facility managers will receive the same type of alerts and work orders for both maintenance and energy improvements. Such an approach doesn’t fit all situations and associated vendor capabilities are still nascent in many cases. But energy and maintenance leaders should monitor this trend and may find situations where it make sense to add light weight asset management to an energy management implementation or conversely to supplement an asset management deployment with energy monitoring capabilities.

The conventional wisdom is that the current softness in the economy has weakened demand for energy. Ultimately, the nation's energy infrastructure needs to be expanded and upgraded. Additional gas-fired energy plants will tax the gas distribution network, said Graham. A grim outlook\nSo what about the future? Veteran developer Dan Packard, founder and certified property manager of Denver-based PowerSpring, an Internet-based energy information application, is pessimistic. He believes property managers are too passive in seeking solutions for energy costs. Packard cites California's energy crisis as an example. “The West Coast energy issue has been beaten to death,” said Packard. “The expression there by property managers today is that Gov. Gray Davis has stepped in and solved the problem.” Many Americans incorrectly believe the energy crisis is over because the issue currently isn't heavily covered by the media, Packard added. Analysts say property managers across the country have not begun to implement energy solutions for their portfolios to stop the decline in FFO and net operating income attributable to energy costs. “At the present pace, it will be many years before they recognize the needs of their tenants,” Packard said. “Over this period, the best of tenants [those willing to pay the highest rents] will have moved on to other space that offers extensive menus of value-added services, including many energy options,” concluded Packard. “The property manager who is slow to react will be out of a job.”\nSome enlightening energy management tips\nEnergy costs don't always have to rise. Experts say they actually can decrease, if an efficient energy system is put in place. Here are some suggestions from Rob Bagguley, president of property and facilities management at Chicago-based Transwestern Commercial Services, and others to energize the thinking of a real estate owner, operator or manager:\nChill out. Install energy management systems that better control equipment, add efficiency and save power. Air conditioners, for instance, gobble up huge amounts of electricity. Most traditional commercial cooling systems, called chillers, operate during the day when rates are highest. Some property managers have sought to cut costs and conserve energy by running chiller systems during off-peak hours. Think differently. Does cleaning have to be done in the dead of night with different crews on different floors? Bagguley urges building owners to coordinate cleaning staffs. “It's a simple concept,” he explained. “Assemble crews on one floor, complete that floor and then have them move on to another. You'll finish a floor in a shorter time frame.”\nGo back to the basics. For example, if outdoor lighting is automated, use a digital clock that has more accurate timing and reflects changes in daylight-saving time to control the lighting. Turn lights on only when needed and off when they are not in use. Consider motion monitors that trigger the on switch when a person is in the office. Check out a building's equipment. Retrofit air conditioners with energy-efficient machines. Determine when power peaks. If owners or property managers can lower that peak demand, they will significantly affect their rate structure. Stagger times for equipment start-up and shutdown. Instead of using energy in a bell-shaped curve, where energy use starts out flat and then climbs rapidly before falling again, monitor energy usage. Consider alternate sources of power. Rather than obtaining 100% of power from a grid, consider using an on-site generator to control peak costs that could provide 25% to 50% of the energy needed at the site. Not only will such a system reduce costs, but it also could help in an emergency. Owners and operators also could opt for a hybrid system that combines electricity and gas. Take advantage of programs offered by utilities and energy manufacturers. In California and other states, energy companies offer rebate programs to entice owners to replace fluorescent light bulbs with lower-wattage bulbs, thereby creating significant savings. Lighting manufacturers typically offer financing, and the payback can be realized in less than two years. At the same time, tenants see the benefits of their conservation efforts. Get everyone involved with the program. The age of tenants is changing. Generation X is more concerned about energy conservation. Seek to make everyone more conservation-conscious not only from an economic viewpoint, but also from an environmental one. Work with tenants.\n\nWhat Does a Construction Manager Do? Construction managers oversee and lead a range of building projects from beginning to end. They are responsible for setting and keeping schedules, monitoring finances, and making certain that everybody is doing what they should, every day. Construction managers also help ensure that the workplace is free of safety hazards, and they deal with the various working relationships that exist on a job site. Construction Manager Job Statistics\nNearly 75 percent of construction managers in America are independent contractors hired by clients in need of managers with specific work experience. Projects that use construction managers can range from small home renovation and remodeling jobs to larger commercial projects, like office buildings, hospitals, and schools. Many clients require an education background for managers that includes a minimum of a bachelor's degree in a related field. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage in 2017 for construction managers in America was $91,370. Responsibilities of a Construction Manager\nThe specific tasks of a construction manager can vary from project to project, but many roles are standard for the position. Quality management. Construction projects quite often involve a number of contractors and subcontractors. One of the most important jobs of the construction manager is making certain everyone is doing quality work and not cutting any corners along the way. Cost management. A good construction manager is constantly on top of costs and makes the necessary adjustments when unexpected complications or issues arise. Safety management. Construction managers must identify and eliminate possible hazards for the safety of everyone on the job site. Contract administration. It is the job of the construction manager to ensure that every provision of the contract is being met and that all parties involved are satisfied. Beyond everything else, construction managers need to keep all parties involved well informed throughout the whole project. This includes the client, the architect, and any contractor or subcontractors involved. If issues arrive, the manager must be ready to deal with them immediately. Looking to Become a Construction Manager? Being an effective construction manager involves much more than just reading blueprints or spot-checking the quality of work being done. Good ones are knowledgeable about all standard building codes and often must be familiar with the latest construction practices, including environmentally friendly design and building. They need to be adept with industry-specific software and have a good working knowledge of all aspects of the job in general. In addition to work experience, construction managers often must hold at least a bachelor's degree in construction science\/management or a related discipline, such as civil engineering. As part of a related course of study, aspiring construction managers study traditional subjects like statistics, mathematics, architecture, and information technology. They also receive specialized training in subjects like site design and planning, enforcement of building codes, scheduling, and cost estimation. Construction managers possess excellent communication skills and can lead a diverse team that includes everyone involved in the process, from the client, designers, and architects to the site workers and tradespeople. Since most construction environments are fast-paced and projects are held to tight deadlines, the ability to effectively multitask is also a must for a successful construction manager. Finally, clients today increasingly want a certified construction manager for their projects. Once an aspiring manager has some real-world experience, it is in his or her best interest to obtain a few industry certifications. The Construction Management Association of America (CMAA) and American Institute of Constructors (AIC) offer certifications that are in high demand. These certifications are awarded based on a person's education level, real-world experience, and overall knowledge of the principles of construction management coupled with a written exam.","passages":[{"passage":"We are thrilled to announce that our Director of Operations and Energy Engineer, Jason Clark, has met the rigorous testing and requirements to needed to qualify as a Certified Energy Manager.

The demand for highly educated professionals to research and adopt more sustainable methods is greater than ever. In this post, we explain sustainability and give a rundown of degrees and employment available in the area. 1. An urbanist\nUrban planners’ main responsibilities are to help businesses and organisation create plans for the use of land. In the designs of an urban planner, communities, road networks, parks, and the general layout of a city might frequently be given priority. Urban planners also create policies or strategies to handle expanding populations while having the least possible negative environmental effects. 2. Landscape designer\nIn order to integrate man-made structures smoothly with the environment, landscape architects first conduct a survey of the area’s natural geology and topography. It is possible for landscape architects to work on creating animal habitats, distinctive locations, or long-lasting infrastructure systems in both urban and rural settings. 3. Environmental geologists\nResearching alternate sources of energy and resources is a crucial component of projects pertaining to Sustainability Jobs. An environmental geologist is crucial when advising mining and gas corporations on the acquisition and use of energy resources. 4. Environmental advisor\nAn environmental consultant often works on a contract basis with companies in the public or private sectors, such as water treatment plants, environmental agencies, and other businesses whose operations may have an impact on the environment. Environmental consultants can offer advice and planning solutions for issues including soil contamination, air quality, and water pollution. 5. Environmental scientist\nEnvironmental scientists search for the most effective ways to safeguard the environment and advance human health. Environmental scientists frequently conduct research into health and environmental issues, seek to pinpoint their root causes, and develop solutions for these issues in both the public and commercial sectors. An environmental scientist could investigate and examine enigmatic diseases, strange wildlife malformations, or sickness in a population with an unidentified source. Ecologists’ main responsibilities are to investigate and address how human behavior affects and influences the environment. An ecologist may work for environmental nonprofits, doing study and developing solutions to environmental issues brought on by human activity, consumption, and influence on the environment. Ecologists may even be a member of a research team that examines and investigates how community actions such as construction, restoration, and others affect ecosystems. 7. Air quality engineer\nAir quality engineers employ advanced monitoring procedures, chemical and statistical studies, and three-dimensional computer modelling to analyse the air pollution in a specific location. Air quality engineers occasionally develop or alter pollution-control machinery. In order to assess and study the effects of certain activities on the local surroundings, air quality engineers typically focus their efforts in or near big cities. 8. Engineering in the environment\nPrimary responsibilities: Environmental engineers provide solutions to environmental problems by combining environmental information with engineering concepts. Examples of environmental knowledge include soil composition and biological and ecological processes. Environmental engineers may work on initiatives or programmes to enhance public health, waste management and recycling, as well as initiatives to reduce or regulate air and water pollution. 9. Energy supervisor\nThe main responsibilities of energy managers are audits to guarantee effective use of resources, both financial and environmental. They could work for the government or the business sector. In the majority of cases, energy managers discover that the creation of new city projects, municipal plans, and governmental contracts requires their services. Energy managers may also be in charge of reducing the amount of energy and water used by creating projects that adhere to tight design guidelines, statutory requirements, and financial constraints. 10. Engineer in sustainability\nA sustainability engineer’s main responsibilities include developing strategies, evaluating locations, and studying financial data to create and implement renewable energy projects. Although Sustainability Jobs engineers often operate inside, they occasionally need to travel to certain job sites in order to effectively formulate task designs, comprehend necessary job specifications, and get more familiar with the project at hand. Many businesses provide Sustainability Jobs employment, which give the environment hope for a bright future. The prognosis for employment in sustainability will also continue to improve as the population continues to grow and businesses and organisation search for innovative methods to develop, manufacture, and utilise fuel resources in environmentally appropriate applications.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:53eea886-84c3-40a2-a0ba-7d6241685a5d>"]},{"passage":"Energy Analyst (Data modelling)\nDo you have some experience working in the energy management or utilities market?

As more organizations automate internal processes related to sustainability, EHS and energy management, asset management is another area that overlaps. Companies can expect more energy management features in asset management software and may, in some situations, be able to meet their needs with a single application rather than two. Energy management and asset management have different initial aims. Energy management seeks to reduce the energy cost of operating building and factory equipment and is typically the purview of the facilities, energy or operations team at the local, and increasingly, the corporate level. Asset management intends to avoid downtime of production lines and facilities and to save costs and is used by the facilities or operations team at the local level. Historically, energy management and asset management have been separate processes with separate software solutions. However, more teams are realizing a connection between energy management and asset management. Real-time energy consumption and other attribute monitoring can be used to detect problems with roof-top units (RTU) and other HVAC equipment, motors, and fans as well as to identify energy savings opportunities. Several companies now have their asset management team coordinate work with the energy management team. With real-time monitoring of equipment, operators aim to proactively recognize opportunities quickly and to apply preventive maintenance actions before responding to outright equipment failure. Both asset and energy management requires identifying assets, monitoring real-time equipment usage, and alerting operators of problems. Software vendors are responding to this emerging need. Traditional asset management vendors such as IBM\/Maximo and Infor have added initial energy management capabilities and energy management vendors who utilize interval data are adding basic asset management capabilities to their core products. A single software product for each process makes sense. A single master list of equipment (name plate info, age, drawings, etc.) can be used for both asset management and energy management. Proposed and completed maintenance and energy projects can be tracked in one system. Operators and facility managers will receive the same type of alerts and work orders for both maintenance and energy improvements. Such an approach doesn’t fit all situations and associated vendor capabilities are still nascent in many cases. But energy and maintenance leaders should monitor this trend and may find situations where it make sense to add light weight asset management to an energy management implementation or conversely to supplement an asset management deployment with energy monitoring capabilities.

The conventional wisdom is that the current softness in the economy has weakened demand for energy. Ultimately, the nation's energy infrastructure needs to be expanded and upgraded. Additional gas-fired energy plants will tax the gas distribution network, said Graham. A grim outlook\nSo what about the future? Veteran developer Dan Packard, founder and certified property manager of Denver-based PowerSpring, an Internet-based energy information application, is pessimistic. He believes property managers are too passive in seeking solutions for energy costs. Packard cites California's energy crisis as an example. “The West Coast energy issue has been beaten to death,” said Packard. “The expression there by property managers today is that Gov. Gray Davis has stepped in and solved the problem.” Many Americans incorrectly believe the energy crisis is over because the issue currently isn't heavily covered by the media, Packard added. Analysts say property managers across the country have not begun to implement energy solutions for their portfolios to stop the decline in FFO and net operating income attributable to energy costs. “At the present pace, it will be many years before they recognize the needs of their tenants,” Packard said. “Over this period, the best of tenants [those willing to pay the highest rents] will have moved on to other space that offers extensive menus of value-added services, including many energy options,” concluded Packard. “The property manager who is slow to react will be out of a job.”\nSome enlightening energy management tips\nEnergy costs don't always have to rise. Experts say they actually can decrease, if an efficient energy system is put in place. Here are some suggestions from Rob Bagguley, president of property and facilities management at Chicago-based Transwestern Commercial Services, and others to energize the thinking of a real estate owner, operator or manager:\nChill out. Install energy management systems that better control equipment, add efficiency and save power. Air conditioners, for instance, gobble up huge amounts of electricity. Most traditional commercial cooling systems, called chillers, operate during the day when rates are highest. Some property managers have sought to cut costs and conserve energy by running chiller systems during off-peak hours. Think differently. Does cleaning have to be done in the dead of night with different crews on different floors? Bagguley urges building owners to coordinate cleaning staffs. “It's a simple concept,” he explained. “Assemble crews on one floor, complete that floor and then have them move on to another. You'll finish a floor in a shorter time frame.”\nGo back to the basics. For example, if outdoor lighting is automated, use a digital clock that has more accurate timing and reflects changes in daylight-saving time to control the lighting. Turn lights on only when needed and off when they are not in use. Consider motion monitors that trigger the on switch when a person is in the office. Check out a building's equipment. Retrofit air conditioners with energy-efficient machines. Determine when power peaks. If owners or property managers can lower that peak demand, they will significantly affect their rate structure. Stagger times for equipment start-up and shutdown. Instead of using energy in a bell-shaped curve, where energy use starts out flat and then climbs rapidly before falling again, monitor energy usage. Consider alternate sources of power. Rather than obtaining 100% of power from a grid, consider using an on-site generator to control peak costs that could provide 25% to 50% of the energy needed at the site. Not only will such a system reduce costs, but it also could help in an emergency. Owners and operators also could opt for a hybrid system that combines electricity and gas. Take advantage of programs offered by utilities and energy manufacturers. In California and other states, energy companies offer rebate programs to entice owners to replace fluorescent light bulbs with lower-wattage bulbs, thereby creating significant savings. Lighting manufacturers typically offer financing, and the payback can be realized in less than two years. At the same time, tenants see the benefits of their conservation efforts. Get everyone involved with the program. The age of tenants is changing. Generation X is more concerned about energy conservation. Seek to make everyone more conservation-conscious not only from an economic viewpoint, but also from an environmental one. Work with tenants.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:26098a82-34b8-4731-93b6-3abf74a9a634>"]},{"passage":"What Does a Construction Manager Do?

Around 220 B.C., the emperor Shi Huangdi decided to build the Great Wall of China by closing the gaps between smaller walls built by earlier rulers. Hundreds of thousands of peasants were used as forced labor to build the Great Wall. The workers hauled and dumped millions of tons of rubble to fill the core of the wall. From the Yellow Sea in the east to the Gobi desert in the west, the Great Wall twisted and turned for thousands of miles, protecting and isolating China from the barbarian warriors beyond its borders. China's Early History\nChina is the world's oldest continuous civilization. The beginnings of that civilization extend back into the mists of prehistory. Because of China's geography—the long distances that separated it from Europe and other continents—it followed its own direction. EARLY CIVILIZATION AND THE DYNASTIES\nChina has been a settled society for more than 4,000 years. In its earliest days, China was made up of a number of Stone Age cultures. Then it was ruled by dynasties. A dynasty is a series of rulers from the same family. The first Chinese dynasty was the Shang. This dynasty arose during the 1700s B.C. It ruled a central area in China for about 600 years until it was overthrown by the Zhou Dynasty, which ruled part of northern China. The next important dynasty, the Qin (chihn), gave its name to China. In 221 B.C., the Qin Dynasty united a number of smaller states under a strong central government and established an empire. The first Qin emperor was Shi Huangdi, the builder of the Great Wall. The Chinese empire, ruled by different dynasties, lasted for more than 2,000 years. Another important Chinese dynasty was that of the Han. These rulers pushed the empire into central Asia, home to many nomadic tribes. Many other dynasties followed over the centuries. In 1644, the Manchu people of Manchuria invaded China and established the Qing (chihng) Dynasty. In 1911, the Manchus were overthrown by revolutionaries, and this ended the dynasties and the Chinese empire. China Opens Up to the World\nEven though China remained isolated from other regions for centuries, that started to change in the 13th century. At that time, European travelers began to visit China. Marco Polo, for example, traveled from Venice, Italy, to China in the 13th century and wrote a book about his adventures, The Travels of Marco Polo. China and Europe had few contacts until the 19th century, when European powers sought access to Chinese markets. At that point, China had a weak military and an ineffective government. Europeans took advantage of China and forced it to sign a series of treaties that granted special privileges to the Europeans. Consequently, China was carved up into spheres of influence controlled by Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and Japan. This outside control angered China, which burst forth in the Boxer Rebellion of 1900. Chinese militants attacked and killed Europeans and Chinese Christians in China. A multinational force of about 20,000 soldiers finally defeated the Boxers. REVOLUTION AND CHANGE\nAfter the Boxer Rebellion, the Qing Dynasty, founded by the Manchus, attempted to reform the Chinese government, but it was too late. Many individuals and groups wanted to form a republic, which would give the people a voice in their government. In 1912, Sun Yat-sen and others founded the Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party. However, the republic, led by Sun Yat-sen, was undermined by civil war throughout China. When Sun Yat-sen died in 1925, a general named Chiang Kai-shek took over the Nationalist Party. Chiang's troops fought against the warlords of China and united most of the country in the 1920s. However, throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the Chinese Communist Party became an increasingly powerful force in China. The Nationalists and the Communists fought for control of China. In 1949, the Communists, under the leadership of Mao Zedong, finally defeated the Nationalists.\n\nQ: How did you first develop an interest in Chinese languages, history, and culture? A: Serendipity at age 14. At a Magnet High School in Minneapolis, merely by chance I took Chinese language from Margaret Wong, a pedagogic genius who convinced many of us that learning Chinese was urgently necessary, and easy. Teacher Wong's father had fought on the losing side of China's civil war in the 1940s, as a high-ranking Nationalist general close to Chiang Kai-shek. Her war stories from the 1940s mesmerized me, as did her anecdotes about growing up in a powerful household of wartime China, cosmopolitan Shanghai, and political Beijing. Despite Teacher Wong's Nationalist background, she developed strong ties with the new PRC, and thus our Chinese class managed to visit China in 1978, as guests of the Chinese government, six months before the US and China normalized relations in 1979. The only photo I have from that trip is following a basketball game we played with a school team in a mountain village. Our overnight in the mountains was unplanned; that day the military needed our hotel due to the eruption of tensions on the Sino-Soviet border. Following this 1978 trip, I stayed on in Hong Kong, studying language and history at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. My subsequent education at Stanford and Harvard was driven by an obsession with China and learning Chinese. I've been lucky, studying with some of the leading China scholars in the world, and studying intensive Chinese at the preeminent language centers in China and Taiwan. I've also enjoyed non-academic experiences in East Asia, such as acting in movies, helping produce the first Chinese-Japanese TV series, living in a village, on a farmer's roof next to his pigeon coop, and working as a runway model. Q: How long would it take to traverse the entire 3,600 miles of the Yangtze? What would one see of note upstream of the Three Gorges? A: Well, it could take months, as it did for the several million people who walked up the Yangtze from Shanghai to Chongqing, to escape the fighting during World War II. Regarding the historical significance of the Three Gorges and the Yangtze River, bear in mind that China's history, unlike Western history, occurred in a concentrated geographic area. The history of the west is spread out across half the globe, from Mesopotamia, the Mideast, the Mediterranean, Europe, and then North America. By contrast, China's historical experience occurred largely within the area of today's China. This means that China's equivalent of Abraham, Odysseus, Hippocrates, Cleopatra, Caesar, da Vinci, Shakespeare, Isaac Newton, Napoleon, George Washington, and Teddy Roosevelt all lived within a relatively restricted geographical space, especially along China's great river systems. (This is also why the remarkable Terra Cotta warriors of the First Emperor were discovered by chance, by farmers digging a well). The earth is brimming with archeological riches and places such as the Three Gorges are bursting with historical memory and cultural significance. And the lessons of this area continue to excite the modern imagination. Take for example the classic novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguo yanyi), which describes in Homeric detail the adventures inside the Three Gorges of warriors such as Guan Gong (China's Achilles) and the ingenious military strategist Zhu Geliang. This exciting text informed the strategic thinking of Chairman Mao Zedong more than the writings of Marx and Lenin. The blockbuster film \"Red Cliff\" reinterpreted these dramas for the big screen. Recent archeological discoveries of the 'Sanxingdui' culture now posit a competing vision of early Chinese civilization, complicating the Yellow River's age-old claim as the China's \"cradle.\" The role of the Three Gorges in Tang poetry, Song painting, and Ming drama is profound. The Three Gorges are also visually stunning, as are the unspoiled nature reserves in adjacent tributaries feeding the Three Gorges. Finally, to come to terms with contemporary China, one must understand the Three Gorges Dam. Q: When Smithsonian travelers tour a traditional, perhaps millennium old, Beijing \"hutong\" or neighborhood, what should they be especially aware of? Architecture? Layout? Location relative to the Forbidden City?\n\nTwo people that I met in China died recently. Last week it was Huang Hua, once Vice Prime Minister of China, who entertained my father and the members of his family traveling with him in a dining hall in the Forbidden City in Beijing. More on that later. The other was Joan Hinton, whom I met on a collective farm in rural China. My father led a group of American agriculturalists around China for 30 days in 1984. Instead of just visiting the cities, we spent much of our time in the country so that the agricultural scientists could talk with the people running the large farming operations. Joan Hinton and her husband were on a farm that had a large dairy operation that Hinton’s husband, Erwin Engst, had helped build. The couple had raised their children in China and Mrs. Hinton told me that her son, who had returned to the United States for college, had an accent that for some reason was mistaken as German, not Chinese. The Hintons wore Mao jackets, which was curious since this was twelve years after Nixon’s visit and eight years after Mao’s death. Most government officials by then were wearing well-tailored Italian suits. My father said that Engst and others had built a very good dairy operation from scratch, and he was impressed. He did not know anything about Hinton and it was only after her obituary appeared in the New York Times in June of this year that I learned of her connection to the Manhattan project and the suspicion that she may have been a spy. The couple struck me as good natured old lefties of the sort that one could still find in the coffee shops along Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley in the 60s talking about visiting Trotsky in Mexico before his assassination by Stalin's agents. Huang Hua was a very different story and to tell what I know about him requires that I explain why my father was in China in the first place, By the time I went with him in 1984 my father and mother had been to China five times. They had first gone in 1972. When Nixon returned from China my father got a call from Earl Butz, then Secretary of Agriculture, whom my father had known for more than a decade. As my father told it, Butz’s first words were, “You’re going to China.” My father had no connection with China and asked why. “They asked for you,” was Butz’s reply. “But why me?” my father asked. “I don’t know.” In time my father did find out. In the 1950s, he had written up some research he found in a journal published in Hong Kong. The paper had been roughly translated into English and my father saw the results as significant. He wrote about this in several places, but never knew that it had come out of Red China. He told me he had assumed it had been done in Taiwan or Hong Kong. My father’s attention gave the paper international recognition at a time when Chinese research was often ignored by western scientific publications. The Chinese never forgot and when Butz asked if they had a preference about who could lead the first exchange of livestock producers, they asked for my father. So in late 1972 my father went to China. He met several officials and spoke at the University of Beijing, but he spent most of his time talking to the leaders of collective farms. Because he went to parts of China where no American had been for a generation, his return flight was routed through Washington where he was debriefed by someone from the Pentagon. According to my father, he made a lousy spy because, in his words, \"I couldn't tell a missile silo from a grain silo.\" (Actually I'm quite sure he could, but it was probably his way of saying that the debriefing made him uncomfortable. He thought that agriculture should be outside of politics, if not above it.) My father kept going back. Several times he asked me to come with him, but the time required either conflicted with school (I was in law school until 1974) or work. Finally I went in 1984. The dinner in the dining hall in the Forbidden City with Huang Hua and his wife was perhaps the most unique event I have ever attended. My father had been dealing with the Vice Prime Minister for years and the two had become friends, but the rest of us were in awe of the man who had met with Henry Kissinger to bring down the barriers that had separated China from the United States since 1949.\n\nIn India, Alexander smashed a local Indian army and marveled at its elephants. But even as Alexander continued lusting after new discoveries in the East, his men began to rebel. Alexander dreamed of continuing on to China; his men dreamed of going home to Greece. Finally, Alexander gave in, though a report said he retreated to his tent and broke down in sobs of fury and disappointment. Instead of returning as he had come, he marched south to the coast of the Indian Ocean, where he divided his army into three parts. One was to return by ship, while the other two would march overland. The middle route, which Alexander personally led, was across the barren, lifeless stretch of land called the Makran Desert—an area avoided by travelers to this day. Alexander’s men were decimated by the burning sun and parched landscape, but Alexander survived. When he returned to Babylon, Alexander had been in the East for seven years and had conquered most of the known world. But instead of resting, Alexander ordered a fleet to prepare to sail around the Persian coast. Alexander’s dream was never realized. At age 33, he died of disease. Who were the early Chinese explorers? While the empires of the western world were expanding eastward, explorers from the Chinese Empire were venturing west. The first motive of the Chinese was to establish\nBut a second motive emerged after A.D. 400—religion. Buddhism emerged in India in the sixth century B.c. and spread to China. Later, Chinese pilgrims would travel to India to discover more about the Buddha and his teachings. Who was Chang Ch’ien the Chinese explorer? Chang Ch’ien was one of the earliest and most famous Chinese explorers. In 138 B.C., the Emperor Wu Ti sent Ch’ien west on a mission to find allies. But he was captured by China’s enemy, the Huns, and spent ten years in captivity. He escaped and made contact with the Yiieh-chih, a nomadic tribe in what is today Afghanistan. Ch’ien reported back to the Chinese emperor in 116,B.c. Wu Ti sent him on another mission the following year, this time to the Wu-Sun, a tribe that lived in what is today southern Russia. On this journey, Ch’ien compiled information on Fergana, a city in Uzbekistan, and India and Parthia—modem-day Iran. When Ch’ien’s journeys were complete, China had made contact with the civilization established by Alexander the Great. The Roman and Chinese empires began to exchange goods. What was the Silk Road? The Silk Road was a 4,000-mile-long trading route between the civilizations of Rome and China. Caravans carrying Chinese goods—especially silk—traveled out of northwest China, around the burning desert sands of Takla Makan, over the Pamir Mountains north of India, into Mesopotamia, and finally arrived at the eastern end of the Mediterranean. No one group made the trip. Instead, the goods were passed from one group to another, often taking years to reach their destination. The groups inhabiting the middle of the Silk Road made enormous profits from the trade, and they tried to prevent any direct contact between China and the Roman Empire. Who was Fa-hsien the Chinese Buddhist traveller? Fa-hsien was born in the Chinese city of Shansi sometime in the fourth century A.D. As a young man, Fa-hsien became an avid follower of Buddha. He resolved to visit India to see where the Buddha had lived his life and visit temples and shrines of Buddhist teaching. According to an account written by Fa-hsien titled Fo Kua Chi (Record of Buddhist Kingdoms), it took him more than five years to journey from China to central India. “In the desert were numerous evil spirits and scorching winds, causing death to anyone who would meet them,” he wrote. “Above there were no birds, while on the ground there were no animals. One looked as far as one could in all directions for a path to cross, but there was none to choose. Only the dried bones of the dead served as indications.” Fa-hsien wrote of mountains where he climbed sheer cliffs 8,000 feet tall.\n\nThus, by the mid-1980s, even foreigners with a limited knowledge of Chinese could, with the help of colleagues and translators, find out about China's long twentieth-century history of oral history, in much of its diversity and complexity. It seems, though, that this knowledge never entered a broader academic, let alone public, memory. This seeming reluctance to engage with pre-1980s oral history is even more perplexing when considering the article Zuo published in 2015. According to Zuo's article, which is based on Chinese publications and does not reference any English-language articles, oral history existed in China before the 1980s, but not in its \"modern form.\" Zuo writes: \"Modern oral history started in 1948 at Columbia University's Oral History Research Office.… Oral history in China was introduced from the West during the 1980s. Thus, the rise of oral history is a new trend in the development of historical studies in China. \"55 This is also the explanation Zheng Songhui, who described the development of oral history at Chinese libraries in 2008, provided.56 Li Huibo from China Women's University differentiates a first phase of oral history defined by state ideology from a \"second phase, the period beginning in the 1980s, when oral history was 'geared to international standards. '\"57 Her British collaborator on a women's oral history project, Margaretta Jolly, explained: \"Notably, these [standards] reflect not so much a movement away from the explicitly political approach of the earlier era as a complex mix of European Marxist and feminist [End Page 12] ideas of 'history from below,' which was partly disseminated through a visit by socialist British oral historian Paul Thompson in 1986. \"58 This is also what the CCOH staff told me. Considering Stave's and Kwong's articles, I found this assertion that oral history in China began only in the 1980s startling. Zuo argued that current Chinese oral history began only in the mid-1980s, even though oral historians, as he acknowledged, were aware of and informed by earlier research: \"Because of the long tradition of oral history in China and the practice of oral historical research as well as the oral interviews since 1949, Chinese scholars did not feel unfamiliar with the Western concept of oral history when it was introduced into China in the 1980s. The Western theory and method of oral history were smoothly accepted and quickly modified to integrate into the Chinese practice of the oral historical interview.… In 1986, Jing Shun published the first academic article to introduce to Chinese readers the theory and methods of oral history used in Europe and the United States. \"59 But Zuo did not explain what differentiated Chinese and Western oral history practices or what made the latter \"modern.\" Zuo argued that since the 1980s, oral history in China has developed along \"two basic tracks.\" One included historians using oral history in order to find out about the past; the other included a smaller group of oral historians exploring the theoretical underpinnings of oral history. \"Through the combined efforts of these two groups of scholars,\" he notes, \"oral history quickly took off as a new branch of the discipline of history in China. \"60 In Beijing, I met a few oral historians who had been conducting interviews since the 1980s. Ding Yizhuang, for example, interviewed Manchu women and old Beijingers in the 1990s and published several volumes of their narratives.61 Chen Mo has been interviewing Chinese filmmakers. Both later published books on oral history theory and method. Throughout the Oral History in China Conference they, like others, did not refer to any of the earlier work. Instead, they seemed to agree that oral history in China had begun only in the 1980s and that China now needed to catch up to the standards the West developed. Only Chu Hong-yuan from Taiwan called upon his colleagues not to focus exclusively on Western models but also to remember their own history—without referencing, however, any specific studies, projects, or scholars. As I have noted before, oral historians around the world often lack an awareness—let alone detailed knowledge—of their field's [End Page 13] history.62 I do not know enough about oral history in China to say whether such a paradox exists there, but it may be worth investigating, because it might have implications for the development of future studies. Some of the more troubling implications are discussed in the following section.

Around 220 B.C., the emperor Shi Huangdi decided to build the Great Wall of China by closing the gaps between smaller walls built by earlier rulers. Hundreds of thousands of peasants were used as forced labor to build the Great Wall. The workers hauled and dumped millions of tons of rubble to fill the core of the wall. From the Yellow Sea in the east to the Gobi desert in the west, the Great Wall twisted and turned for thousands of miles, protecting and isolating China from the barbarian warriors beyond its borders. China's Early History\nChina is the world's oldest continuous civilization. The beginnings of that civilization extend back into the mists of prehistory. Because of China's geography—the long distances that separated it from Europe and other continents—it followed its own direction. EARLY CIVILIZATION AND THE DYNASTIES\nChina has been a settled society for more than 4,000 years. In its earliest days, China was made up of a number of Stone Age cultures. Then it was ruled by dynasties. A dynasty is a series of rulers from the same family. The first Chinese dynasty was the Shang. This dynasty arose during the 1700s B.C. It ruled a central area in China for about 600 years until it was overthrown by the Zhou Dynasty, which ruled part of northern China. The next important dynasty, the Qin (chihn), gave its name to China. In 221 B.C., the Qin Dynasty united a number of smaller states under a strong central government and established an empire. The first Qin emperor was Shi Huangdi, the builder of the Great Wall. The Chinese empire, ruled by different dynasties, lasted for more than 2,000 years. Another important Chinese dynasty was that of the Han. These rulers pushed the empire into central Asia, home to many nomadic tribes. Many other dynasties followed over the centuries. In 1644, the Manchu people of Manchuria invaded China and established the Qing (chihng) Dynasty. In 1911, the Manchus were overthrown by revolutionaries, and this ended the dynasties and the Chinese empire. China Opens Up to the World\nEven though China remained isolated from other regions for centuries, that started to change in the 13th century. At that time, European travelers began to visit China. Marco Polo, for example, traveled from Venice, Italy, to China in the 13th century and wrote a book about his adventures, The Travels of Marco Polo. China and Europe had few contacts until the 19th century, when European powers sought access to Chinese markets. At that point, China had a weak military and an ineffective government. Europeans took advantage of China and forced it to sign a series of treaties that granted special privileges to the Europeans. Consequently, China was carved up into spheres of influence controlled by Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and Japan. This outside control angered China, which burst forth in the Boxer Rebellion of 1900. Chinese militants attacked and killed Europeans and Chinese Christians in China. A multinational force of about 20,000 soldiers finally defeated the Boxers. REVOLUTION AND CHANGE\nAfter the Boxer Rebellion, the Qing Dynasty, founded by the Manchus, attempted to reform the Chinese government, but it was too late. Many individuals and groups wanted to form a republic, which would give the people a voice in their government. In 1912, Sun Yat-sen and others founded the Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party. However, the republic, led by Sun Yat-sen, was undermined by civil war throughout China. When Sun Yat-sen died in 1925, a general named Chiang Kai-shek took over the Nationalist Party. Chiang's troops fought against the warlords of China and united most of the country in the 1920s. However, throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the Chinese Communist Party became an increasingly powerful force in China. The Nationalists and the Communists fought for control of China. In 1949, the Communists, under the leadership of Mao Zedong, finally defeated the Nationalists.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:66cb3526-7f58-4c0f-a904-c7c1bcb5cd8f>"]},{"passage":"Q: How did you first develop an interest in Chinese languages, history, and culture? A: Serendipity at age 14. At a Magnet High School in Minneapolis, merely by chance I took Chinese language from Margaret Wong, a pedagogic genius who convinced many of us that learning Chinese was urgently necessary, and easy. Teacher Wong's father had fought on the losing side of China's civil war in the 1940s, as a high-ranking Nationalist general close to Chiang Kai-shek. Her war stories from the 1940s mesmerized me, as did her anecdotes about growing up in a powerful household of wartime China, cosmopolitan Shanghai, and political Beijing. Despite Teacher Wong's Nationalist background, she developed strong ties with the new PRC, and thus our Chinese class managed to visit China in 1978, as guests of the Chinese government, six months before the US and China normalized relations in 1979. The only photo I have from that trip is following a basketball game we played with a school team in a mountain village. Our overnight in the mountains was unplanned; that day the military needed our hotel due to the eruption of tensions on the Sino-Soviet border. Following this 1978 trip, I stayed on in Hong Kong, studying language and history at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. My subsequent education at Stanford and Harvard was driven by an obsession with China and learning Chinese. I've been lucky, studying with some of the leading China scholars in the world, and studying intensive Chinese at the preeminent language centers in China and Taiwan. I've also enjoyed non-academic experiences in East Asia, such as acting in movies, helping produce the first Chinese-Japanese TV series, living in a village, on a farmer's roof next to his pigeon coop, and working as a runway model. Q: How long would it take to traverse the entire 3,600 miles of the Yangtze? What would one see of note upstream of the Three Gorges? A: Well, it could take months, as it did for the several million people who walked up the Yangtze from Shanghai to Chongqing, to escape the fighting during World War II. Regarding the historical significance of the Three Gorges and the Yangtze River, bear in mind that China's history, unlike Western history, occurred in a concentrated geographic area. The history of the west is spread out across half the globe, from Mesopotamia, the Mideast, the Mediterranean, Europe, and then North America. By contrast, China's historical experience occurred largely within the area of today's China. This means that China's equivalent of Abraham, Odysseus, Hippocrates, Cleopatra, Caesar, da Vinci, Shakespeare, Isaac Newton, Napoleon, George Washington, and Teddy Roosevelt all lived within a relatively restricted geographical space, especially along China's great river systems. (This is also why the remarkable Terra Cotta warriors of the First Emperor were discovered by chance, by farmers digging a well). The earth is brimming with archeological riches and places such as the Three Gorges are bursting with historical memory and cultural significance. And the lessons of this area continue to excite the modern imagination. Take for example the classic novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguo yanyi), which describes in Homeric detail the adventures inside the Three Gorges of warriors such as Guan Gong (China's Achilles) and the ingenious military strategist Zhu Geliang. This exciting text informed the strategic thinking of Chairman Mao Zedong more than the writings of Marx and Lenin. The blockbuster film \"Red Cliff\" reinterpreted these dramas for the big screen. Recent archeological discoveries of the 'Sanxingdui' culture now posit a competing vision of early Chinese civilization, complicating the Yellow River's age-old claim as the China's \"cradle.\" The role of the Three Gorges in Tang poetry, Song painting, and Ming drama is profound. The Three Gorges are also visually stunning, as are the unspoiled nature reserves in adjacent tributaries feeding the Three Gorges. Finally, to come to terms with contemporary China, one must understand the Three Gorges Dam.

Last week it was Huang Hua, once Vice Prime Minister of China, who entertained my father and the members of his family traveling with him in a dining hall in the Forbidden City in Beijing. More on that later. The other was Joan Hinton, whom I met on a collective farm in rural China. My father led a group of American agriculturalists around China for 30 days in 1984. Instead of just visiting the cities, we spent much of our time in the country so that the agricultural scientists could talk with the people running the large farming operations. Joan Hinton and her husband were on a farm that had a large dairy operation that Hinton’s husband, Erwin Engst, had helped build. The couple had raised their children in China and Mrs. Hinton told me that her son, who had returned to the United States for college, had an accent that for some reason was mistaken as German, not Chinese. The Hintons wore Mao jackets, which was curious since this was twelve years after Nixon’s visit and eight years after Mao’s death. Most government officials by then were wearing well-tailored Italian suits. My father said that Engst and others had built a very good dairy operation from scratch, and he was impressed. He did not know anything about Hinton and it was only after her obituary appeared in the New York Times in June of this year that I learned of her connection to the Manhattan project and the suspicion that she may have been a spy. The couple struck me as good natured old lefties of the sort that one could still find in the coffee shops along Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley in the 60s talking about visiting Trotsky in Mexico before his assassination by Stalin's agents. Huang Hua was a very different story and to tell what I know about him requires that I explain why my father was in China in the first place, By the time I went with him in 1984 my father and mother had been to China five times. They had first gone in 1972. When Nixon returned from China my father got a call from Earl Butz, then Secretary of Agriculture, whom my father had known for more than a decade. As my father told it, Butz’s first words were, “You’re going to China.” My father had no connection with China and asked why. “They asked for you,” was Butz’s reply. “But why me?” my father asked. “I don’t know.” In time my father did find out. In the 1950s, he had written up some research he found in a journal published in Hong Kong. The paper had been roughly translated into English and my father saw the results as significant. He wrote about this in several places, but never knew that it had come out of Red China. He told me he had assumed it had been done in Taiwan or Hong Kong. My father’s attention gave the paper international recognition at a time when Chinese research was often ignored by western scientific publications. The Chinese never forgot and when Butz asked if they had a preference about who could lead the first exchange of livestock producers, they asked for my father. So in late 1972 my father went to China. He met several officials and spoke at the University of Beijing, but he spent most of his time talking to the leaders of collective farms. Because he went to parts of China where no American had been for a generation, his return flight was routed through Washington where he was debriefed by someone from the Pentagon. According to my father, he made a lousy spy because, in his words, \"I couldn't tell a missile silo from a grain silo.\" (Actually I'm quite sure he could, but it was probably his way of saying that the debriefing made him uncomfortable. He thought that agriculture should be outside of politics, if not above it.) My father kept going back. Several times he asked me to come with him, but the time required either conflicted with school (I was in law school until 1974) or work. Finally I went in 1984. The dinner in the dining hall in the Forbidden City with Huang Hua and his wife was perhaps the most unique event I have ever attended. My father had been dealing with the Vice Prime Minister for years and the two had become friends, but the rest of us were in awe of the man who had met with Henry Kissinger to bring down the barriers that had separated China from the United States since 1949.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:0cf1f3cb-a0bb-477b-b15c-2f956a015ec7>"]},{"passage":"In India, Alexander smashed a local Indian army and marveled at its elephants. But even as Alexander continued lusting after new discoveries in the East, his men began to rebel. Alexander dreamed of continuing on to China; his men dreamed of going home to Greece. Finally, Alexander gave in, though a report said he retreated to his tent and broke down in sobs of fury and disappointment. Instead of returning as he had come, he marched south to the coast of the Indian Ocean, where he divided his army into three parts. One was to return by ship, while the other two would march overland. The middle route, which Alexander personally led, was across the barren, lifeless stretch of land called the Makran Desert—an area avoided by travelers to this day. Alexander’s men were decimated by the burning sun and parched landscape, but Alexander survived. When he returned to Babylon, Alexander had been in the East for seven years and had conquered most of the known world. But instead of resting, Alexander ordered a fleet to prepare to sail around the Persian coast. Alexander’s dream was never realized. At age 33, he died of disease. Who were the early Chinese explorers? While the empires of the western world were expanding eastward, explorers from the Chinese Empire were venturing west. The first motive of the Chinese was to establish\nBut a second motive emerged after A.D. 400—religion. Buddhism emerged in India in the sixth century B.c. and spread to China. Later, Chinese pilgrims would travel to India to discover more about the Buddha and his teachings. Who was Chang Ch’ien the Chinese explorer? Chang Ch’ien was one of the earliest and most famous Chinese explorers. In 138 B.C., the Emperor Wu Ti sent Ch’ien west on a mission to find allies. But he was captured by China’s enemy, the Huns, and spent ten years in captivity. He escaped and made contact with the Yiieh-chih, a nomadic tribe in what is today Afghanistan. Ch’ien reported back to the Chinese emperor in 116,B.c. Wu Ti sent him on another mission the following year, this time to the Wu-Sun, a tribe that lived in what is today southern Russia. On this journey, Ch’ien compiled information on Fergana, a city in Uzbekistan, and India and Parthia—modem-day Iran. When Ch’ien’s journeys were complete, China had made contact with the civilization established by Alexander the Great. The Roman and Chinese empires began to exchange goods. What was the Silk Road? The Silk Road was a 4,000-mile-long trading route between the civilizations of Rome and China. Caravans carrying Chinese goods—especially silk—traveled out of northwest China, around the burning desert sands of Takla Makan, over the Pamir Mountains north of India, into Mesopotamia, and finally arrived at the eastern end of the Mediterranean. No one group made the trip. Instead, the goods were passed from one group to another, often taking years to reach their destination. The groups inhabiting the middle of the Silk Road made enormous profits from the trade, and they tried to prevent any direct contact between China and the Roman Empire. Who was Fa-hsien the Chinese Buddhist traveller? Fa-hsien was born in the Chinese city of Shansi sometime in the fourth century A.D. As a young man, Fa-hsien became an avid follower of Buddha. He resolved to visit India to see where the Buddha had lived his life and visit temples and shrines of Buddhist teaching. According to an account written by Fa-hsien titled Fo Kua Chi (Record of Buddhist Kingdoms), it took him more than five years to journey from China to central India. “In the desert were numerous evil spirits and scorching winds, causing death to anyone who would meet them,” he wrote. “Above there were no birds, while on the ground there were no animals. One looked as far as one could in all directions for a path to cross, but there was none to choose. Only the dried bones of the dead served as indications.” Fa-hsien wrote of mountains where he climbed sheer cliffs 8,000 feet tall.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ee994256-6eb6-47f8-895e-06bd595c5def>"]},{"passage":"Thus, by the mid-1980s, even foreigners with a limited knowledge of Chinese could, with the help of colleagues and translators, find out about China's long twentieth-century history of oral history, in much of its diversity and complexity. It seems, though, that this knowledge never entered a broader academic, let alone public, memory. This seeming reluctance to engage with pre-1980s oral history is even more perplexing when considering the article Zuo published in 2015. According to Zuo's article, which is based on Chinese publications and does not reference any English-language articles, oral history existed in China before the 1980s, but not in its \"modern form.\" Zuo writes: \"Modern oral history started in 1948 at Columbia University's Oral History Research Office.… Oral history in China was introduced from the West during the 1980s. Thus, the rise of oral history is a new trend in the development of historical studies in China. \"55 This is also the explanation Zheng Songhui, who described the development of oral history at Chinese libraries in 2008, provided.56 Li Huibo from China Women's University differentiates a first phase of oral history defined by state ideology from a \"second phase, the period beginning in the 1980s, when oral history was 'geared to international standards. '\"57 Her British collaborator on a women's oral history project, Margaretta Jolly, explained: \"Notably, these [standards] reflect not so much a movement away from the explicitly political approach of the earlier era as a complex mix of European Marxist and feminist [End Page 12] ideas of 'history from below,' which was partly disseminated through a visit by socialist British oral historian Paul Thompson in 1986. \"58 This is also what the CCOH staff told me. Considering Stave's and Kwong's articles, I found this assertion that oral history in China began only in the 1980s startling. Zuo argued that current Chinese oral history began only in the mid-1980s, even though oral historians, as he acknowledged, were aware of and informed by earlier research: \"Because of the long tradition of oral history in China and the practice of oral historical research as well as the oral interviews since 1949, Chinese scholars did not feel unfamiliar with the Western concept of oral history when it was introduced into China in the 1980s. The Western theory and method of oral history were smoothly accepted and quickly modified to integrate into the Chinese practice of the oral historical interview.… In 1986, Jing Shun published the first academic article to introduce to Chinese readers the theory and methods of oral history used in Europe and the United States. \"59 But Zuo did not explain what differentiated Chinese and Western oral history practices or what made the latter \"modern.\" Zuo argued that since the 1980s, oral history in China has developed along \"two basic tracks.\" One included historians using oral history in order to find out about the past; the other included a smaller group of oral historians exploring the theoretical underpinnings of oral history. \"Through the combined efforts of these two groups of scholars,\" he notes, \"oral history quickly took off as a new branch of the discipline of history in China. \"60 In Beijing, I met a few oral historians who had been conducting interviews since the 1980s. Ding Yizhuang, for example, interviewed Manchu women and old Beijingers in the 1990s and published several volumes of their narratives.61 Chen Mo has been interviewing Chinese filmmakers. Both later published books on oral history theory and method. Throughout the Oral History in China Conference they, like others, did not refer to any of the earlier work. Instead, they seemed to agree that oral history in China had begun only in the 1980s and that China now needed to catch up to the standards the West developed. Only Chu Hong-yuan from Taiwan called upon his colleagues not to focus exclusively on Western models but also to remember their own history—without referencing, however, any specific studies, projects, or scholars. As I have noted before, oral historians around the world often lack an awareness—let alone detailed knowledge—of their field's [End Page 13] history.62 I do not know enough about oral history in China to say whether such a paradox exists there, but it may be worth investigating, because it might have implications for the development of future studies.

Hilaly's account of the meeting showed Nixon asking President\nYahya to \"convey his feelings to the Chinese at the highest\nlevel\" that he believed that 1) \"Asia can not move forward\nif a nation as large as China remains isolated,\" and 2) the\nUnited States would not be \"party to any arrangements designed\nto isolate China.\" With this conversation, Nixon had taken\nthe first step toward opening a secret channel through Pakistan\nthat would later prove decisive. 3: Xiong Xianghui, \"The Prelude to the Opening of Sino-American\nRelations,\" Zhonggong dangshi ziliao [CCP History\nMaterials] No. 42 (June 1992), excerpts\nIn the early 1990s, Xiong Xianghui published the first historical\naccount, along with documents, of a special study group tasked\nby Chairman Mao in 1969 to review China's strategic policy. Xiong,\nformerly an aide to Zhou Enlai, had been the secretary to this\ngroup, which consisted of four marshals, senior military figures\nwho had been sent to inspect factories during the Cultural Revolution. The four marshals first focused on relations with Moscow just\nas the Sino-Soviet border clashes were breaking out; although\nthey saw the Soviets as dangerous, they doubted that Moscow intended\nto launch war against China. After Lin Biao gave a speech harshly\nattacking U.S. and Soviet imperialism, Mao asked the marshals\nto think outside the box about U.S. and Soviet policy. The four\nmarshals initially doubted that the Soviets and the Americans\nwould act against China either separately or jointly. When the\nborder fighting intensified in August 1969, marshals Chen Yi and\nYe Jianying worried about a confrontation with Moscow and proposed\nplaying the \"card of the United States.\" In a separate\nreport, Chen proposed high-level talks with the U.S. in order\nto solve basic problems in the relationship. The fourth line of\nthe third page reproduced here includes the text about playing\nthe American card.

Several months later, Snow met with Mao for five hours\nof talks on 18 December 1970 during which the Chairman said the\n[T]he foreign ministry was studying the matter of admitting\nAmericans from the left, middle, and right to visit China. Should\nrightists like Nixon, who represented the monopoly capitalists,\nbe permitted to come? He should be welcomed because, Mao explained\nat present the problems between China and the US would have\nto be solved with Nixon. Mao would be happy to talk with him,\neither as a tourist or as President. A week later, perhaps to reaffirm that something was afoot with\nSino-American relations, People's Daily published a picture\nof Mao and Snow from the National Day event. While the China expert\nAllen Whiting proposed going to Switzerland to debrief Snow about\nhis trip to China and meetings with the leadership, John Holdridge,\nthe China expert on Kissinger's staff, advised against that on\nthe grounds that Snow was a leftist.

Now, we wish that the youthful energy in the new Cabinet of the twin island nation infuses the entire Caribbean. This is indeed a gargantuan task but let us make a start with the agricultural sector. People are our most important resource and have to be fed. Agriculture is a science which guides farmers as they cultivate the soil for the growing of crops and the rearing of animals to provide food and other products for local and tourist consumption. Agricultural goods can be grown for export, to reduce the massive agricultural import bill and contribute to net foreign exchange earnings. Locally grown agricultural produce is more easily quality controlled and gets from farm to table in a much shorter time than imported produce. Many locally grown products reach the consumer at a cheaper price than imported products and selected products provide our full complement of nutrients. Why then do we not have a comprehensive coordinated programme for agricultural development in the Caribbean rather than a piecemeal approach by territory. This approach has not produced a sustainable solution in the last 70 years since the Report of West India Royal Commission, also known as The Moyne Report, was published at the end of the second world war. Many billions of dollars of national and donor funds have been wasted. Although not formally trained in agriculture science, I have been associated with the full spectrum of agriculturalists and the agricultural sector for my entire professional life and I am still involved in one way or another. Having been trained as a Mathematician, Statistician and Operations Research scientist in Jamaica, Wales and at the Imperial College of Science and Technology in London, I interned as a Biometrician at Rothamsted Research, formerly known as Rothamsted Experimental Station, which is the longest running agricultural research station in the world, providing cutting-edge science and innovation for nearly 170 years. The establishment of the Biometrics unit at the Faculty of Agriculture at University of the West Indies at St. Augustine Trinidad (1968) was my first professional assignment and it is still in operation today under the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute. I was President of the Caribbean Agro-Economic Society, the Barbados Society for Technologists in Agriculture and am currently Chairman of the recently launched Global Business Innovation Corporation which encapsulates the key components of the Caribbean Food Business Innovation Revolution. In addition, I was an avid vegetable gardener at least twice in my life, have been involved in many agricultural development consultancies and given advice to many post graduate agricultural students over the years. Eat Bajan Day this year is on October 9. This is managed by the Graham Gooding Trust of which I am a Trustee. Quite a lot has rubbed off from these experiences and if I do not know any specific detail in agriculture at least I know who to ask. My primary interest is in shepherding businesses to sustainable success. Agriculture is a business and my continuing interest in the sector is to contribute to its success at the enterprise, national and regional levels. I propose a simple 5M business system construct as follows: The Model (Idea\/innovation) is at the Core (Corporate Governance); The Money (outlay) provides the Stamina (Investment Finance); The Marketing (sales) is the Life (Marketing); The Methodology (shepherding) is the Growth (Operations); and the Mind-set Change (shepherding) inspires sustainability (People Development). The high inherent business risks in the agricultural sector are associated with the above five business systems. Corporate Governance risks – 3: (1) there is little or no focus on management meeting culture to structure the foundation of the business; (2) failure to observe legal and environmental laws reflecting society’s priorities or industry mandates; and (3) deleterious impact on the natural resource base. Investment Finance risks -2: (1) little or no focus on credit rating culture; and (2) low equity input by the entrepreneur in the business. Marketing risks – 4: (1) little or no focus on customer centric culture; (2) no proactive aggressive market led sales and distribution strategy; (3) unrealistic sales projections especially for start-ups, re-births, spin-offs and scale-ups; and (4) unpredictable prices and markets.\n\nPush and pull factors drive the decision to stay or move.

Consisting of over seven thousand islands, islets, reefs, and cays framed by the Gulf of Mexico, North, South, and Central America, the Caribbean is one of the most revered tropical tourist destinations in the world. The region is a biodiversity hotspot, with an extensive range of rich ecosystems; many of which are vulnerable to the manifestation of the effects of climate change and other anthropogenic occurrences. Continue reading “Sustainable Tourism in the Caribbean”\nOn 26 July 1953, approximately 160 young men stormed the Moncada barracks in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba in a revolt against then dictator Fulgencio Batista. The revolt, spearheaded by a 26-year-old lawyer, Fidel Castro, did not succeed at first. However, it marked the beginning of almost six years of revolution that eventually re-shaped the political structure of Cuba and also affected the greater Caribbean region. Alongside key figures such as Che Guevara, Raúl Castro, and Camilo Cienfuegos, Castro and his revolution succeeded in ousting Batista. After the Cuban Revolution, a new era dawned in Cuba. It saw the rise of Castro, becoming both a revered and reviled leader who stood firmly against the western capitalist system, principally embodied by the United States at the time. During the height of the Cold War, Castro also opted to form close ties with the Soviet Union. Cuba loses its revolutionary leader\nContinue reading “The Caribbean Community Honours Castro”\nIn the first of this three-part series dedicated to Calypso History Month, we learned that calypso is a genre of music which has played a very important role in the processes of confrontation, revolution, and revival in the Caribbean, as well as the invention and establishment of the Caribbean identity and heritage. Secondly, we saw that, overtime, women have risen from obscurity to become strong pillars in the development and internationalisation of calypso music, allowing for greater diversity and a more holistic view of Caribbean society. Now, we look at the fluidity of calypso and the effect time has had on this genre.

Darkness will always make way for the dawn, and just as mother nature defies logic and shoots fresh grass from beneath concrete, the human spirit endures. Drawing on these principles, we observe the most famous musical genre coming out of the Caribbean – Calypso. The diversity of the music in the region is hinged on the influence of our enslaved ancestors as well as the external forces that impressed upon the society over time. Music plays a significant role in the construct of cultural identity. As one of the most complex forms of human cultural expressions, music epitomises a culture’s most fundamental values.\n\nIssues in Anthropology: Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean\nFrom Wikibooks, open books for an open world\nTable of Contents\nSection One: The cultural legacies of political leaders\n- Fidel Castro and his impact on US-Cuban relations\n- Che Guevara and the 26th of July Movement: An analysis of his legacy in relation to American Imperialism\n- The formation of the Nicaraguan Revolution, from Augusto Sandino to the newly re-elected Daniel Ortega: gender, land reform, military, and education.

None of these men had any experience or expertise in tropical agriculture, although Moton was ‘now taking courses’ in that field. There is evidence that Jones was not aware how different farming in the tropics was from farming in the U.S. There are several accounts of agronomists’ frustration with Jones’ lack of understanding of these differences. Jones insisted that beans brought over from the U.S. should grow, but that did not make them grow. Similarly, most of the pigs they tried to raise died, perhaps because they were not the right sort of pigs for the tropics. Perhaps they would have done better with a pig-like species native to Amazonia, such as the peccary. The pioneers could surely have benefited from more expert advice. And the advice was there for the taking, from such places as the College of Tropical Agriculture at the University of Hawaii and – closer to Guyana – St. Augustine in the Caribbean island nation of Trinidad. Was the only reason Jonestown made no attempt to involve experts from either of these institutions due to the fact that they were not members of Peoples Temple? Judging by the discussions recorded in Edith Roller’s journal, agriculture at Jonestown was still in deep trouble in 1978. New sows had been acquired, but more and more of their piglets were dying. The cows were giving too little milk. Had they bought the wrong kind of cows? Had they been swindled? Some vegetables were doing well, others were not. Books about tropical agriculture had been ordered and were arriving, and Jones urged a big effort to study them. But still, many things were going wrong, and no one seemed to know why. Coupled with Jones’ lack of knowledge and experience was his increasing paranoia that the CIA was conspiring against them. The agency’s experiments with weather modification were altering amounts of rainfall in the Northwest District, he claimed, and their saboteurs had infiltrated into Jonestown, secretly injecting poison into the eggs. Certain crops did thrive at Jonestown – eddoes, sweet potatoes, and especially cassava – but unfortunately, these were foods very low in vitamins and minerals. Too rapid a growth in the population of the settlement\nDuring the early years (1974-77), the three dozen or so Jonestown pioneers seem to have been making modest progress. According to a progress report issued in the summer of 1977, their expectation was that the settlement would pass through a third ‘intermediate’ stage, lasting one year and bringing the population up to between 70 and 100. Then a fourth ‘substantial’ stage lasting two years would allow the population to grow to about 500 by 1980. However, it appears that they did not anticipate that the settlement was ever going to accommodate more than about 500 people. Then suddenly, in August 1977, in response to the imminent publication of a critical exposé of Peoples Temple in New West magazine, Jones made an on-the-spot decision to leave the United States for Guyana and move as many members of Peoples Temple to Jonestown as he could as quickly as possible. In the course of a year, 1000 Temple members emigrated in Guyana, almost all of whom lived in Jonestown. Moreover, a large proportion of the new arrivals were either too young or too old to work. This unanticipated rapid influx of new arrivals led inevitably to a sharp fall in the standard of living. Overcrowding was exacerbated. The quality of food deteriorated, with increased reliance on imported rice. Administration must have become much less effective: the new situation changed the demands placed on it, making previous planning less relevant. The arrival of Jones, with his delusions and his inconsistent and idiosyncratic managerial style, must have had a strong disorganizing effect. Setting too short a period for achieving self-sufficiency\nIn the summer of 1977, the pioneers estimated that Jonestown would need at least another three and possibly five years to achieve economic self-sufficiency.\n\nPosted by CM on Monday, January 28, 2008 at 6:47am. 1.

The abolitionists played a very vital role in the abolition of the slave trade and the abolition of slavery itself. The movement to end slavery began in 1823 with the formation of the Society for Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery and the efforts continued with the Agency Committee formed in 1831.There were other mitigating circumstances which also favored the abolitionists such as the Reform Act, the economic decline of West India sugar, social unrest of the slaves and the Industrial revolution. All these factors contributed to the gradual ending of slavery in the British West Indies. They were also aware of the huge commercial and economic power of the Caribbean planter interest. By the 1820’s it was obvious that slavery was still well established in the Caribbean. Facing this reality, the old members of the abolitionist society met in 1823 and formed the London Society for Mitigating and Gradually Abolition of Slavery. Thomas Clarkson, a member travelled ten thousand miles trying to get support and to encourage the formation of local organizations. His efforts resulted in the formation of two hundred and thirty local organizations. The main strategy was the preparation of petitions and by 1824 seven hundred and seventy seven petitions was sent to Parliament calling for the total abolition of slavery. Parliament’s response was limited choosing to focus on the improvement of the slaves’ lives by setting forth the Amelioration proposals.

We are painfully aware of the tremendous loss to the agricultural sector and indeed to Dominica as a whole as a result of the passing of this distinguished and very accomplished agricultural officer. His outstanding and immense contribution to agriculture development in Dominica , the Windward Islands and the Caribbean region is well acknowledged. Many officers from the Ministry of Agriculture in Grenada have met and have interacted with Mr. Allport over the years in countless meetings, workshops, training sessions etc. and they are all unanimously in agreement that he has always stood out as a vivacious, high energetic, exceptionally knowledgeable and keen contributor to every discussion that he has been involved in. He would undoubtedly be greatly missed by the entire farming fraternity in the region. On behalf of the Honourable Minister of Agriculture, Honourable Denis Michael Lett, Permanent Secretary, Mr. Aaron Francois, senior members of staff of the Ministry of Agriculture and other staff, farmers and other key stakeholders of the farming fraternity in Grenada, I would like to express our deepest and most profound sympathy to the entire staff of the Ministry of Agriculture, Dominica, his wife Mrs. Ruth Allport and children and all members of the agriculture community in the Nature Isle.

Now, we wish that the youthful energy in the new Cabinet of the twin island nation infuses the entire Caribbean. This is indeed a gargantuan task but let us make a start with the agricultural sector. People are our most important resource and have to be fed. Agriculture is a science which guides farmers as they cultivate the soil for the growing of crops and the rearing of animals to provide food and other products for local and tourist consumption. Agricultural goods can be grown for export, to reduce the massive agricultural import bill and contribute to net foreign exchange earnings. Locally grown agricultural produce is more easily quality controlled and gets from farm to table in a much shorter time than imported produce. Many locally grown products reach the consumer at a cheaper price than imported products and selected products provide our full complement of nutrients. Why then do we not have a comprehensive coordinated programme for agricultural development in the Caribbean rather than a piecemeal approach by territory. This approach has not produced a sustainable solution in the last 70 years since the Report of West India Royal Commission, also known as The Moyne Report, was published at the end of the second world war. Many billions of dollars of national and donor funds have been wasted. Although not formally trained in agriculture science, I have been associated with the full spectrum of agriculturalists and the agricultural sector for my entire professional life and I am still involved in one way or another. Having been trained as a Mathematician, Statistician and Operations Research scientist in Jamaica, Wales and at the Imperial College of Science and Technology in London, I interned as a Biometrician at Rothamsted Research, formerly known as Rothamsted Experimental Station, which is the longest running agricultural research station in the world, providing cutting-edge science and innovation for nearly 170 years. The establishment of the Biometrics unit at the Faculty of Agriculture at University of the West Indies at St. Augustine Trinidad (1968) was my first professional assignment and it is still in operation today under the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute. I was President of the Caribbean Agro-Economic Society, the Barbados Society for Technologists in Agriculture and am currently Chairman of the recently launched Global Business Innovation Corporation which encapsulates the key components of the Caribbean Food Business Innovation Revolution. In addition, I was an avid vegetable gardener at least twice in my life, have been involved in many agricultural development consultancies and given advice to many post graduate agricultural students over the years. Eat Bajan Day this year is on October 9. This is managed by the Graham Gooding Trust of which I am a Trustee. Quite a lot has rubbed off from these experiences and if I do not know any specific detail in agriculture at least I know who to ask. My primary interest is in shepherding businesses to sustainable success. Agriculture is a business and my continuing interest in the sector is to contribute to its success at the enterprise, national and regional levels. I propose a simple 5M business system construct as follows: The Model (Idea\/innovation) is at the Core (Corporate Governance); The Money (outlay) provides the Stamina (Investment Finance); The Marketing (sales) is the Life (Marketing); The Methodology (shepherding) is the Growth (Operations); and the Mind-set Change (shepherding) inspires sustainability (People Development). The high inherent business risks in the agricultural sector are associated with the above five business systems. Corporate Governance risks – 3: (1) there is little or no focus on management meeting culture to structure the foundation of the business; (2) failure to observe legal and environmental laws reflecting society’s priorities or industry mandates; and (3) deleterious impact on the natural resource base. Investment Finance risks -2: (1) little or no focus on credit rating culture; and (2) low equity input by the entrepreneur in the business. Marketing risks – 4: (1) little or no focus on customer centric culture; (2) no proactive aggressive market led sales and distribution strategy; (3) unrealistic sales projections especially for start-ups, re-births, spin-offs and scale-ups; and (4) unpredictable prices and markets.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:33fc80d5-dcdd-4ff6-97d5-2e47fb4103af>"]},{"passage":"Push and pull factors drive the decision to stay or move.

The region is a biodiversity hotspot, with an extensive range of rich ecosystems; many of which are vulnerable to the manifestation of the effects of climate change and other anthropogenic occurrences. Continue reading “Sustainable Tourism in the Caribbean”\nOn 26 July 1953, approximately 160 young men stormed the Moncada barracks in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba in a revolt against then dictator Fulgencio Batista. The revolt, spearheaded by a 26-year-old lawyer, Fidel Castro, did not succeed at first. However, it marked the beginning of almost six years of revolution that eventually re-shaped the political structure of Cuba and also affected the greater Caribbean region. Alongside key figures such as Che Guevara, Raúl Castro, and Camilo Cienfuegos, Castro and his revolution succeeded in ousting Batista. After the Cuban Revolution, a new era dawned in Cuba. It saw the rise of Castro, becoming both a revered and reviled leader who stood firmly against the western capitalist system, principally embodied by the United States at the time. During the height of the Cold War, Castro also opted to form close ties with the Soviet Union.

Music plays a significant role in the construct of cultural identity.

None of these men had any experience or expertise in tropical agriculture, although Moton was ‘now taking courses’ in that field. There is evidence that Jones was not aware how different farming in the tropics was from farming in the U.S. There are several accounts of agronomists’ frustration with Jones’ lack of understanding of these differences. Jones insisted that beans brought over from the U.S. should grow, but that did not make them grow. Similarly, most of the pigs they tried to raise died, perhaps because they were not the right sort of pigs for the tropics. Perhaps they would have done better with a pig-like species native to Amazonia, such as the peccary. The pioneers could surely have benefited from more expert advice. And the advice was there for the taking, from such places as the College of Tropical Agriculture at the University of Hawaii and – closer to Guyana – St. Augustine in the Caribbean island nation of Trinidad. Was the only reason Jonestown made no attempt to involve experts from either of these institutions due to the fact that they were not members of Peoples Temple? Judging by the discussions recorded in Edith Roller’s journal, agriculture at Jonestown was still in deep trouble in 1978. New sows had been acquired, but more and more of their piglets were dying. The cows were giving too little milk. Had they bought the wrong kind of cows? Had they been swindled? Some vegetables were doing well, others were not. Books about tropical agriculture had been ordered and were arriving, and Jones urged a big effort to study them. But still, many things were going wrong, and no one seemed to know why. Coupled with Jones’ lack of knowledge and experience was his increasing paranoia that the CIA was conspiring against them. The agency’s experiments with weather modification were altering amounts of rainfall in the Northwest District, he claimed, and their saboteurs had infiltrated into Jonestown, secretly injecting poison into the eggs. Certain crops did thrive at Jonestown – eddoes, sweet potatoes, and especially cassava – but unfortunately, these were foods very low in vitamins and minerals. Too rapid a growth in the population of the settlement\nDuring the early years (1974-77), the three dozen or so Jonestown pioneers seem to have been making modest progress. According to a progress report issued in the summer of 1977, their expectation was that the settlement would pass through a third ‘intermediate’ stage, lasting one year and bringing the population up to between 70 and 100. Then a fourth ‘substantial’ stage lasting two years would allow the population to grow to about 500 by 1980. However, it appears that they did not anticipate that the settlement was ever going to accommodate more than about 500 people. Then suddenly, in August 1977, in response to the imminent publication of a critical exposé of Peoples Temple in New West magazine, Jones made an on-the-spot decision to leave the United States for Guyana and move as many members of Peoples Temple to Jonestown as he could as quickly as possible. In the course of a year, 1000 Temple members emigrated in Guyana, almost all of whom lived in Jonestown. Moreover, a large proportion of the new arrivals were either too young or too old to work. This unanticipated rapid influx of new arrivals led inevitably to a sharp fall in the standard of living. Overcrowding was exacerbated. The quality of food deteriorated, with increased reliance on imported rice. Administration must have become much less effective: the new situation changed the demands placed on it, making previous planning less relevant. The arrival of Jones, with his delusions and his inconsistent and idiosyncratic managerial style, must have had a strong disorganizing effect. Setting too short a period for achieving self-sufficiency\nIn the summer of 1977, the pioneers estimated that Jonestown would need at least another three and possibly five years to achieve economic self-sufficiency.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:9177aa26-e180-4e09-8aa5-2d97bd5dc507>"]},{"passage":"Posted by CM on Monday, January 28, 2008 at 6:47am. 1.

The abolitionists played a very vital role in the abolition of the slave trade and the abolition of slavery itself. The movement to end slavery began in 1823 with the formation of the Society for Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery and the efforts continued with the Agency Committee formed in 1831.There were other mitigating circumstances which also favored the abolitionists such as the Reform Act, the economic decline of West India sugar, social unrest of the slaves and the Industrial revolution. All these factors contributed to the gradual ending of slavery in the British West Indies. They were also aware of the huge commercial and economic power of the Caribbean planter interest. By the 1820’s it was obvious that slavery was still well established in the Caribbean. Facing this reality, the old members of the abolitionist society met in 1823 and formed the London Society for Mitigating and Gradually Abolition of Slavery. Thomas Clarkson, a member travelled ten thousand miles trying to get support and to encourage the formation of local organizations. His efforts resulted in the formation of two hundred and thirty local organizations. The main strategy was the preparation of petitions and by 1824 seven hundred and seventy seven petitions was sent to Parliament calling for the total abolition of slavery. Parliament’s response was limited choosing to focus on the improvement of the slaves’ lives by setting forth the Amelioration proposals. The responsibility for implementing the proposals was given to the colonial assemblies but little or nothing was actually done. Many Christians complained of being abused by the plantocracy and the continuous bad treatment of the slaves. The slaves believed that the Amelioration Proposals meant freedom and this rumor caused an uproar amongst the slaves who wanted to take action against the planters for withholding their...

Investors rushed to sell, but there were no buyers, many lost everything. The Great Depression: (How long did it last?) 12 years Other than the stock market what contributed to the Great Depression:\nOverproduction –supply was greater than demand. banking crisis –Companies couldn’t repay loans so banks were in crisis. agricultural recession) – farmers had overproduced – no one to buy their crops; could repay loans – lost their farms; drought\/Dust Bowl\nBankruptcy: (What is it? How does it relate to the Great Depression?) - financial failure caused by a company’s inability to pay its debts. Caused more layoffs. How did the Great Depression affect other countries? Spread worldwide. European nations owned U.S. huge amounts of money they couldn’t repay. – they defaulted or failed to repay their loans. = slowdown in international trade. Unemployment: (What percentage of America was unemployed? How many people was this?) Unemployment went from 3% to 25% = 1.3 million people President Hoover: (Who did he think should be responsible for relief? He thought business leaders and local governments should step in – not federal government\nEncouraged businesses and states to start public works projects; urged private charities to set up soup kitchens. What were some of the things he did? -Formed the Reconstruction Finance Corporation: to fund critical businesses such as banks, insurance companies and railroads; gave money to local govts for public works projects. What transpired with the Bonus Army?) - Bonus Army: veterans of WWI were supposed to be paid a bonus (extra payment) in 1945. They wanted it early so they marched on Washington DC; government forces used tear gas, tanks, and guns to move them. At least one veteran died, 100 injured. Americans were outraged.

Bipolar affects approximately 2.6% of the adult population in the United States. Although bipolar symptoms can emerge at any time, the typical age of onset is between 18 and 25. Bipolar affects men and women equally. There are some factors that increase the risk of bipolar including: The manic phase may last one week or more and is characterized by increased energy and an elevated or irritable mood that is present for most of the day. Diagnosis requires the presence of three or more of these symptoms: Symptoms of hypomanic episodes are similar, but tend to be shorter in duration, lasting four days or more. Psychotic symptoms are not present during hypomanic episodes, and the symptoms are not so severe as to require hospitalization. Hypomanic symptoms are common among all the bipolar diagnoses, but manic episodes are symptomatic solely of bipolar I. The depressive phase of bipolar includes at least five symptoms of major depression that last for at least two weeks, including: While bipolar cannot be cured, it can be managed effectively. Psychotherapy can help people with bipolar by teaching them how to recognize triggers so they can understand or possibly avoid them, decrease negatively expressed emotions, and practice healthy coping skills. Finding a therapist or counselor with whom you can establish a healthy therapeutic relationship may help develop some of the following skills for managing bipolar: Some types of psychotherapy such as family-focused and dialectable therapies are effective in preventing relapses. Although the research clearly demonstrates that bipolar often has an organic ideology, psychotherapy has been proven to be an effective treatment. Medication is also commonly used in the treatment of bipolar. Another myth about bipolar is that it is only caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. While there is an organic component to it, bipolar is typically influenced by a variety of factors including environment and experience. Finally, it is a myth that people with bipolar cannot lead a normal life. Bipolar can be effectively managed with treatment, and many people with bipolar experience long periods of remission.

A colleague of mine in the US heard that her grandson had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital. As a long-standing critic of the psychiatric system she was concerned for his welfare and went to see him. She discovered that in the first few days he had been drugged into a stupor and she insisted on seeing the medical staff. Three psychiatrists told her that, sadly, her grandson had a bipolar disorder caused by a brain bio-chemical imbalance. Quietly, but firmly, she asked what evidence they had there was something wrong with his brain. They said that his mood and behaviour indicated a serious problem. She asked how they knew this problem was caused by brain biochemistry. Slightly uncomfortable, they vaguely referred to studies that indicated that this was the case. Much more confident now, my colleague responded that she knew of no studies that had ever confirmed this idea even though it is a common assumption in the psychiatric world. For good measure she quoted some studies that indicated that there was nothing wrong with the brains of people with all sorts of psychiatric labels. Sensing that they were dealing with someone who might actually have read the literature they asked what she wanted. Her grandson was quickly transferred to a unit offering talking therapies. My colleague didn’t ask the question that all patients, relatives and advocates should ask when confronted with the claim that a brain biochemical problem lies at the root of someone’s low mood or strange behaviour. She could have said, \"Can I see the test results, please?\" The truth is that, unlike all other branches of medicine, psychiatrists do not do physical tests on people to confirm their diagnoses. The reason is simple: there is nothing wrong with the brains of people diagnosed schizophrenic, bi-polar, depressed and so on. The organic hypothesis remains just that; an unproven hypothesis. Claims continue to be made in the scientific literature and popular press. David Cohen, another US activist, has noted that almost all the substances operating within the human body have been investigated as a possible cause of schizophrenia. This research is leaked to the press before it has been accepted in a peer-reviewed journal and \"the results are likely to be cited around the world, thought they may never make it to scientific publication\". We are also well aware of the massive conflicts of interest involved in the studies that do finally appear in the official literature. Effective Health Care, in reviewing the newest so-called anti-psychotic medication concluded, \"Most relevant trials are undertaken by those with clear pecuniary interest in the results\"1. There is no validity in psychiatric diagnosis2,3. Even if there were, after almost two hundred years, we have never found anything at all wrong with the brain biochemistry of people diagnosed with a host of so-called disorders. Some, conditions, for example, Alcohol-induced dementia do indeed show real signs of brain damage. This is rare. The studies on all the main diagnostic categories of psychiatry, however, are plagued by a significant problem: the people being tested have almost always already received psychotropic medication. In other words, if there is a blood, brain or liver disorder, this may well have been caused by the drugs, or ECT. Physical tests on people diagnosed, but not yet treated, by psychiatrists, would be the only way to find out if there really were a difference between these people and the general public. This never happens as most people first encounter a GP who, instead of asking for blood and other tests to demonstrate a psychiatric condition, simply prescribe a psychotropic drug or refer on to a psychiatrist. Imagine the same situation in oncology. You are told that you look like you have cancer. There are no tests offered to you. You are told you will have two operations, followed by radiotherapy and a course of drugs that makes your hair fall out. The idea is preposterous. You demand proof of your condition. An x-ray, a CT scan and blood and liver tests reveal that the diagnosis was accurate. Reassured, though still very scared you agree to the treatment. Psychiatrists of course do ask for tests like CT scans on their patients but these are to exclude the possibility of organic damage. In other words, they are checking to see if there is a real brain problem, evidence of illegal drug-use or whatever.\n\nHave you ever stopped to think about how the mental health stigma doesn’t make sense? So many of us walk around feeling ashamed of our struggles, trying to hide them from the rest of the world. Yet functioning with these immense internal difficulties actually evinces our strength! As actress Carrie Fisher wrote in Wishful Drinking:\n“Being bipolar can be an all-consuming challenge, requiring a lot of stamina and even more courage, so if you’re living with this illness and functioning at all, it’s something to be proud of, not ashamed of.”\nPlus, try this statistic on for size: according to the CDC, nearly 50% of U.S. adults will struggle with at least one mental illness in their lifetime. In this post, we’ll focus on the dual diagnosis of addiction and bipolar disorder. What Is Bipolar Disorder? Bipolar is a mood disorder characterized by emotional swings from high to low. People with bipolar deal with depressive “down” phases and manic “up” phases, and they struggle to find a healthy middle ground. In a depressive state, a person might be immobilized, unable to take care of their usual responsibilities. But in a manic state, that same person might work around the clock. One quick definition for bipolar is “experiencing extremes”. This disorder does have a genetic component, but an individual’s environment matters a great deal as well. Growing up in a physically, mentally, or emotionally traumatic environment is a strong risk factor. Why an Accurate Diagnosis Can Be Difficult\nHere are a few key reasons why bipolar disorder can be difficult to diagnose accurately:\nFirst, if a person is under the influence, it’s extremely challenging to provide an accurate diagnosis. Having people detox prior to diagnosis is ideal. Next, the bipolar label has increased in popularity in recent years. This is great for awareness, but it can also lead to misdiagnosis. For example, sometimes people who are dealing with clinical depression are misdiagnosed with bipolar because of the dramatic difference between their low-functioning depressive state and their usual functioning state. Similarly, rigid, black-and-white thinking can be confused with bipolar symptoms, and so can the aftereffects of trauma. Finally, when people have a great deal of conflict in their lives, they may be labeled as bipolar. But when they gain the tools they need to resolve those conflicts, often the level of internal tension changes significantly. In short, understanding bipolar disorder and addiction is critical for accurate diagnosis and treatment. True bipolar disorder involves an imbalance in brain chemistry, and it’s certainly a serious condition. Yet in our experience in running a residential addiction treatment center, we see people misdiagnosed as bipolar when in reality they have mental and emotional issues causing a lot of upset in their lives. That’s not brain chemistry; that’s just upset. We find that when such people heal those issues, the upset in their lives decreases dramatically. The Connection Between Addiction and Bipolar Disorder\nBipolar disorder is part of a family of mood disorders, including depression, anxiety, and seasonal affective disorder (SAD). While mood disorders can be caused or exacerbated by drug use, more often people with mood disorders use addictive substances to self-medicate. Many people with bipolar turn to substances during their depressive states. There is a particularly strong connection between bipolar and addiction. Statistics from DualDiagnosis.org suggest that 56% of people with bipolar disorder have experienced drug addiction. Healing from Bipolar and Addiction\nSeptember is National Recovery Month, and it’s also Self Awareness Month. This is fitting, as you can’t really have one without the other. Self awareness is an essential component of recovery, especially when you’re dealing with a dual diagnosis. That said, medication certainly has its place as well. If you find that you continue to struggle with emotional extremes after you’ve detoxed from substances, then medication may give you the support you need to maintain emotional stability. However, don’t shortchange yourself by skipping over the mental and emotional issues that contribute to mood disorders. Finding and addressing the root causes of physical disorders can minimize (or eliminate!) the need for medications to treat symptoms, and the same is true for emotional disorders. What Counseling Strategies Work Well with Bipolar?\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two genes that influence the activity of nerve cells in the brain may play a key role in a person's risk for bipolar disorder, marked by dramatic swings from depression to manic behavior, researchers said on Sunday. The findings are not expected to lead to a genetic test for the risk of the condition but could help unravel the mystery of how it arises and lead to better treatments, they reported in the journal Nature Genetics. An international team of scientists examined the genomes of 10,596 people mainly from Britain and the United States, including 4,387 with bipolar disorder, also sometimes known as manic-depression. The researchers found those with bipolar disorder more likely to have certain variants of the ANK3 and CACNA1C genes. Proteins made by the two genes help govern the flow of sodium and calcium ions into and out of neurons in the brain, influencing the activity of these nerve cells. \"The key importance of this is that it gives us a clear idea of the sorts of chemicals and mechanisms in the brain that are involved in bipolar disorder,\" Nick Craddock of Britain's Cardiff University, who helped lead the study, said in a telephone interview. \"Over a number of years, that will help researchers to develop better approaches to diagnosis and treatment.\" Because it tends to run in families, scientists have been trying to pinpoint genes involved in bipolar disorder. This was the largest genetic analysis of its kind on the disease, which affects an estimated 1 percent to 3 percent of adults worldwide, Craddock said. The brain disorder causes extreme shifts in mood, energy and ability to function. It is marked by high periods of elation or irritability and low periods of sadness and hopelessness that can last months. The proper function of brain neurons depends on a delicate equilibrium between sodium and calcium, the researchers said. \"The brain operates according to how quickly calcium and sodium are going in and out of cells and how much of it goes in and out,\" Craddock said. The findings suggest that bipolar disorder may stem at least in part from malfunctions in the flow of these ions, which are electrically charged versions of the chemicals. There is a need for better treatment, Craddock said. Lithium, the most common, helps only about two-thirds of those with the disorder and can cause drowsiness, weight gain and mild shakiness. The U.S. government's National Institutes of Health helped fund the research. Dr. Thomas Insel, director of the NIH's National Institute of Mental Health, said the findings may help solve the puzzle that is bipolar disorder. \"It's not going to tell us the whole story -- it doesn't give you the whole puzzle -- but it's something to build on,\" Insel said in a telephone interview. Craddock said identifying the two gene variants probably will not be helpful in determining an individual's risk for the disorder because many who do not have the disease will have the genes.\n\nBipolar disorder is one of the most difficult mental illnesses to diagnose and treat because of its complicated shifts between different symptoms. At the present time there is no cure for bipolar disorder but strategies such as medication and cognitive behavioral therapy to help minimize symptoms and manage the illness. However some researchers are looking for different methods that could use a more holistic approach to treating the disorder in the future. Mental illness often are closely related to issues in the brain that lead to certain mood problems and various behaviors. Medications are meant to help balance out chemicals in the brain that may be causing certain symptoms. However, researchers believe that helping to restore nerve cell health in the brain for better communication may go a long way to treat issues like bipolar disorder. In the past it was believed that bipolar disorder was caused by an imbalance of chemicals like serotonin or dopamine which led to depressed or elevated moods. Researchers now believe that neural plasticity may play a more important role in alleviated the symptoms of mania and depression. People with bipolar disorder tend to have atrophy of neurons in certain brain areas but improving nerve cells in these areas could potentially change the path of the disorder. Medications like lithium which are used in treating bipolar disorder were recently discovered to actually boost levels of proteins that help neurons maintain their function. This may explain why lithium has been shown to be effective as a long term treatment. Using other methods to improve the health of neurons in the brain may create a more focused and efficient way to reduce symptoms quickly. Although more research needs to be done to determine long term results, nerve and brain health may be the focus of bipolar treatment in the future.\n\nBipolar Disorder (cont.) In this Article\nWhat are the risk factors for bipolar disorder? Scientists are learning about the possible causes of bipolar disorder. Most scientists agree that there is no single cause. Rather, many factors likely act together to produce the illness or increase risk. Bipolar disorder tends to run in families, so researchers are looking for genes that may increase a person's chance of developing the illness. Genes are the \"building blocks\" of heredity. They help control how the body and brain work and grow. Genes are contained inside a person's cells that are passed down from parents to children. Children with a parent or sibling who has bipolar disorder are four to six times more likely to develop the illness, compared with children who do not have a family history of bipolar disorder. However, most children with a family history of bipolar disorder will not develop the illness. Genetic research on bipolar disorder is being helped by advances in technology. This type of research is now much quicker and more far-reaching than in the past. One example is the launch of the Bipolar Disorder Phenome Database, funded in part by NIMH. Using the database, scientists will be able to link visible signs of the disorder with the genes that may influence them. So far, researchers using this database found that most people with bipolar disorder had:\nThe researchers also identified certain traits that appeared to run in families, including:\nScientists continue to study these traits, which may help them find the genes that cause bipolar disorder some day. But genes are not the only risk factor for bipolar disorder. Studies of identical twins have shown that the twin of a person with bipolar illness does not always develop the disorder. This is important because identical twins share all of the same genes. The study results suggest factors besides genes are also at work. Rather, it is likely that many different genes and a person's environment are involved. However, scientists do not yet fully understand how these factors interact to cause bipolar disorder. Brain structure and functioning\nBrain-imaging studies are helping scientists learn what happens in the brain of a person with bipolar disorder. Newer brain-imaging tools, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), allow researchers to take pictures of the living brain at work. These tools help scientists study the brain's structure and activity. Some imaging studies show how the brains of people with bipolar disorder may differ from the brains of healthy people or people with other mental disorders. For example, one study using MRI found that the pattern of brain development in children with bipolar disorder was similar to that in children with \"multi-dimensional impairment,\" a disorder that causes symptoms that overlap somewhat with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. This suggests that the common pattern of brain development may be linked to general risk for unstable moods. Learning more about these differences, along with information gained from genetic studies, helps scientists better understand bipolar disorder. Someday scientists may be able to predict which types of treatment will work most effectively. They may even find ways to prevent bipolar disorder. How is bipolar disorder diagnosed? The first step in getting a proper diagnosis is to talk to a doctor, who may conduct a physical examination, an interview, and lab tests. Bipolar disorder cannot currently be identified through a blood test or a brain scan, but these tests can help rule out other contributing factors, such as a stroke or brain tumor. If the problems are not caused by other illnesses, the doctor may conduct a mental health evaluation. The doctor may also provide a referral to a trained mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist, who is experienced in diagnosing and treating bipolar disorder. The doctor or mental health professional should conduct a complete diagnostic evaluation. He or she should discuss any family history of bipolar disorder or other mental illnesses and get a complete history of symptoms. The doctor or mental health professionals should also talk to the person's close relatives or spouse and note how they describe the person's symptoms and family medical history. People with bipolar disorder are more likely to seek help when they are depressed than when experiencing mania or hypomania. Therefore, a careful medical history is needed to assure that bipolar disorder is not mistakenly diagnosed as major depressive disorder, which is also called unipolar depression.\n\n2.8 percent of U.S adults live with bipolar disorder. Some of them have episodes several times a year; others experience them rarely. Attacks may last for days or weeks. Unfortunately, this condition has no cure. A common misconception is that this disorder is just about having mood swings. The truth is, it is a severe mental condition that can affect one’s quality of life. There is plenty to know about bipolar disorder, including available treatment options that help manage the bipolar disorder symptoms. What Is Bipolar Disorder? Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, and concentration. Everyone has ups and downs, but with bipolar disorder, these changes are severe. The changes range from episodes of extreme highs called mania to extreme lows called depression. Unlike ordinary mood swings, the mood changes of bipolar disorder are so intense that they may interfere with relationships, productivity at work, and daily activities. What Are the Causes and Triggers of Bipolar Disorder? There is no apparent cause of disorder bipolar. It results from a combination of genetic and environmental causes. Certain factors may trigger episodes in people who are predisposed to the condition. Is bipolar disorder hereditary? Yes, it is. You are more likely to develop this condition if someone in your immediate family has it. The risk is higher if either your parents or your twin has the disease. It is clear that more than one gene is involved. Researchers are yet to determine the particular genes responsible for the disorder. However, not everyone with an inherited vulnerability develops the disease. Therefore, genes are not the only cause. Abnormalities in Brain Structure and Functioning\nSome studies indicate that the brain structure and functioning of people with bipolar disorder are different from that of people who have no mental illnesses. However, there is not enough information about these differences to inform diagnosis. Therefore, health care providers base their diagnosis on a patient’s symptoms and history rather than brain imaging. Research indicates that external factors can trigger episodes of mania or depression. Environmental influences may also make existing symptoms worse. Some of the most common environmental triggers are:\nStressful life events can trigger the disorder in someone with a genetic vulnerability. Such events involve drastic changes such as losing a loved one, going away to college, losing a job, or moving. Positive life events such as getting married can also trigger an episode. Substance abuse alone cannot cause bipolar disorder. However, it can trigger an episode or worsen the progression of symptoms. Drugs such as cocaine, amphetamines, or ecstasy can trigger mania. Alcohol can trigger depression. Manic episodes are expected during the summer. Depressive episodes are typical during fall, winter, and spring. Not getting enough sleep can trigger a manic episode. The quality of sleep is also essential. Restless nights can worsen symptoms and make extreme behavior more likely. What Are the Different Types of Bipolar Disorder? According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM), there are three main types of bipolar disorder based on the nature and severity of symptoms. It is the classic form of this disorder and was originally referred to as “manic depression.” One may experience a sudden, extreme shift in moods, and their behavior may escalate quickly. Individuals with this type of bipolar disorder experience episodes of severe mania. A diagnosis of bipolar I mean that you have experienced at least one manic episode that lasts longer than one week. 90% of people with this disorder also experience periods of depression. Without treatment, manic episodes last 3-6 months, and depressive episodes last 6-12 months. Individuals with this type of disorder experience a less severe form of mania called hypomania. A diagnosis of bipolar II means you often experience major depressive episode. Instead of mania, you experience a less extreme episode called hypomania. Hypomania often becomes worse without treatment and may result in severe mania or depression. Individuals with this type of disorder have symptoms that do not meet the diagnostic requirements for hypomania or depression. They experience mild symptoms that last for 1-2 years. What Are Signs and Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder? Bipolar disorder is typically diagnosed in late adolescence or early adulthood. Symptoms can appear in children, pregnant women, or after childbirth. A manic episode does not always turn someone into a maniac. In this state, a person may feel extreme highs and engage in risky .\n\nBipolar disorder usually begins in early adulthood, between eighteen and thirty years of age. The earlier symptoms appear, the more severe the illness tends to be. Bipolar disorder typically begins after a stressful life event, such as the death of a loved one, a divorce, or financial problems. Sometimes an illness, such as a physical injury or stroke, can trigger symptoms. Most people with bipolar disorder have at least one episode of depression, along with one or more episodes of mania. It’s important to seek treatment for bipolar disorder if you or someone you know has symptoms..\nWhat is the main cause of bipolar disorder? Bipolar disorder is a brain disorder that causes extreme shifts in mood, energy, and activity levels. It occurs in 1-2% of the general population. There is strong evidence that genes play a role in causing depression and bipolar disorder. Many genes are involved in how the brain works. Studies show that an abnormality in the genes that control the brain chemical serotonin may be responsible for bipolar disorder in many patients..\nWhy are females so bipolar? There are several reasons behind this question. Some of the factors include nature and nurture. Females have biologically programmed mood swings. This is because they have to carry the baby for nine months and therefore are more sensitive. Males, on the other hand, are more on the aggressive side. This is also because of the different hormones present in the brain. Again, nurture is an important factor. Society disapprove of men showing their emotions and so, through a series of upbringing, boys are made to hide their feelings. When the society encourages the opposite in girls, the difference in behavior is natural..\nWhat are the signs of bipolar in a woman? Hi , A woman who is suffering from bipolar disorder may show some of the following signs. -She may be in high spirits one moment and then her mood could suddenly change to being depressed. -She may not be able to sleep properly or at all. -She may be highly agitated, irritable and edgy. -She could have suicidal thoughts. And this list is not exhaustive. You may want to ask her to see a doctor..\nHow a person with bipolar thinks? The most significant feature of bipolar disorder is the presence of “mood episodes.” The symptoms of mania and depression can affect your ability to function normally. There are periods of time with completely normal moods in between episodes. It is difficult to predict when an episode will occur. Even if you have known the pattern of your symptoms in the past, it may change in the future..\nHow genetic is bipolar? It is important to remember that heredity only accounts for about 50% of the likelihood of developing bipolar disorder. There is no single gene responsible for the disorder, rather it appears to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.. Does Bipolar worsen with age? Bipolar disorder is not a normal part of aging. It is a mood disorder that occurs at any age. People with Bipolar disorder may experience periods of depression and periods of mania. Mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and birth control pills are some common medications that help treat bipolar disorder..\nAre bipolar people smart? Bipolar people are often seen as moody, and many people think they are just lazy. But in truth, they have a very real, very serious illness called bipolar disorder. Bipolar people are often misunderstood, and they often suffer in silence. Bipolar disorder, also known as manic depression, is a brain disorder that causes unusual shifts in a person’s mood, energy, activity levels and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. It can be a devastating illness and if not treated, it can lead to the worst kind of f.\nDo bipolar people hear voices? Yes, they do. Bipolar people often hear voices. Often they hear not just one voice, but several different ones. This is what’s called “hearing voices”. People with bipolar disorder are often misdiagnosed with schizophrenia, as the symptoms of both disorders may be quite similar. However, there are some major differences between the two. People with schizophrenia hear voices that are not there, that are completely made up by the patient’s delusional mind. This difference is the reason why people with bipolar disorder are often prescribed antidepressants to treat their symptoms, rather than antipsychotics..\n\nWe all experience a variety of moods such as happiness, sadness, and anger. Unpleasant moods and changes in mood are normal reactions in everyday life, and we can often identify the events that caused our mood to change. However, when we experience extreme mood changes that affect how we behave and function, these changes are often the result of a mood disorder. Bipolar disorder (formerly known as manic-depressive disorder) is a mood disorder that consists of periods of extremely elevated mood (mania), extremely low mood (depression), and normal mood. Bipolar disorder typically begins for people during adolescence and early adulthood. The most common onset is from the teenage years to the early 30s. It is unusual for bipolar disorder to begin in childhood without strong familial risk factors, and it is rare for its onset to occur after the age of 60 (unless it is associated with another medical condition). Bipolar disorder occurs in about 1% to 3% of the adult population, and men and women are affected equally. The rate of suicide for people with bipolar disorder is around 15 times higher than that of the general population. There is no single, proven cause of bipolar disorder, but research suggests that it is the result of abnormalities in the way some nerve cells in the brain function or communicate. Researchers also believe that there is a definite genetic link (family history) in which there is a higher risk for people who have a parent or full sibling (i.e., a first-degree relative) with bipolar disorder. Whatever the precise nature of the cause of bipolar disorder, it clearly makes people with the disorder more vulnerable to emotional and physical stresses. As a result, upsetting life experiences, alcohol, illicit drug use, lack of sleep, certain antidepressants, or other stresses can trigger episodes of illness, even though these stresses do not actually cause the disorder. Bipolar disorder is not the fault of the person suffering from it and is not the result of a \"weak\" or unstable personality. Rather, bipolar disorder is a treatable medical condition. Symptoms and Complications\nBipolar disorder is a condition in which the person's mood changes in cycles – from extremely high or irritable to extremely low and hopeless – over weeks to months. The nature of these mood changes varies from one person to the next. A person may go through periods of elevated mood, depressed mood, and times when mood is normal. The period of time that the extreme high and low moods are experienced are called episodes of mania and depression. It is less common for a person to alternate between mania and depression; in most, one or the other is predominant. Mania: During a manic episode, a person will experience a high, irritable, angry, or aggressive mood for at least one week that is not caused by drug abuse, medication, or other medical conditions. The person's mood disturbance will be severe enough to cause concerns from family or friends, and may warrant a hospital stay to prevent harm to self or other. In addition, they will experience 3 or more of the following:\n- needing little sleep\n- being more talkative than usual, often more loudly or quickly\n- having racing thoughts (thoughts that won't quiet)\n- being much more active than usual\n- being distracted, often by unimportant or irrelevant stimuli\n- having an inflated feeling of power, greatness, or importance (inflated self-esteem)\n- doing reckless things without concern about possible consequences (e.g., spending too much money, engaging in inappropriate sexual activity, or making risky business investments)\nA manic episode may also include psychotic symptoms such as delusions (firmly believing things that are not true) or hallucinations (hearing, feeling, or seeing things that are not there). A person going through a manic episode is unlikely to be able to keep up with important daily obligations, such as their job or schoolwork. Hypomania is a milder form of mania that has the same symptoms but less severe, and has less negative impact on a person's daily activities. Symptoms must last for at least 4 consecutive days. During a hypomanic episode, the person may have an elevated mood and be more productive, but the mood is uncharacteristic of the person's baseline personality. Because these episodes often feel good, the quest for hypomania may even cause some people with bipolar disorder to stop taking their medications.\n\n- Education and Science»\n- Psychology & Psychiatry\nA Light in the Dark: Breakthrough Insights on Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder\nIt is Time for a Global Reality Check! Since this author was a youngster, she closely studied biological, psychological conditions and profiling dysfunction such as mental disorder, abuse, addictions, domestic violence and criminal influences. For the entirety of her life, she has devoted significant efforts, study, observation to investigate the 'root causes' of such micro-psychological conditions that effectively manifest as more macro-sociological disorders in society and in our world. The culmination of this research and acute observances over the past 45 years is beginning to coalesce and certain insights can be gleaned that may offer treatment potential in intelligence and medical circles who may be equally invested in solving these mysteries of the mind and body. It is important to note, however, that there are certain parties that may not wish such mental conditions and disorders to be properly or effectively treated or even dare I say- cured. For there is significant employment, investments, systems, services, drugs and public policy that perpetually support it and parties who benefit from the generational cycles of illness, disease and disorder. It is true that psychiatric conditions or afflictions are the result of a combination of influences that are inherently genetic, environmental and causal. In fact, we currently all can suffer and be affected by biological and mental disorders. If you do not have a mental health condition of some sort, you may have a genetic predisposition to one and it is only a matter of a simple trigger be it an allergy, an infection, chemical exposure, a bacteria, a virus, a parasite or a trauma that can flick the switch on that gene and cause an expression or imbalance in your brain and body. If you have ever been ill, on antibiotics, vomited, overly fatigued, had lethargy, stressed, depressed, had stomach, intestinal or bowel issues, confusion or disorientation and insomnia or anxiety, sexual dysfunction or wasn't able to cope, you have experienced effects of a mental or a brain illness and most likely a biological infection. What many do not understand is that any affliction of the brain affects the body or vice versa. I must emphasize that the mind body and nuclear soul symbiotic health of a biological, psychological and neurological connected system is paramount to overall physical and mental health and well being. Few understand or treat the 'whole' organism. And that is what you are is..a complex organization of sybmbiotic cellular living bodies within an organism. And we as organisms are a macro-biological organizational system on this living planet we call, Mother Earth. Now I must comment that some organisms or persons' actions are more conducive to health while some are more conducive to disease while others are indifferent or ignorant. You do have a choice to be one of the above, in fact it is each and every person's responsibility to be a healthier organism and prevent disease and transmission with self-care and due diligence. I must express my frustration at the lack of personal self-care in western countries and the over use of biological warfare between nations that excessively exasperate and compound the issue causing pandemics leading to cycles of infections, the resurgence of diseases and social disorder that costs trillions in treatment, disable societies, judicial systems and medical services. There have been outright abuses and crimes by individuals, groups, corporations and nations using nuclear fusion of caustic and poisonous chemicals into items, crops, the food cycle and natural diets calling it voodoo, franken nutrition, treatment or witchcraft. But that is another article...let's get to the root causes. Schizophrenia is a genetic disease, cellular and mental disorder previously known as Multiple Personality Disorder. Go figure, they keep changing the disorder descriptions and renaming illnesses in the DSM manual of psychiatric disorders simply to confuse everyone. It is a disease of dysfunctional cellular processes that originates in the left side of the brain responsible for the most basic of logic, scientific thought, math, computations, memorization, recall and controls the right side of the body. This criss cross control functionality of the brain is referred to as X by some.\n\nThere are other mental disorders besides bipolar disorder, which can produce mood swings. For example, mood swings can be caused by general medical conditions or other physical illnesses that affect the body's regulatory systems. Suspect medical conditions include various brain chemical imbalances, hormone disorders (such as hyper- or hypothyroidism), bacterial or viral infections, and autoimmunity conditions (leading to body rhythm dysregulation). Such illnesses could cause people to experience bipolar-like mood swings even though they don't have actual bipolar disorder. See our section on Contemporary Understandings of Bipolar Disorder for a more detailed discussion of medical conditions, which must be ruled out prior to bipolar diagnosis. Equally confusing is the use of street drugs and\/or alcohol, which can lead to altered mood states. Intoxication with central nervous system stimulant drugs (such as Cocaine, or Methamphetamine) can easily mimic a manic state. Similarly, intoxication with central nervous system depressant drugs (such as alcohol, or Valium) can mimic a depressive state. When it is not clear if a mood condition is due to a drug or to a disease process, doctors will tend to hold off making definitive bipolar diagnoses until enough time has passed so as to allow any drug effect that might be affecting mood to metabolize and clear out of the affected person's system. As previously mentioned, manic people tend to show poor judgment and to be pleasure-seeking in the extreme. For this reason, it is not at all uncommon for people in the midst of a manic disorder episode to take drugs and\/or drink alcohol. Similarly, people experiencing a depressive episode tend to feel awful, and sometimes will \"self-medicate\" with street drugs and\/or alcohol in an attempt to help themselves feel better. . Though some short-term relief may be gained by such self-medication attempts, substance abuse and addiction problems can result in the long-term, which compounds the existing mental disorder. Addicts, of course, are at the mercy of the availability of their drugs; they may develop manic depressive mood symptoms as a result of withdrawal symptoms, or efforts to ward off experiencing withdrawal symptoms. When either of these situations occur, you have a situation where a true bipolar condition and drug effects may exist simultaneously. Once again, this sort of situation can be ruled out by a diagnosing doctor by simply letting enough time pass for the effects of any drugs or alcohol to wear off. There is perhaps a weak bi-directional causal relationship between substance abuse disorders and bipolar disorder. People who have bipolar affective disorder have an increased risk for developing substance abuse problems, and people who use substances may help to release whatever inborn potential or vulnerability they may have for developing bipolar disorder (see our section on the Diathesis-Stress Hypothesis for more detail). Whatever the true relationship is between bipolar conditions and substance abuse, it is not in question that the combination of the two conditions leaves people worse off than either alone. Complicating bipolar diagnosis further is the possibility that an individual with mood swings is suffering from a mental illness other than bipolar disorder. A number of other mental disorders are associated with mood swings. Mental disorders which may be commonly confused with bipolar disorder include Borderline Personality Disorder , Schizoaffective Disorder, Unipolar Depression, and Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder.","passages":[{"passage":"\"Can I see the test results, please?\" Let’s start with a true story. A colleague of mine in the US heard that her grandson had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital. As a long-standing critic of the psychiatric system she was concerned for his welfare and went to see him. She discovered that in the first few days he had been drugged into a stupor and she insisted on seeing the medical staff. Three psychiatrists told her that, sadly, her grandson had a bipolar disorder caused by a brain bio-chemical imbalance. Quietly, but firmly, she asked what evidence they had there was something wrong with his brain. They said that his mood and behaviour indicated a serious problem. She asked how they knew this problem was caused by brain biochemistry. Slightly uncomfortable, they vaguely referred to studies that indicated that this was the case. Much more confident now, my colleague responded that she knew of no studies that had ever confirmed this idea even though it is a common assumption in the psychiatric world. For good measure she quoted some studies that indicated that there was nothing wrong with the brains of people with all sorts of psychiatric labels. Sensing that they were dealing with someone who might actually have read the literature they asked what she wanted. Her grandson was quickly transferred to a unit offering talking therapies. My colleague didn’t ask the question that all patients, relatives and advocates should ask when confronted with the claim that a brain biochemical problem lies at the root of someone’s low mood or strange behaviour. She could have said, \"Can I see the test results, please?\" The truth is that, unlike all other branches of medicine, psychiatrists do not do physical tests on people to confirm their diagnoses. The reason is simple: there is nothing wrong with the brains of people diagnosed schizophrenic, bi-polar, depressed and so on. The organic hypothesis remains just that; an unproven hypothesis. Claims continue to be made in the scientific literature and popular press. David Cohen, another US activist, has noted that almost all the substances operating within the human body have been investigated as a possible cause of schizophrenia. This research is leaked to the press before it has been accepted in a peer-reviewed journal and \"the results are likely to be cited around the world, thought they may never make it to scientific publication\". We are also well aware of the massive conflicts of interest involved in the studies that do finally appear in the official literature. Effective Health Care, in reviewing the newest so-called anti-psychotic medication concluded, \"Most relevant trials are undertaken by those with clear pecuniary interest in the results\"1. There is no validity in psychiatric diagnosis2,3. Even if there were, after almost two hundred years, we have never found anything at all wrong with the brain biochemistry of people diagnosed with a host of so-called disorders. Some, conditions, for example, Alcohol-induced dementia do indeed show real signs of brain damage. This is rare. The studies on all the main diagnostic categories of psychiatry, however, are plagued by a significant problem: the people being tested have almost always already received psychotropic medication. In other words, if there is a blood, brain or liver disorder, this may well have been caused by the drugs, or ECT. Physical tests on people diagnosed, but not yet treated, by psychiatrists, would be the only way to find out if there really were a difference between these people and the general public. This never happens as most people first encounter a GP who, instead of asking for blood and other tests to demonstrate a psychiatric condition, simply prescribe a psychotropic drug or refer on to a psychiatrist. Imagine the same situation in oncology. You are told that you look like you have cancer. There are no tests offered to you. You are told you will have two operations, followed by radiotherapy and a course of drugs that makes your hair fall out. The idea is preposterous. You demand proof of your condition. An x-ray, a CT scan and blood and liver tests reveal that the diagnosis was accurate. Reassured, though still very scared you agree to the treatment. Psychiatrists of course do ask for tests like CT scans on their patients but these are to exclude the possibility of organic damage. In other words, they are checking to see if there is a real brain problem, evidence of illegal drug-use or whatever.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:b122e79e-187d-4e58-bfa1-2f2d3c4a1023>"]},{"passage":"Have you ever stopped to think about how the mental health stigma doesn’t make sense? So many of us walk around feeling ashamed of our struggles, trying to hide them from the rest of the world. Yet functioning with these immense internal difficulties actually evinces our strength! As actress Carrie Fisher wrote in Wishful Drinking:\n“Being bipolar can be an all-consuming challenge, requiring a lot of stamina and even more courage, so if you’re living with this illness and functioning at all, it’s something to be proud of, not ashamed of.”\nPlus, try this statistic on for size: according to the CDC, nearly 50% of U.S. adults will struggle with at least one mental illness in their lifetime. In this post, we’ll focus on the dual diagnosis of addiction and bipolar disorder. What Is Bipolar Disorder? Bipolar is a mood disorder characterized by emotional swings from high to low. People with bipolar deal with depressive “down” phases and manic “up” phases, and they struggle to find a healthy middle ground. In a depressive state, a person might be immobilized, unable to take care of their usual responsibilities. But in a manic state, that same person might work around the clock. One quick definition for bipolar is “experiencing extremes”. This disorder does have a genetic component, but an individual’s environment matters a great deal as well. Growing up in a physically, mentally, or emotionally traumatic environment is a strong risk factor. Why an Accurate Diagnosis Can Be Difficult\nHere are a few key reasons why bipolar disorder can be difficult to diagnose accurately:\nFirst, if a person is under the influence, it’s extremely challenging to provide an accurate diagnosis. Having people detox prior to diagnosis is ideal. Next, the bipolar label has increased in popularity in recent years. This is great for awareness, but it can also lead to misdiagnosis. For example, sometimes people who are dealing with clinical depression are misdiagnosed with bipolar because of the dramatic difference between their low-functioning depressive state and their usual functioning state. Similarly, rigid, black-and-white thinking can be confused with bipolar symptoms, and so can the aftereffects of trauma. Finally, when people have a great deal of conflict in their lives, they may be labeled as bipolar. But when they gain the tools they need to resolve those conflicts, often the level of internal tension changes significantly. In short, understanding bipolar disorder and addiction is critical for accurate diagnosis and treatment. True bipolar disorder involves an imbalance in brain chemistry, and it’s certainly a serious condition. Yet in our experience in running a residential addiction treatment center, we see people misdiagnosed as bipolar when in reality they have mental and emotional issues causing a lot of upset in their lives. That’s not brain chemistry; that’s just upset. We find that when such people heal those issues, the upset in their lives decreases dramatically. The Connection Between Addiction and Bipolar Disorder\nBipolar disorder is part of a family of mood disorders, including depression, anxiety, and seasonal affective disorder (SAD). While mood disorders can be caused or exacerbated by drug use, more often people with mood disorders use addictive substances to self-medicate. Many people with bipolar turn to substances during their depressive states. There is a particularly strong connection between bipolar and addiction. Statistics from DualDiagnosis.org suggest that 56% of people with bipolar disorder have experienced drug addiction. Healing from Bipolar and Addiction\nSeptember is National Recovery Month, and it’s also Self Awareness Month. This is fitting, as you can’t really have one without the other. Self awareness is an essential component of recovery, especially when you’re dealing with a dual diagnosis. That said, medication certainly has its place as well. If you find that you continue to struggle with emotional extremes after you’ve detoxed from substances, then medication may give you the support you need to maintain emotional stability. However, don’t shortchange yourself by skipping over the mental and emotional issues that contribute to mood disorders. Finding and addressing the root causes of physical disorders can minimize (or eliminate!) the need for medications to treat symptoms, and the same is true for emotional disorders.

The findings are not expected to lead to a genetic test for the risk of the condition but could help unravel the mystery of how it arises and lead to better treatments, they reported in the journal Nature Genetics. An international team of scientists examined the genomes of 10,596 people mainly from Britain and the United States, including 4,387 with bipolar disorder, also sometimes known as manic-depression. The researchers found those with bipolar disorder more likely to have certain variants of the ANK3 and CACNA1C genes. Proteins made by the two genes help govern the flow of sodium and calcium ions into and out of neurons in the brain, influencing the activity of these nerve cells. \"The key importance of this is that it gives us a clear idea of the sorts of chemicals and mechanisms in the brain that are involved in bipolar disorder,\" Nick Craddock of Britain's Cardiff University, who helped lead the study, said in a telephone interview. \"Over a number of years, that will help researchers to develop better approaches to diagnosis and treatment.\" Because it tends to run in families, scientists have been trying to pinpoint genes involved in bipolar disorder. This was the largest genetic analysis of its kind on the disease, which affects an estimated 1 percent to 3 percent of adults worldwide, Craddock said. The brain disorder causes extreme shifts in mood, energy and ability to function. It is marked by high periods of elation or irritability and low periods of sadness and hopelessness that can last months. The proper function of brain neurons depends on a delicate equilibrium between sodium and calcium, the researchers said. \"The brain operates according to how quickly calcium and sodium are going in and out of cells and how much of it goes in and out,\" Craddock said. The findings suggest that bipolar disorder may stem at least in part from malfunctions in the flow of these ions, which are electrically charged versions of the chemicals. There is a need for better treatment, Craddock said. Lithium, the most common, helps only about two-thirds of those with the disorder and can cause drowsiness, weight gain and mild shakiness. The U.S. government's National Institutes of Health helped fund the research. Dr. Thomas Insel, director of the NIH's National Institute of Mental Health, said the findings may help solve the puzzle that is bipolar disorder. \"It's not going to tell us the whole story -- it doesn't give you the whole puzzle -- but it's something to build on,\" Insel said in a telephone interview. Craddock said identifying the two gene variants probably will not be helpful in determining an individual's risk for the disorder because many who do not have the disease will have the genes.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:5ae6729d-06bc-4f01-bc7b-0b81db567919>"]},{"passage":"Bipolar disorder is one of the most difficult mental illnesses to diagnose and treat because of its complicated shifts between different symptoms. At the present time there is no cure for bipolar disorder but strategies such as medication and cognitive behavioral therapy to help minimize symptoms and manage the illness. However some researchers are looking for different methods that could use a more holistic approach to treating the disorder in the future. Mental illness often are closely related to issues in the brain that lead to certain mood problems and various behaviors. Medications are meant to help balance out chemicals in the brain that may be causing certain symptoms. However, researchers believe that helping to restore nerve cell health in the brain for better communication may go a long way to treat issues like bipolar disorder. In the past it was believed that bipolar disorder was caused by an imbalance of chemicals like serotonin or dopamine which led to depressed or elevated moods. Researchers now believe that neural plasticity may play a more important role in alleviated the symptoms of mania and depression. People with bipolar disorder tend to have atrophy of neurons in certain brain areas but improving nerve cells in these areas could potentially change the path of the disorder. Medications like lithium which are used in treating bipolar disorder were recently discovered to actually boost levels of proteins that help neurons maintain their function. This may explain why lithium has been shown to be effective as a long term treatment. Using other methods to improve the health of neurons in the brain may create a more focused and efficient way to reduce symptoms quickly. Although more research needs to be done to determine long term results, nerve and brain health may be the focus of bipolar treatment in the future.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:20e044c2-af29-4922-89b1-b0ccc357332a>"]},{"passage":"Bipolar Disorder (cont.) In this Article\nWhat are the risk factors for bipolar disorder? Scientists are learning about the possible causes of bipolar disorder. Most scientists agree that there is no single cause. Rather, many factors likely act together to produce the illness or increase risk. Bipolar disorder tends to run in families, so researchers are looking for genes that may increase a person's chance of developing the illness. Genes are the \"building blocks\" of heredity. They help control how the body and brain work and grow. Genes are contained inside a person's cells that are passed down from parents to children. Children with a parent or sibling who has bipolar disorder are four to six times more likely to develop the illness, compared with children who do not have a family history of bipolar disorder. However, most children with a family history of bipolar disorder will not develop the illness. Genetic research on bipolar disorder is being helped by advances in technology. This type of research is now much quicker and more far-reaching than in the past. One example is the launch of the Bipolar Disorder Phenome Database, funded in part by NIMH. Using the database, scientists will be able to link visible signs of the disorder with the genes that may influence them. So far, researchers using this database found that most people with bipolar disorder had:\nThe researchers also identified certain traits that appeared to run in families, including:\nScientists continue to study these traits, which may help them find the genes that cause bipolar disorder some day. But genes are not the only risk factor for bipolar disorder. Studies of identical twins have shown that the twin of a person with bipolar illness does not always develop the disorder. This is important because identical twins share all of the same genes. The study results suggest factors besides genes are also at work. Rather, it is likely that many different genes and a person's environment are involved. However, scientists do not yet fully understand how these factors interact to cause bipolar disorder. Brain structure and functioning\nBrain-imaging studies are helping scientists learn what happens in the brain of a person with bipolar disorder. Newer brain-imaging tools, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), allow researchers to take pictures of the living brain at work. These tools help scientists study the brain's structure and activity. Some imaging studies show how the brains of people with bipolar disorder may differ from the brains of healthy people or people with other mental disorders. For example, one study using MRI found that the pattern of brain development in children with bipolar disorder was similar to that in children with \"multi-dimensional impairment,\" a disorder that causes symptoms that overlap somewhat with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. This suggests that the common pattern of brain development may be linked to general risk for unstable moods. Learning more about these differences, along with information gained from genetic studies, helps scientists better understand bipolar disorder. Someday scientists may be able to predict which types of treatment will work most effectively. They may even find ways to prevent bipolar disorder. How is bipolar disorder diagnosed? The first step in getting a proper diagnosis is to talk to a doctor, who may conduct a physical examination, an interview, and lab tests. Bipolar disorder cannot currently be identified through a blood test or a brain scan, but these tests can help rule out other contributing factors, such as a stroke or brain tumor. If the problems are not caused by other illnesses, the doctor may conduct a mental health evaluation. The doctor may also provide a referral to a trained mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist, who is experienced in diagnosing and treating bipolar disorder. The doctor or mental health professional should conduct a complete diagnostic evaluation. He or she should discuss any family history of bipolar disorder or other mental illnesses and get a complete history of symptoms. The doctor or mental health professionals should also talk to the person's close relatives or spouse and note how they describe the person's symptoms and family medical history. People with bipolar disorder are more likely to seek help when they are depressed than when experiencing mania or hypomania. Therefore, a careful medical history is needed to assure that bipolar disorder is not mistakenly diagnosed as major depressive disorder, which is also called unipolar depression.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:83a19198-4d7a-4dd9-b850-5ad97b6a05ea>"]},{"passage":"2.8 percent of U.S adults live with bipolar disorder. Some of them have episodes several times a year; others experience them rarely. Attacks may last for days or weeks. Unfortunately, this condition has no cure. A common misconception is that this disorder is just about having mood swings. The truth is, it is a severe mental condition that can affect one’s quality of life. There is plenty to know about bipolar disorder, including available treatment options that help manage the bipolar disorder symptoms. What Is Bipolar Disorder? Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, and concentration. Everyone has ups and downs, but with bipolar disorder, these changes are severe. The changes range from episodes of extreme highs called mania to extreme lows called depression. Unlike ordinary mood swings, the mood changes of bipolar disorder are so intense that they may interfere with relationships, productivity at work, and daily activities. What Are the Causes and Triggers of Bipolar Disorder? There is no apparent cause of disorder bipolar. It results from a combination of genetic and environmental causes. Certain factors may trigger episodes in people who are predisposed to the condition. Is bipolar disorder hereditary? Yes, it is. You are more likely to develop this condition if someone in your immediate family has it. The risk is higher if either your parents or your twin has the disease. It is clear that more than one gene is involved. Researchers are yet to determine the particular genes responsible for the disorder. However, not everyone with an inherited vulnerability develops the disease. Therefore, genes are not the only cause. Abnormalities in Brain Structure and Functioning\nSome studies indicate that the brain structure and functioning of people with bipolar disorder are different from that of people who have no mental illnesses. However, there is not enough information about these differences to inform diagnosis. Therefore, health care providers base their diagnosis on a patient’s symptoms and history rather than brain imaging. Research indicates that external factors can trigger episodes of mania or depression. Environmental influences may also make existing symptoms worse. Some of the most common environmental triggers are:\nStressful life events can trigger the disorder in someone with a genetic vulnerability. Such events involve drastic changes such as losing a loved one, going away to college, losing a job, or moving. Positive life events such as getting married can also trigger an episode. Substance abuse alone cannot cause bipolar disorder. However, it can trigger an episode or worsen the progression of symptoms. Drugs such as cocaine, amphetamines, or ecstasy can trigger mania. Alcohol can trigger depression. Manic episodes are expected during the summer. Depressive episodes are typical during fall, winter, and spring. Not getting enough sleep can trigger a manic episode. The quality of sleep is also essential. Restless nights can worsen symptoms and make extreme behavior more likely. What Are the Different Types of Bipolar Disorder? According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM), there are three main types of bipolar disorder based on the nature and severity of symptoms. It is the classic form of this disorder and was originally referred to as “manic depression.” One may experience a sudden, extreme shift in moods, and their behavior may escalate quickly. Individuals with this type of bipolar disorder experience episodes of severe mania. A diagnosis of bipolar I mean that you have experienced at least one manic episode that lasts longer than one week. 90% of people with this disorder also experience periods of depression. Without treatment, manic episodes last 3-6 months, and depressive episodes last 6-12 months. Individuals with this type of disorder experience a less severe form of mania called hypomania. A diagnosis of bipolar II means you often experience major depressive episode. Instead of mania, you experience a less extreme episode called hypomania. Hypomania often becomes worse without treatment and may result in severe mania or depression. Individuals with this type of disorder have symptoms that do not meet the diagnostic requirements for hypomania or depression. They experience mild symptoms that last for 1-2 years. What Are Signs and Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder? Bipolar disorder is typically diagnosed in late adolescence or early adulthood. Symptoms can appear in children, pregnant women, or after childbirth. A manic episode does not always turn someone into a maniac. In this state, a person may feel extreme highs and engage in risky .","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:3e97e2a2-e20e-4971-b3f4-9da8627c2acd>"]},{"passage":"Bipolar disorder usually begins in early adulthood, between eighteen and thirty years of age. The earlier symptoms appear, the more severe the illness tends to be. Bipolar disorder typically begins after a stressful life event, such as the death of a loved one, a divorce, or financial problems. Sometimes an illness, such as a physical injury or stroke, can trigger symptoms. Most people with bipolar disorder have at least one episode of depression, along with one or more episodes of mania. It’s important to seek treatment for bipolar disorder if you or someone you know has symptoms..\nWhat is the main cause of bipolar disorder? Bipolar disorder is a brain disorder that causes extreme shifts in mood, energy, and activity levels. It occurs in 1-2% of the general population. There is strong evidence that genes play a role in causing depression and bipolar disorder. Many genes are involved in how the brain works. Studies show that an abnormality in the genes that control the brain chemical serotonin may be responsible for bipolar disorder in many patients..\nWhy are females so bipolar? There are several reasons behind this question. Some of the factors include nature and nurture. Females have biologically programmed mood swings. This is because they have to carry the baby for nine months and therefore are more sensitive. Males, on the other hand, are more on the aggressive side. This is also because of the different hormones present in the brain. Again, nurture is an important factor. Society disapprove of men showing their emotions and so, through a series of upbringing, boys are made to hide their feelings. When the society encourages the opposite in girls, the difference in behavior is natural..\nWhat are the signs of bipolar in a woman? Hi , A woman who is suffering from bipolar disorder may show some of the following signs. -She may be in high spirits one moment and then her mood could suddenly change to being depressed. -She may not be able to sleep properly or at all. -She may be highly agitated, irritable and edgy. -She could have suicidal thoughts. And this list is not exhaustive. You may want to ask her to see a doctor..\nHow a person with bipolar thinks? The most significant feature of bipolar disorder is the presence of “mood episodes.” The symptoms of mania and depression can affect your ability to function normally. There are periods of time with completely normal moods in between episodes. It is difficult to predict when an episode will occur. Even if you have known the pattern of your symptoms in the past, it may change in the future..\nHow genetic is bipolar? It is important to remember that heredity only accounts for about 50% of the likelihood of developing bipolar disorder. There is no single gene responsible for the disorder, rather it appears to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.. Does Bipolar worsen with age? Bipolar disorder is not a normal part of aging. It is a mood disorder that occurs at any age. People with Bipolar disorder may experience periods of depression and periods of mania. Mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and birth control pills are some common medications that help treat bipolar disorder..\nAre bipolar people smart? Bipolar people are often seen as moody, and many people think they are just lazy. But in truth, they have a very real, very serious illness called bipolar disorder. Bipolar people are often misunderstood, and they often suffer in silence. Bipolar disorder, also known as manic depression, is a brain disorder that causes unusual shifts in a person’s mood, energy, activity levels and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. It can be a devastating illness and if not treated, it can lead to the worst kind of f.\nDo bipolar people hear voices? Yes, they do. Bipolar people often hear voices. Often they hear not just one voice, but several different ones. This is what’s called “hearing voices”. People with bipolar disorder are often misdiagnosed with schizophrenia, as the symptoms of both disorders may be quite similar. However, there are some major differences between the two. People with schizophrenia hear voices that are not there, that are completely made up by the patient’s delusional mind. This difference is the reason why people with bipolar disorder are often prescribed antidepressants to treat their symptoms, rather than antipsychotics..","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:5f54adda-145f-4f64-bf41-d75650ecd48a>"]},{"passage":"We all experience a variety of moods such as happiness, sadness, and anger. Unpleasant moods and changes in mood are normal reactions in everyday life, and we can often identify the events that caused our mood to change. However, when we experience extreme mood changes that affect how we behave and function, these changes are often the result of a mood disorder. Bipolar disorder (formerly known as manic-depressive disorder) is a mood disorder that consists of periods of extremely elevated mood (mania), extremely low mood (depression), and normal mood. Bipolar disorder typically begins for people during adolescence and early adulthood. The most common onset is from the teenage years to the early 30s. It is unusual for bipolar disorder to begin in childhood without strong familial risk factors, and it is rare for its onset to occur after the age of 60 (unless it is associated with another medical condition). Bipolar disorder occurs in about 1% to 3% of the adult population, and men and women are affected equally. The rate of suicide for people with bipolar disorder is around 15 times higher than that of the general population. There is no single, proven cause of bipolar disorder, but research suggests that it is the result of abnormalities in the way some nerve cells in the brain function or communicate. Researchers also believe that there is a definite genetic link (family history) in which there is a higher risk for people who have a parent or full sibling (i.e., a first-degree relative) with bipolar disorder. Whatever the precise nature of the cause of bipolar disorder, it clearly makes people with the disorder more vulnerable to emotional and physical stresses. As a result, upsetting life experiences, alcohol, illicit drug use, lack of sleep, certain antidepressants, or other stresses can trigger episodes of illness, even though these stresses do not actually cause the disorder. Bipolar disorder is not the fault of the person suffering from it and is not the result of a \"weak\" or unstable personality. Rather, bipolar disorder is a treatable medical condition. Symptoms and Complications\nBipolar disorder is a condition in which the person's mood changes in cycles – from extremely high or irritable to extremely low and hopeless – over weeks to months. The nature of these mood changes varies from one person to the next. A person may go through periods of elevated mood, depressed mood, and times when mood is normal. The period of time that the extreme high and low moods are experienced are called episodes of mania and depression. It is less common for a person to alternate between mania and depression; in most, one or the other is predominant. Mania: During a manic episode, a person will experience a high, irritable, angry, or aggressive mood for at least one week that is not caused by drug abuse, medication, or other medical conditions. The person's mood disturbance will be severe enough to cause concerns from family or friends, and may warrant a hospital stay to prevent harm to self or other. In addition, they will experience 3 or more of the following:\n- needing little sleep\n- being more talkative than usual, often more loudly or quickly\n- having racing thoughts (thoughts that won't quiet)\n- being much more active than usual\n- being distracted, often by unimportant or irrelevant stimuli\n- having an inflated feeling of power, greatness, or importance (inflated self-esteem)\n- doing reckless things without concern about possible consequences (e.g., spending too much money, engaging in inappropriate sexual activity, or making risky business investments)\nA manic episode may also include psychotic symptoms such as delusions (firmly believing things that are not true) or hallucinations (hearing, feeling, or seeing things that are not there). A person going through a manic episode is unlikely to be able to keep up with important daily obligations, such as their job or schoolwork. Hypomania is a milder form of mania that has the same symptoms but less severe, and has less negative impact on a person's daily activities. Symptoms must last for at least 4 consecutive days. During a hypomanic episode, the person may have an elevated mood and be more productive, but the mood is uncharacteristic of the person's baseline personality. Because these episodes often feel good, the quest for hypomania may even cause some people with bipolar disorder to stop taking their medications.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:f689f908-3741-4a60-b398-829a1a7f9ff9>"]},{"passage":"- Education and Science»\n- Psychology & Psychiatry\nA Light in the Dark: Breakthrough Insights on Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder\nIt is Time for a Global Reality Check! Since this author was a youngster, she closely studied biological, psychological conditions and profiling dysfunction such as mental disorder, abuse, addictions, domestic violence and criminal influences. For the entirety of her life, she has devoted significant efforts, study, observation to investigate the 'root causes' of such micro-psychological conditions that effectively manifest as more macro-sociological disorders in society and in our world. The culmination of this research and acute observances over the past 45 years is beginning to coalesce and certain insights can be gleaned that may offer treatment potential in intelligence and medical circles who may be equally invested in solving these mysteries of the mind and body. It is important to note, however, that there are certain parties that may not wish such mental conditions and disorders to be properly or effectively treated or even dare I say- cured. For there is significant employment, investments, systems, services, drugs and public policy that perpetually support it and parties who benefit from the generational cycles of illness, disease and disorder. It is true that psychiatric conditions or afflictions are the result of a combination of influences that are inherently genetic, environmental and causal. In fact, we currently all can suffer and be affected by biological and mental disorders. If you do not have a mental health condition of some sort, you may have a genetic predisposition to one and it is only a matter of a simple trigger be it an allergy, an infection, chemical exposure, a bacteria, a virus, a parasite or a trauma that can flick the switch on that gene and cause an expression or imbalance in your brain and body. If you have ever been ill, on antibiotics, vomited, overly fatigued, had lethargy, stressed, depressed, had stomach, intestinal or bowel issues, confusion or disorientation and insomnia or anxiety, sexual dysfunction or wasn't able to cope, you have experienced effects of a mental or a brain illness and most likely a biological infection. What many do not understand is that any affliction of the brain affects the body or vice versa. I must emphasize that the mind body and nuclear soul symbiotic health of a biological, psychological and neurological connected system is paramount to overall physical and mental health and well being. Few understand or treat the 'whole' organism. And that is what you are is..a complex organization of sybmbiotic cellular living bodies within an organism. And we as organisms are a macro-biological organizational system on this living planet we call, Mother Earth. Now I must comment that some organisms or persons' actions are more conducive to health while some are more conducive to disease while others are indifferent or ignorant. You do have a choice to be one of the above, in fact it is each and every person's responsibility to be a healthier organism and prevent disease and transmission with self-care and due diligence. I must express my frustration at the lack of personal self-care in western countries and the over use of biological warfare between nations that excessively exasperate and compound the issue causing pandemics leading to cycles of infections, the resurgence of diseases and social disorder that costs trillions in treatment, disable societies, judicial systems and medical services. There have been outright abuses and crimes by individuals, groups, corporations and nations using nuclear fusion of caustic and poisonous chemicals into items, crops, the food cycle and natural diets calling it voodoo, franken nutrition, treatment or witchcraft. But that is another article...let's get to the root causes. Schizophrenia is a genetic disease, cellular and mental disorder previously known as Multiple Personality Disorder. Go figure, they keep changing the disorder descriptions and renaming illnesses in the DSM manual of psychiatric disorders simply to confuse everyone. It is a disease of dysfunctional cellular processes that originates in the left side of the brain responsible for the most basic of logic, scientific thought, math, computations, memorization, recall and controls the right side of the body. This criss cross control functionality of the brain is referred to as X by some.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:1fbb1387-a898-4870-a096-48e12b5ff14a>"]},{"passage":"There are other mental disorders besides bipolar disorder, which can produce mood swings. For example, mood swings can be caused by general medical conditions or other physical illnesses that affect the body's regulatory systems. Suspect medical conditions include various brain chemical imbalances, hormone disorders (such as hyper- or hypothyroidism), bacterial or viral infections, and autoimmunity conditions (leading to body rhythm dysregulation). Such illnesses could cause people to experience bipolar-like mood swings even though they don't have actual bipolar disorder. See our section on Contemporary Understandings of Bipolar Disorder for a more detailed discussion of medical conditions, which must be ruled out prior to bipolar diagnosis. Equally confusing is the use of street drugs and\/or alcohol, which can lead to altered mood states. Intoxication with central nervous system stimulant drugs (such as Cocaine, or Methamphetamine) can easily mimic a manic state. Similarly, intoxication with central nervous system depressant drugs (such as alcohol, or Valium) can mimic a depressive state. When it is not clear if a mood condition is due to a drug or to a disease process, doctors will tend to hold off making definitive bipolar diagnoses until enough time has passed so as to allow any drug effect that might be affecting mood to metabolize and clear out of the affected person's system. As previously mentioned, manic people tend to show poor judgment and to be pleasure-seeking in the extreme. For this reason, it is not at all uncommon for people in the midst of a manic disorder episode to take drugs and\/or drink alcohol. Similarly, people experiencing a depressive episode tend to feel awful, and sometimes will \"self-medicate\" with street drugs and\/or alcohol in an attempt to help themselves feel better. . Though some short-term relief may be gained by such self-medication attempts, substance abuse and addiction problems can result in the long-term, which compounds the existing mental disorder. Addicts, of course, are at the mercy of the availability of their drugs; they may develop manic depressive mood symptoms as a result of withdrawal symptoms, or efforts to ward off experiencing withdrawal symptoms. When either of these situations occur, you have a situation where a true bipolar condition and drug effects may exist simultaneously. Once again, this sort of situation can be ruled out by a diagnosing doctor by simply letting enough time pass for the effects of any drugs or alcohol to wear off. There is perhaps a weak bi-directional causal relationship between substance abuse disorders and bipolar disorder. People who have bipolar affective disorder have an increased risk for developing substance abuse problems, and people who use substances may help to release whatever inborn potential or vulnerability they may have for developing bipolar disorder (see our section on the Diathesis-Stress Hypothesis for more detail). Whatever the true relationship is between bipolar conditions and substance abuse, it is not in question that the combination of the two conditions leaves people worse off than either alone. Complicating bipolar diagnosis further is the possibility that an individual with mood swings is suffering from a mental illness other than bipolar disorder. A number of other mental disorders are associated with mood swings. Mental disorders which may be commonly confused with bipolar disorder include Borderline Personality Disorder , Schizoaffective Disorder, Unipolar Depression, and Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:1edce292-ebeb-4980-b4fc-a0a21d967143>"]}]}

This is the first-ever toll road in the country and was developed by the Uganda National Road Authority\nThe consultation for this billion project between the Government of Uganda and China began in 2009. It was meant to improve traffic conditions and mitigate the congestion on the bypass and the distributor roads in urban areas. Its routes and Design details\nThis infrastructure has two lanes in each direction and two road sections (36.94km long section and 12.68km long link road). The speed limit on this road ranges between 50km\/ -100km\/h. Its 36.94km long section is divided into two parts whereby the first 24.9km stretch of the sections starts at a point on the Kampala Northern Bypass and runs along the new route before ending at Abayita ababiri. The 12.04km section starts at the Interchange (Abayita ababiri) and winds along the existing Kampala-Entebbe road. 7.4km of it was widened and 4.64km upgraded to the latest standards. Apart from that, its 12.68km long roads originate from the highway at Kajjansi interchange and continue eastwards up to Munyonyo. Bridges and Interchanges on the Expressway\nAdding to the four interchanges at Kajjansi, Busega, Lweza and Mpala, this expressway features nineteen over-bridges and eighteen underpasses that provide access to other areas around. Besides that, three main toll plazas were built on the expressway at Mpala, Kajjansi and Busega. Mpala and Kajjansi toll plazas have five gates. The Busega toll plaza differs itself unique with six toll gates. Moreover, two suspension bridges that measure 200m and 500m by length were put up over the Lubiji swamp in Busega and Kyengera. Its highway includes a 75m long bridge at Kajjansi and the 1.45m long suspension bridge over Nambigirwa swamp. The 240 pillars that support Nambigirwa swamp have a lifespan of 100 years and were installed to a depth of 55m. The Main Contractors\nUNRA awarded the design-build contract to China Communication Construction Company in October 2010. Then in May 2012, Beijing Expressway Supervision was selected as the consulting engineer for the supervision of the design and construction of this road. The site project management, investigations and laboratory tests, and geotechnical survey services for the expressway were provided between January 2012 and 2013 by the Ugandan consulting firm Project Management and Engineering. Thereafter UNRA engaged the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank as the transaction adviser for this project. The IFC then contracted IMC Worldwide and Vetiver Associates to provide preliminary assessment for the toll road\nFinancing for the Project\nIt was jointly funded by the government of Uganda and the Exim Bank of China. Of $476 m for the project, Uganda contributed only USD 126m and the remaining part of USD350m came from the pockets of China Exim Bank but given as a preferential buyer credit loan. The agreement was signed by GoU in May 2011. This loan is to be paid back in a period of 40 years by the government through collecting taxes from its citizens. More to be paid is the USD 40m used for compensation to the landowners who were vacated from areas where the expressway passed. What are the Benefits of this toll road? The main aim of this world-class carriageway was to ease traffic congestion on main roads in Kampala city and its suburbs. Uganda’s road traffic is growing at an estimated rate of 4.5 per cent per year. This is due to the increased number of vehicles in Kampala and other cities. This path will also reduce the travel time from Kampala to Entebbe or vice versor. It takes about 30 minutes. This is time-saving when compared to 120 minutes for someone who is using the old Kampala – Entebbe road.\n\nIn this series we are doing a deep dive into the sourcing process today, and, in particular discussing what is involved, what is typically done (manually), and whether or not it should be that way. We have already completed our initial discussion of the initial project request review phase, the follow up needs assessment, the strategy selection phase, the communication phase, the analysis phase, and the negotiations phase. Now we are in the final contracting phase. At first glance, it looks like this is the second most strategic and human-driven phase there is, second only to negotiation, as it is humans (and lawyers in particular) who typically define standard terms and conditions, humans who identify risk and mitigation strategies, humans who define obligations, and humans who analyze the contract for compliance to goals. But is this the case? So in this final step, the contract step, we have these final sub-steps:\n- Standard Terms and Conditions\n- Modification & Risk Mitigation to Supplier & Country\n- Key Metadata definition and obligation specification\n- Contract Analytics\nIf all of the standard terms and conditions are in existing contracts and the contract clause \/ template repository, there’s no reason that a system cannot automatically scan the contracts and repositories, identify the standard organizational terms in every contract, identify the standard terms for the category, and identify any terms, often not included, that would be relevant to the category. Probabilities can be applied and contract terms organized by weight. The buyer can then just bulk select or bulk reject the relevant clauses. In the modification and risk mitigation step, a contract analytics engine can be applied to determine how well a particular clause addresses a certain risk of relevance to the organization based on context models and differentials. It can then compare that clause to the clauses that best address the risk and identify the necessary modifications, and do so specifically from a supplier or geographic context. In the key metadata definition and obligation specification step, the goal is to identify the right metadata that needs to be tracked against the contract. This will be dependent on the terms and conditions, the goals, the obligations, and other key information that will be specific to the contract. However, contract analytics can identify, or at least suggest, much of this as well automatically based upon similar contracts, similar terms, similar goals, and similar obligations. This can greatly reduce the effort required by a buyer. In the final step, the contract analytics step, the identification of risks, variances from a norm, and non-standard clauses can often be better identified by a contracts analytics engine that can cross-compare potentially risky clauses and variant clauses across hundreds, if not thousands, of contracts and identify deviations from the norm. A user just has to decide whether the variance is enough to be of interest to them, and properly setting a threshold can eliminate the majority of those variances that are not. In other words, at the end of the day, contract analytics identifies the majority of standard terms and conditions that are of interest, the majority of standard clauses that will need modifications to address supplier and country risk, the relevant metadata and obligations associated with the contract, and any clauses that can be considered variant enough to warrant special consideration. The majority of the work can be automated with a good contract analytics engine — the role of the buyer is to apply their intelligence to determine how accurate and effective it is. As the buyer trains the engine, it will become more and more accurate over time and the strategic work will be reduced to hours, sometimes minutes for simple contracts, compared to days or weeks. In other words, the more we explore the sourcing process, the more we find out how truly tactical, or at least automatable, the majority of it is.\n\nThis agreement (in conjunction with the trade agreement) contains all understanding and agreement between the parties as to the purpose of this agreement and replaces all agreements, documents, projections, financial data, statements and advance guarantees, orally orally, explicit or implied, between the parties concerned and their related companies, representatives and agents concerned with respect to the purpose of this agreement. the offer or terms and conditions that brought the parties together. This is the “meat” of the contract, and perhaps the one that your lawyer will offer most of the instructions until you get the ride. But people rarely go wrong when they are too specific; it is the lack of essential details or uncertainty that can cause problems. If you enter into a z.B business contract to sell your office copier, you must provide details such as a description of the equipment, sale price, terms of sale and date of transaction. There are six essential elements necessary for a contract to be valid (enforceable through the courts). The first three, which are considered together, refer to the agreement itself and the other three relate to the parties who enter into the contract. Contractual guarantees are less important conditions and are not fundamental to the agreement. They cannot terminate a contract if the guarantees are not fulfilled, but they can claim damages for the losses incurred. While these are some of the most common legal agreements you might see in an economic context, they can cover an almost infinite number of topics as long as the elements are in place and are not prohibited by law. And while some contracts may not need to be written, ALWAYS is a better idea to do so. Both parties must be “reasonable” to understand the seriousness of the situation and understand what is necessary. This definition requires that neither party be minor, both must be sober (not under the influence of drugs or alcohol when signing the contract) and no rehabilitation can be mentally deficient. If a party is not competent, the contract is not valid and the unmarried party may refuse (ignore) the contract. Contract management is part of running a small business. They will have a number of business relationships that involve some kind of contractual obligation or obligation. Don`t waste time negotiating a commercial contract with someone who doesn`t have the power to make a binding decision. It should be in the person`s best interest to ensure that you are complying with the obligations of the agreement. Legality should be the simplest part of the contract. This means that the terms and conditions must be legal; If not, the contract is not valid. For example, the sale of a photocopier is legal; Breaking into a closed store in the middle of the night, stealing a photocopier and selling it on an online shopping site is not the case. Each contract must include a specific offer and acceptance of that specific offer. Both parties must accept their free will. Neither party can be forced or forced to sign the contract and both parties must agree to the same conditions. These three conditions imply the intention of the parties to create a binding agreement. If one or both parties are not serious, there is no contract. TIP: If it is not possible to have a written contract, make sure you have other documentation such as emails, offers or notes of your discussions to help you identify what has been agreed. Contractual terms are fundamental to the agreement.\n\nThere may always be instances where the contract will be in question, especially if there’s a third party that may cause a burden. For instance, if you have a contract to buy a house but amid the transaction, a hurricane comes by and destroys it, what would it entail? Would the buyer still need to purchase it with the same amount or would it be less? You would also need to indicate what each party should and should not do. 4. Make sure to elaborate on the terms and conditions in the contract. Be specific and layout all the exact terms to avoid confusion, especially if this agreement affects a whole organization or future leaders. If there are damages or liabilities which the opposite party accepts, this too should be included in the terms. 5. Of course, all contracts can also end as agreed by both parties so it is also advisable to add a termination clause. This clause states all the legal ways of removing one party or both parties from such agreement without breach. This is most essential for long term contacts. 6. Never forget to sign and notarize. Make a contract legal by obtaining the signature of both parties which also means naming it after those involved. Having it notarized is also essential as it will make the contract a public instrument and can be used in court. It means nothing if the offer is accepted but has no written proof. If there should be changes, negotiation should be done and altered in the contract. 7. Lastly, make sure that all things agreed are legal and binding. Consider the age of the people involved, the nature of the industry and if the agreement was made in good faith. Any fraudulent transactions or threats can void the contract. Format of a contract\nThere’s no definite format for contracts since its content can go long or short, depending on the agreement. The essential elements that need to be found on a contract though can be summed up in this sample which elaborates on the parts of a client-vendor contract. This is a short description of the two parties who are in agreement, the sum of the project, duration of the project or date, and the monetary value or cost of the agreement. Provide information about the agreement that includes the job, duties, responsibilities, and promises of the vendor and the client. If there are payment terms involved, this will be considered a responsibility for the client. 3. Scope of work\nThis part elaborates on the deliverables of the vendor. If there is a budget involved, explain in detail what they get in return. Explain the inclusions, freebies (if any), limitations and any process that should be observed. Indicate how a situation be managed when things don’t go as planned. May it be changes, challenges, “acts of God” such as interventions from nature, or anything affecting the agreement to change. Place the additional fees or workload that should be included if there are any. 5. Rights of clients and vendors\nIf this was a product such as music, graphic design or photos, copyright ownerships can be elaborated in the contract. You can indicate the limitations of where it can or cannot be used, you can also explain if the work is completely turned over to the client or if a non-editable work is only given. If you don’t want this work to be used in billboards, you can also limit the ownership to digital use. As long as it was agreed, it can be placed on the contract. This is often optional for small online businesses or freelancers but for big companies, this is a must. Explain the duration of which your company is willing to fix\/return or exchange the product or service. It is recommended though that the date be specific rather than placing a number of days in the contract to avoid loopholes. Of course, if the warranty is over, the question still is what happens next? What should the client pay for your company to fix things after the expiration of the warranty? 7. Fees and payment method\nWill the payment be paid in full once the work is done? Is there a 50% down payment required before the project is started? Will there be a monthly fee or additional fee when plans change? How would the timeline look like? These are the common questions that you should ask yourself when drafting this section. If you can, it is best to assign an amount for every milestone reached, especially if the payment terms are in staggered payment terms. Not all partnerships and client-vendor relationships work. If there is a need to cancel the contract, this section should indicate what are valid premises, the conditions and what should be done to cancel the whole agreement. 9. Acceptance by signature\nMake sure to get it signed and sealed!\n\n• 3rd Contract Large-scale Prime Construction (Prime). USAID\/Indonesia originally planned on awarding this contract in September 2006 to complete the remaining road construction, including bridges and culverts. However, this was delayed because the Mission and prospective contractor did not reach agreement on price. In October 2006, the Mission began a new solicitation process and the contract was awarded in June 2007. The project was scheduled to be completed by February 2010. 1 A Strategic Objective Agreement is the principal bilateral grant agreement used by USAID with a foreign government or a subdivision of it. Although USAID\/Indonesia originally committed to reconstruct the entire 243 km roadway between Banda Aceh and Meulaboh, the Government of Japan through its Japan International Cooperation System (JICS) was already rehabilitating the existing road from Calang to Meulaboh. In June 2006, USAID\/Indonesia, JICS, and the GOI reached an agreement that there would be a single route for the entire roadway between Banda Aceh and Meulaboh, and that JICS would continue its road work from Calang to Meulaboh. As a result, USAID\/Indonesia reduced its original project scope to about 144 km from 243 km, which included building two bypasses in the JICS road segment. Figure 1 shows a map of the Aceh road project, including the JICS segment. Figure 1: Map of the Aceh Road Project\nContracts Start Date Finish Date Road Length Bridges Culverts Priority Oct 2006 Dec 2007 40 km 14 65 Prime Jun 2007 Feb 2010 104 km 17 128 Total 144 km 31 193 In November 2005, the OIG conducted an audit of USAID\/Indonesia’s Banda Aceh-Lamno road reconstruction activities implemented by WiKa for the priority road segments. 2 The OIG concluded that it could not determine whether all of the road reconstruction activities were on schedule to be completed by the overall project completion date and within the overall estimated costs because the Mission did not have an approved road design or an approved implementation plan in place. 2 OIG, Audit of USAID\/Indonesia’s Banda AcehLamno Road Reconstruction Activities Under Its Tsunami Recovery and Reconstruction Program , Report No. 5-497-06-003-P (Manila, Philippines: March 30, 2006)\nIn October 2006, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) conducted a review of USAID\/Indonesia’s road reconstruction project as part of its Congressionally mandated monitoring of U.S. reconstruction assistance to tsunami-affected countries. In its report, GAO concluded that USAID\/Indonesia faced increased risk that it may not successfully complete the project at planned cost and on schedule because of factors typically related to the difficulty of operating in a post-disaster environment, such as increased construction costs and delays in land acquisition. 3 As a result, USAID\/Indonesia did realize an increase in costs above the original government estimate. As of March 31, 2007, the total budget for the Aceh road project was estimated to cost $253 million, of which USAID\/Indonesia had obligated about $103 million and disbursed $18 million for Aceh road project activities.

(March 2007) AUDIT OBJECTIVE The Regional Inspector General\/Manila conducted this audit as part of its fiscal year 2007 annual audit plan to answer the following question: Is USAID\/Indonesia managing the Aceh Road Reconstruction Project under its • Tsunami Recovery and Reconstruction Program to minimize the risk of not completing the project on schedule and at planned cost? Appendix I contains a discussion of the audit’s scope and methodology. 3 GAO, Foreign Assistance USAID Signature Tsunami Reconstruction Efforts in Indonesia and Sri Lanka Exceed Initial Cost and Schedule Estimates, and Face Further Risks , GAO-07-357 (Washington, D.C.: February 28, 2007)\nAUDIT FINDINGS USAID\/Indonesia was managing the Aceh Road Reconstruction Project under its Tsunami Recovery and Reconstruction Program to minimize the risk of not completing the project on schedule and at planned cost. While USAID\/Indonesia faced many unforeseen difficulties during the start of the Aceh road project in a post-disaster environment, since about May 2006 the Mission significantly stepped up its actions to proactively identify, prioritize, and manage both internal and external factors that could impact on such risk. Nevertheless, these risk factorssome of which were beyond the Mission’s controlimpacted on the Aceh road project and caused delays.\n\nIn this event, all rights and obligations of the Client and the Tenderers previously related to the original date shall thereafter be subject to the amended date. Individual meetings or communications (except for requests for clarifications) by the Tenderers with the Client or the Recipient are not allowed. 4. Preparation of the Tender 4.1 The Tenderer should obtain for himself, on its own responsibility, all information, which may be necessary for preparing the Tender and entering into the Agreement. 4.2 The Client shall not be bound by any oral presentations whether by the Recipient or by others. 4.3 The Tender and all communication between the Tenderer and the contact point(s) as stated in section I of the Contract Notice shall be in the language as specified in section IV.3.6) of the Contract Notice. Supporting documentation submitted by the Tenderer may be in another language if he also submits an appropriate translation of all its relevant passages into this ruling language. 4.4 The Tender Documents to be submitted by each Tenderer shall comprise: (i) (ii) Letter of Tender including documentation as listed in the Letter of Tender Schedules of Tender Schedule 1, Comments to Appendix 1 Schedule 2, Description of Approach, Work Plan and Detailed Tasks, Reporting, Organization, outline QA Plan, and outline Business Integrity Management Plan Schedule 3, List of Key Personnel including brief CV s Schedule 4, Implementation Plan and Personnel Assignment Chart (iii) Schedule of Prices, as listed in Appendix 3\n6 Tender for Implementing partner for the development engagement Strengthening the Malian National Assembly. Page 6 of The Tender Dossier issued to the Tenderer, including any amendments instructed in an Addendum to Tender Dossier, shall be used without further changes. 4.6 The Tenderer shall also submit the supplementary documentation listed in the Letter of Tender. 4.7 All duties, taxes, VAT, and other levies applicable for the contract in question payable by the Consultant in relation to the performance of the Agreement, or for any other cause, shall be included in the rates, prices and total Tender Price submitted by the Tenderer, and the evaluation and comparison of Tenders by the Client shall be made accordingly. The duties, taxes, and other levies shall be those prevailing 28 days prior to the Tender Submission Deadline. It is the responsibility of the Tenderer to acquaint himself fully with the tax and excise laws in force in the Recipient Country prior to the submission of the Tender. 4.8 All prices and unit rates quoted in the Schedule of Prices shall be in Danish Kroner. 4.9 It is emphasized that the Client will not be able to engage in traditional negotiations with the Tenderers regarding the tenders submitted. With respect to negotiations, the Client will operate within the rules of negotiation set out, among others, in Council and Commission statement concerning Council Directive 93\/37\/EEC of 14 June 1993: \"The Council and the Commission state that in open and restricted procedures all negotiations with candidates or tenderers on fundamental aspects of contracts, variations in which are likely to distort competition, and in particular on prices, shall be ruled out; however, discussions with candidates or tenderers may be held but only for the purpose of clarifying or supplementing the content of their tenders of the requirements of the contracting authorities and provided this does not involve discrimination.\" Hence, no contract or price negotiations as such shall be conducted and, therefore, the Tenderers should ensure that the wording of their tenders allows the contract to be concluded without prior negotiations between the tenderer and the contracting authorities. It is thus of the utmost importance that the tenders are comprehensive and consider all relevant issues, contain all necessary information, and are precise in every respect. 5. Submission of the Tender 5.1 The Tenderer shall prepare one original set (technical- and price part), 2 copies, a PDF file and supplementary information, as described in these Instructions. Each such set shall be submitted in two inner envelopes within an outer envelope. One inner envelope shall include the Letter of Tender and the Technical Schedules and be marked \"Technical Part\" and the other shall include the Schedule of Prices and be marked \"Price Part\". The technical part shall be submitted in one original, 2 copies, and as PDF files, each not exceeding 5 MB, on one CD ROM \/ one USB Memory Stick, all in one envelope marked Technical Part.\n\nPart 2 – Technical\nThis article is part of the shortened content of a training course I held last year at our company for a number of trainees on how to write winning proposals for MATOC or IDIQ contracts. There are 10 parts to this training. In the previous article, we went over some common issues and general ideas about MATOC\/IDIQ contracts. From here on, we will explain each part of the proposal in detail. This article is about the Technical section of the proposal. Many RFPs require a technical section. Do not confuse this with the Technical Proposal vs Price Proposal that is usually required. The technical section is where you explain your solution with technical details and show its merit. Be it an IT project or a service\/maintenance or construction or training, all such projects usually require you to provide your solution in detail. I will take one step further and say: even if the RFP requirements don’t ask for it, go ahead and give the reviewer the information. He will understand that you know your business. This will make him more confident about your capabilities. Understanding the Requirements:\nI cannot emphasize more how important it is to fully understand the RFP requirements as a whole. When it comes to the technical part, it is so importance that can mean having a losing or a winning solution\/proposal. You need to read and reread, do research, get to your inside contacts if you have, ask questions from the contracting officer and use all other means to make sure that you have covered all areas of concern and are fully in sync with the mentality of the client. You need to ask yourself why are they putting out this RFP, what are their concerns, what have been the issues in previous executions of this contract – if it is a repeat – what are the client’s metrics, …\nTo do that, put yourself in the shoes of the government selection committee. First you need to understand what you want and what you are concerned about. Then you need to know what metric to use to select from the different solutions offered to you and how to assess them. Go through this mental practice. It will help you shape your proposal, it will help you put key explanations where they are needed to clear questions from the mind of the reader, and it will help you be in sync with the reader. Compliance with the Technical Requirements:\nThe proposal should address each work area in sufficient detail to demonstrate a clear understanding of the statement of work, including operations and maintenance problems presented therein, if any. Your proposal should provide evidence of sufficient planning to show that work will be accomplished as required and on schedule, utilizing all available resources. You need to demonstrate a firm understanding of the requirements and goals set forth in the scope of work, and address each separately. The best way to do this is to prepare a compliance matrix (chart), identifying client’s needs side by side with your solutions. Sometimes the RFP requires that matrix, but even if it doesn’t, you should include it. It will save a lot of work from the reviewer and he will be thankful of you because you have decreased his workload. Obviously each proposal has its own unique solution but a set of general guidelines can be derived:\n- Be Complete, Accurate and Persuasive\n- Identify the outcomes they’re looking to achieve\n- Recommend a solution that solves\/satisfies client’s needs, issues, and\/or concerns\n- Include the facilities, equipment, software, special expertise, methods used, and technologies on which your solution is based on\n- Identify the challenges and give solutions for the challenges\n- Present evidence that your team can deliver your solution on time and on budget (case studies)\n- Avoid marketing fluff, technical jargon, and outrageous claims. At the sametime, don’t just describe features of your solution; describe the benefits too. Forget about those who tell you that proposals should use minimum graphics. Pictures, drawings, charts, infographic and art work capture attention, and reduce the dullness of the pages of writing. Put yourself in the shoes of the reviewers. They read proposals often under less-than-ideal conditions, when they are very busy, in late hours, under pressure… like all of us. So you need to give them some spirit and cheer them up through your proposal; don’t make them more tired and bored. At the same time, don’t overdo yourself. Use maximum one graphic piece for each subject. Don’t be abstract, make it to the point.\n\nHowever, the most important thing to be aware of is how all the local pro-roadies link up to present a web of influence. This may be done by forming a formal group, along with local politicians. The Newbury Bypass Forum, for instance, manipulated local opinion effectively in 1995, presenting a vociferous political lobby to pressurise national government to approve the Newbury Bypass. The most important links will be behind the scenes - local businesses, landowners and politicians all have their hands in each others' pockets. Expose the vested interests! Contract Award Procedures\nFirstly, the contract will usually be advertised by the roadbuilding agency in the trade press, inviting contractors to \"pre-qualify\" for the contract. This means demonstrating their ability and credentials to successfully complete the contract. This stage is sometimes omitted for preliminary contracts. The roadbuilding agency will then select a shortlist of contractors (often six) who will be invited to submit bids. These contractors will prepare a detailed price estimate of their costs in completing the contract. This represents a significant investment of time and money by each contractor, who must submit their bid (or \"tender\") by a certain date stated by the roadbuilding agency. The agency will then work through the bids, eliminating them until it awards the contract - often to the lowest bidder. The construction press will have the latest news on contracts, including which contractors have been shortlisted, and rumours about who is most likely to win. The roadbuilding agency will make an official announcement when it's ready, but the contract will have been sewn up before then. Once a main contract has been signed, stopping the road becomes very much harder. We suggest putting a lot of energy and thought into sabotaging the contract award procedures (see ideas within Chapter 10). A Note About Dbfo & Private Finance\nNew publicly-funded trunk roads are currently rare in Britain, and private finance is becoming more important. In many other parts of the world, it is the usual means of funding infrastructure. We mention it here because private finance procedures may vary from those described above. In particular, the UK system of DBFO (Design, Build, Finance, Operate) is very different; bidders must form a consortium, comprising civil engineers, consulting engineers, financiers, traffic consultants, and legal advisers, to bid for a contract. The contract involves some new scheme planning and construction, but also maintenance of a stretch of highway for some years, all at the consortium's own cost. At the end of this time, the consortium will be reimbursed by the Treasury according to a number of factors, including traffic levels - a reward for generated traffic! The main difference with a DBFO contract is its greater scope and complexity, and a higher burden of risk on contractors. If the road you're fighting is DBFO or private finance, we suggest exploiting all the extra issues raised. For background info on DBFOs contact Transport 2000 or ALARM UK (see Chapter 16). Chapter 8 - Preparing for Action\nWhen considering Nonviolent Direct Action (NVDA), and particularly as the start of work looms, there are lots of things you can do to set up a framework for sustained action. The further in advance you start, the more comprehensive your preparation will be. The contractors won't phone up to let you know when they are coming, so it is important to regularly visit the route or area under threat and get to know it intimately. Note all sightings of suspicious-looking people or vehicles. Start a list of contractor's vehicles, any telephone numbers on them, and their number plates. Cameras may be useful for identifying key contractor's staff. Don't feel afraid to approach them. Try to find out where they come from. Ask them politely what they are doing, but remember they may well lie. If they are contractors or surveyors, let them know that they are not welcome, perhaps chase them off or obstruct them. It may be best to watch surveyors without approaching them (see Chapter 10). A co-ordinated route monitoring rota prevents duplication of effort. If monitoring is only done once each day, it shouldn't be too early as contractors could arrive at any time. Strategically placed people with binoculars and a good view of approach roads, paths and car parks, should spot any unwanted activity. Ask dog walkers and other locals (especially those living very near the route) to look out for and report anything unusual.\n\nEU solidarity with Ukraine\nProzorro+: Ukrainian public procurement platform\nMalawi-Lilongwe: General public services\nProcurement award procedure applying to European Union external actions financed from NDICI Global Europe.

Entebbe Road leads to Uganda’s only international airport, and is one of the country’s busiest roads. The road links Wakiso District to Kibuye in Kampala to Mpala, Entebbe - passing through Kibuye, Kajjansi, and Abayita Ababiri before ending at the airport, a total distance of about 40 kilometres. Before the opening of the Entebbe–Kampala Expressway, the Entebbe road was the only direct link between Kampala and the international airport. The road is a single carriageway, and is narrow and congested with a heavy volume of traffic on the road. Because of the congestion, it is one of the most accident-prone roads in the country. Traffic on this road had reduced substantially after the completion of the Kampala-Entebbe Expressway in 2018, as many motorists resorted to using the expressway as an alternative route to avoid traffic congestion on the existing Kampala-Entebbe road. However, traffic on the road has since increased following the government implementation of toll payments on the Kampala-Entebbe Expressway in January this year (2022). Experience the impeccable road stretch away from the hustle of the city, as you drive past magnificent nature with fresh air kicking in across every bend. Experience the Kampala- Entebbe Expressway in all its glory. #KEEUG #ExploreUganda pic.twitter.com\/Sub1dt5NuL— Kampala Entebbe Expressway (@KEE_UG) March 29, 2022\nLast year, the Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) awarded a contract for the rehabilitation of a 22 kilometres stretch of the Entebbe road from Mpala, Entebbe in Wakiso District to Kibuye in Kampala. UNRA is the Ugandan government agency responsible for developing and maintaining the country's national roads network and advise the government on general road policies and national transport concerns. The contract for the rehabilitation of the 22 kilometre road stretch from Entebbe to Kibuye was awarded to the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), at a cost of US$12 million. The scope of the rehabilitation works includes the restoration of existing sidewalks, the construction of drainage channels to avoid flooding, in particular around the Kajjansi region, and the installation of street lights. Construction works commenced on the rehabilitation of the road sometime in August \/ September 2021. At the end of March this year (2022), the CCCC site engineer on the project, Mr Guo Zitong, stated that the project was 50% complete and would be completed within five months, i.e. in August this year (2022). This is according to a news article posted on the website of the Daily Monitor, a Ugandan newspaper. The Daily Monitor article also reported that the UNRA media relations manager, Mr Allan Ssempebwa, said that the road rehabilitation works in the section between Mpala and Kisubi in Wakiso district included stone pitching of side drains to aid the adequate flow of stormwater, shoulder repair, major full road width repairs, and installation of access culverts as well as access road construction to reduce silt damage on main pavements. Ssempebwa further explained that “Particular attention will be given to some sections, especially those prone to floodings, such as Lubowa, Zzana and Namasuba. For instance, the Bata-Bata area will be fixed with proper drainage systems”. Also speaking on the Entebbe-Kibuye road rehabilitation, Mr Francis Ojok, speaking on behalf of the officer in charge of Traffic in the Kajjansi area, emphasized the importance of the roadworks to free up traffic issues in the area. The introduction of pedestrian walkways will also help reduce the number of traffic accidents. Currently, traffic management is difficult due to the blocking of part of the roadway to aid the construction work. Assistant Superintendent of Police, Luke Nuwataho, also commented that the Kajjansi area has been experiencing flooding which should be resolved by the road works.

This is the first-ever toll road in the country and was developed by the Uganda National Road Authority\nThe consultation for this billion project between the Government of Uganda and China began in 2009. It was meant to improve traffic conditions and mitigate the congestion on the bypass and the distributor roads in urban areas. Its routes and Design details\nThis infrastructure has two lanes in each direction and two road sections (36.94km long section and 12.68km long link road). The speed limit on this road ranges between 50km\/ -100km\/h. Its 36.94km long section is divided into two parts whereby the first 24.9km stretch of the sections starts at a point on the Kampala Northern Bypass and runs along the new route before ending at Abayita ababiri. The 12.04km section starts at the Interchange (Abayita ababiri) and winds along the existing Kampala-Entebbe road. 7.4km of it was widened and 4.64km upgraded to the latest standards. Apart from that, its 12.68km long roads originate from the highway at Kajjansi interchange and continue eastwards up to Munyonyo. Bridges and Interchanges on the Expressway\nAdding to the four interchanges at Kajjansi, Busega, Lweza and Mpala, this expressway features nineteen over-bridges and eighteen underpasses that provide access to other areas around. Besides that, three main toll plazas were built on the expressway at Mpala, Kajjansi and Busega. Mpala and Kajjansi toll plazas have five gates. The Busega toll plaza differs itself unique with six toll gates. Moreover, two suspension bridges that measure 200m and 500m by length were put up over the Lubiji swamp in Busega and Kyengera. Its highway includes a 75m long bridge at Kajjansi and the 1.45m long suspension bridge over Nambigirwa swamp. The 240 pillars that support Nambigirwa swamp have a lifespan of 100 years and were installed to a depth of 55m. The Main Contractors\nUNRA awarded the design-build contract to China Communication Construction Company in October 2010. Then in May 2012, Beijing Expressway Supervision was selected as the consulting engineer for the supervision of the design and construction of this road. The site project management, investigations and laboratory tests, and geotechnical survey services for the expressway were provided between January 2012 and 2013 by the Ugandan consulting firm Project Management and Engineering. Thereafter UNRA engaged the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank as the transaction adviser for this project. The IFC then contracted IMC Worldwide and Vetiver Associates to provide preliminary assessment for the toll road\nFinancing for the Project\nIt was jointly funded by the government of Uganda and the Exim Bank of China. Of $476 m for the project, Uganda contributed only USD 126m and the remaining part of USD350m came from the pockets of China Exim Bank but given as a preferential buyer credit loan. The agreement was signed by GoU in May 2011. This loan is to be paid back in a period of 40 years by the government through collecting taxes from its citizens. More to be paid is the USD 40m used for compensation to the landowners who were vacated from areas where the expressway passed. What are the Benefits of this toll road? The main aim of this world-class carriageway was to ease traffic congestion on main roads in Kampala city and its suburbs. Uganda’s road traffic is growing at an estimated rate of 4.5 per cent per year. This is due to the increased number of vehicles in Kampala and other cities. This path will also reduce the travel time from Kampala to Entebbe or vice versor. It takes about 30 minutes. This is time-saving when compared to 120 minutes for someone who is using the old Kampala – Entebbe road.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:3b66253e-2ea9-4432-b47a-e0fa41fb3aca>"]},{"passage":"In this series we are doing a deep dive into the sourcing process today, and, in particular discussing what is involved, what is typically done (manually), and whether or not it should be that way. We have already completed our initial discussion of the initial project request review phase, the follow up needs assessment, the strategy selection phase, the communication phase, the analysis phase, and the negotiations phase. Now we are in the final contracting phase. At first glance, it looks like this is the second most strategic and human-driven phase there is, second only to negotiation, as it is humans (and lawyers in particular) who typically define standard terms and conditions, humans who identify risk and mitigation strategies, humans who define obligations, and humans who analyze the contract for compliance to goals. But is this the case? So in this final step, the contract step, we have these final sub-steps:\n- Standard Terms and Conditions\n- Modification & Risk Mitigation to Supplier & Country\n- Key Metadata definition and obligation specification\n- Contract Analytics\nIf all of the standard terms and conditions are in existing contracts and the contract clause \/ template repository, there’s no reason that a system cannot automatically scan the contracts and repositories, identify the standard organizational terms in every contract, identify the standard terms for the category, and identify any terms, often not included, that would be relevant to the category. Probabilities can be applied and contract terms organized by weight. The buyer can then just bulk select or bulk reject the relevant clauses. In the modification and risk mitigation step, a contract analytics engine can be applied to determine how well a particular clause addresses a certain risk of relevance to the organization based on context models and differentials. It can then compare that clause to the clauses that best address the risk and identify the necessary modifications, and do so specifically from a supplier or geographic context. In the key metadata definition and obligation specification step, the goal is to identify the right metadata that needs to be tracked against the contract. This will be dependent on the terms and conditions, the goals, the obligations, and other key information that will be specific to the contract. However, contract analytics can identify, or at least suggest, much of this as well automatically based upon similar contracts, similar terms, similar goals, and similar obligations. This can greatly reduce the effort required by a buyer. In the final step, the contract analytics step, the identification of risks, variances from a norm, and non-standard clauses can often be better identified by a contracts analytics engine that can cross-compare potentially risky clauses and variant clauses across hundreds, if not thousands, of contracts and identify deviations from the norm. A user just has to decide whether the variance is enough to be of interest to them, and properly setting a threshold can eliminate the majority of those variances that are not. In other words, at the end of the day, contract analytics identifies the majority of standard terms and conditions that are of interest, the majority of standard clauses that will need modifications to address supplier and country risk, the relevant metadata and obligations associated with the contract, and any clauses that can be considered variant enough to warrant special consideration. The majority of the work can be automated with a good contract analytics engine — the role of the buyer is to apply their intelligence to determine how accurate and effective it is. As the buyer trains the engine, it will become more and more accurate over time and the strategic work will be reduced to hours, sometimes minutes for simple contracts, compared to days or weeks. In other words, the more we explore the sourcing process, the more we find out how truly tactical, or at least automatable, the majority of it is.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:8899ebdb-4b4f-4846-b11d-77935a9c0381>"]},{"passage":"This agreement (in conjunction with the trade agreement) contains all understanding and agreement between the parties as to the purpose of this agreement and replaces all agreements, documents, projections, financial data, statements and advance guarantees, orally orally, explicit or implied, between the parties concerned and their related companies, representatives and agents concerned with respect to the purpose of this agreement. the offer or terms and conditions that brought the parties together. This is the “meat” of the contract, and perhaps the one that your lawyer will offer most of the instructions until you get the ride. But people rarely go wrong when they are too specific; it is the lack of essential details or uncertainty that can cause problems. If you enter into a z.B business contract to sell your office copier, you must provide details such as a description of the equipment, sale price, terms of sale and date of transaction. There are six essential elements necessary for a contract to be valid (enforceable through the courts). The first three, which are considered together, refer to the agreement itself and the other three relate to the parties who enter into the contract. Contractual guarantees are less important conditions and are not fundamental to the agreement. They cannot terminate a contract if the guarantees are not fulfilled, but they can claim damages for the losses incurred. While these are some of the most common legal agreements you might see in an economic context, they can cover an almost infinite number of topics as long as the elements are in place and are not prohibited by law. And while some contracts may not need to be written, ALWAYS is a better idea to do so. Both parties must be “reasonable” to understand the seriousness of the situation and understand what is necessary. This definition requires that neither party be minor, both must be sober (not under the influence of drugs or alcohol when signing the contract) and no rehabilitation can be mentally deficient. If a party is not competent, the contract is not valid and the unmarried party may refuse (ignore) the contract. Contract management is part of running a small business. They will have a number of business relationships that involve some kind of contractual obligation or obligation. Don`t waste time negotiating a commercial contract with someone who doesn`t have the power to make a binding decision. It should be in the person`s best interest to ensure that you are complying with the obligations of the agreement. Legality should be the simplest part of the contract. This means that the terms and conditions must be legal; If not, the contract is not valid. For example, the sale of a photocopier is legal; Breaking into a closed store in the middle of the night, stealing a photocopier and selling it on an online shopping site is not the case. Each contract must include a specific offer and acceptance of that specific offer. Both parties must accept their free will. Neither party can be forced or forced to sign the contract and both parties must agree to the same conditions. These three conditions imply the intention of the parties to create a binding agreement. If one or both parties are not serious, there is no contract. TIP: If it is not possible to have a written contract, make sure you have other documentation such as emails, offers or notes of your discussions to help you identify what has been agreed. Contractual terms are fundamental to the agreement.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:79a7e0c1-cff7-4f07-a94d-3b146e12d13d>"]},{"passage":"There may always be instances where the contract will be in question, especially if there’s a third party that may cause a burden. For instance, if you have a contract to buy a house but amid the transaction, a hurricane comes by and destroys it, what would it entail? Would the buyer still need to purchase it with the same amount or would it be less? You would also need to indicate what each party should and should not do. 4. Make sure to elaborate on the terms and conditions in the contract. Be specific and layout all the exact terms to avoid confusion, especially if this agreement affects a whole organization or future leaders. If there are damages or liabilities which the opposite party accepts, this too should be included in the terms. 5. Of course, all contracts can also end as agreed by both parties so it is also advisable to add a termination clause. This clause states all the legal ways of removing one party or both parties from such agreement without breach. This is most essential for long term contacts. 6. Never forget to sign and notarize. Make a contract legal by obtaining the signature of both parties which also means naming it after those involved. Having it notarized is also essential as it will make the contract a public instrument and can be used in court. It means nothing if the offer is accepted but has no written proof. If there should be changes, negotiation should be done and altered in the contract. 7. Lastly, make sure that all things agreed are legal and binding. Consider the age of the people involved, the nature of the industry and if the agreement was made in good faith. Any fraudulent transactions or threats can void the contract. Format of a contract\nThere’s no definite format for contracts since its content can go long or short, depending on the agreement. The essential elements that need to be found on a contract though can be summed up in this sample which elaborates on the parts of a client-vendor contract. This is a short description of the two parties who are in agreement, the sum of the project, duration of the project or date, and the monetary value or cost of the agreement. Provide information about the agreement that includes the job, duties, responsibilities, and promises of the vendor and the client. If there are payment terms involved, this will be considered a responsibility for the client. 3. Scope of work\nThis part elaborates on the deliverables of the vendor. If there is a budget involved, explain in detail what they get in return. Explain the inclusions, freebies (if any), limitations and any process that should be observed. Indicate how a situation be managed when things don’t go as planned. May it be changes, challenges, “acts of God” such as interventions from nature, or anything affecting the agreement to change. Place the additional fees or workload that should be included if there are any. 5. Rights of clients and vendors\nIf this was a product such as music, graphic design or photos, copyright ownerships can be elaborated in the contract. You can indicate the limitations of where it can or cannot be used, you can also explain if the work is completely turned over to the client or if a non-editable work is only given. If you don’t want this work to be used in billboards, you can also limit the ownership to digital use. As long as it was agreed, it can be placed on the contract. This is often optional for small online businesses or freelancers but for big companies, this is a must. Explain the duration of which your company is willing to fix\/return or exchange the product or service. It is recommended though that the date be specific rather than placing a number of days in the contract to avoid loopholes. Of course, if the warranty is over, the question still is what happens next? What should the client pay for your company to fix things after the expiration of the warranty? 7. Fees and payment method\nWill the payment be paid in full once the work is done? Is there a 50% down payment required before the project is started? Will there be a monthly fee or additional fee when plans change? How would the timeline look like? These are the common questions that you should ask yourself when drafting this section. If you can, it is best to assign an amount for every milestone reached, especially if the payment terms are in staggered payment terms. Not all partnerships and client-vendor relationships work. If there is a need to cancel the contract, this section should indicate what are valid premises, the conditions and what should be done to cancel the whole agreement. 9.

USAID\/Indonesia originally planned on awarding this contract in September 2006 to complete the remaining road construction, including bridges and culverts. However, this was delayed because the Mission and prospective contractor did not reach agreement on price. In October 2006, the Mission began a new solicitation process and the contract was awarded in June 2007. The project was scheduled to be completed by February 2010. 1 A Strategic Objective Agreement is the principal bilateral grant agreement used by USAID with a foreign government or a subdivision of it. Although USAID\/Indonesia originally committed to reconstruct the entire 243 km roadway between Banda Aceh and Meulaboh, the Government of Japan through its Japan International Cooperation System (JICS) was already rehabilitating the existing road from Calang to Meulaboh. In June 2006, USAID\/Indonesia, JICS, and the GOI reached an agreement that there would be a single route for the entire roadway between Banda Aceh and Meulaboh, and that JICS would continue its road work from Calang to Meulaboh. As a result, USAID\/Indonesia reduced its original project scope to about 144 km from 243 km, which included building two bypasses in the JICS road segment. Figure 1 shows a map of the Aceh road project, including the JICS segment.

In its report, GAO concluded that USAID\/Indonesia faced increased risk that it may not successfully complete the project at planned cost and on schedule because of factors typically related to the difficulty of operating in a post-disaster environment, such as increased construction costs and delays in land acquisition. 3 As a result, USAID\/Indonesia did realize an increase in costs above the original government estimate. As of March 31, 2007, the total budget for the Aceh road project was estimated to cost $253 million, of which USAID\/Indonesia had obligated about $103 million and disbursed $18 million for Aceh road project activities.

While USAID\/Indonesia faced many unforeseen difficulties during the start of the Aceh road project in a post-disaster environment, since about May 2006 the Mission significantly stepped up its actions to proactively identify, prioritize, and manage both internal and external factors that could impact on such risk.

There are 10 parts to this training. In the previous article, we went over some common issues and general ideas about MATOC\/IDIQ contracts. From here on, we will explain each part of the proposal in detail. This article is about the Technical section of the proposal. Many RFPs require a technical section. Do not confuse this with the Technical Proposal vs Price Proposal that is usually required. The technical section is where you explain your solution with technical details and show its merit. Be it an IT project or a service\/maintenance or construction or training, all such projects usually require you to provide your solution in detail. I will take one step further and say: even if the RFP requirements don’t ask for it, go ahead and give the reviewer the information. He will understand that you know your business. This will make him more confident about your capabilities. Understanding the Requirements:\nI cannot emphasize more how important it is to fully understand the RFP requirements as a whole. When it comes to the technical part, it is so importance that can mean having a losing or a winning solution\/proposal. You need to read and reread, do research, get to your inside contacts if you have, ask questions from the contracting officer and use all other means to make sure that you have covered all areas of concern and are fully in sync with the mentality of the client. You need to ask yourself why are they putting out this RFP, what are their concerns, what have been the issues in previous executions of this contract – if it is a repeat – what are the client’s metrics, …\nTo do that, put yourself in the shoes of the government selection committee. First you need to understand what you want and what you are concerned about. Then you need to know what metric to use to select from the different solutions offered to you and how to assess them. Go through this mental practice. It will help you shape your proposal, it will help you put key explanations where they are needed to clear questions from the mind of the reader, and it will help you be in sync with the reader. Compliance with the Technical Requirements:\nThe proposal should address each work area in sufficient detail to demonstrate a clear understanding of the statement of work, including operations and maintenance problems presented therein, if any. Your proposal should provide evidence of sufficient planning to show that work will be accomplished as required and on schedule, utilizing all available resources. You need to demonstrate a firm understanding of the requirements and goals set forth in the scope of work, and address each separately. The best way to do this is to prepare a compliance matrix (chart), identifying client’s needs side by side with your solutions. Sometimes the RFP requires that matrix, but even if it doesn’t, you should include it. It will save a lot of work from the reviewer and he will be thankful of you because you have decreased his workload. Obviously each proposal has its own unique solution but a set of general guidelines can be derived:\n- Be Complete, Accurate and Persuasive\n- Identify the outcomes they’re looking to achieve\n- Recommend a solution that solves\/satisfies client’s needs, issues, and\/or concerns\n- Include the facilities, equipment, software, special expertise, methods used, and technologies on which your solution is based on\n- Identify the challenges and give solutions for the challenges\n- Present evidence that your team can deliver your solution on time and on budget (case studies)\n- Avoid marketing fluff, technical jargon, and outrageous claims. At the sametime, don’t just describe features of your solution; describe the benefits too. Forget about those who tell you that proposals should use minimum graphics. Pictures, drawings, charts, infographic and art work capture attention, and reduce the dullness of the pages of writing. Put yourself in the shoes of the reviewers. They read proposals often under less-than-ideal conditions, when they are very busy, in late hours, under pressure… like all of us. So you need to give them some spirit and cheer them up through your proposal; don’t make them more tired and bored. At the same time, don’t overdo yourself. Use maximum one graphic piece for each subject. Don’t be abstract, make it to the point.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:f0d2b143-4e28-4476-bca4-4ae10c04bc70>"]},{"passage":"However, the most important thing to be aware of is how all the local pro-roadies link up to present a web of influence. This may be done by forming a formal group, along with local politicians. The Newbury Bypass Forum, for instance, manipulated local opinion effectively in 1995, presenting a vociferous political lobby to pressurise national government to approve the Newbury Bypass. The most important links will be behind the scenes - local businesses, landowners and politicians all have their hands in each others' pockets. Expose the vested interests! Contract Award Procedures\nFirstly, the contract will usually be advertised by the roadbuilding agency in the trade press, inviting contractors to \"pre-qualify\" for the contract. This means demonstrating their ability and credentials to successfully complete the contract. This stage is sometimes omitted for preliminary contracts. The roadbuilding agency will then select a shortlist of contractors (often six) who will be invited to submit bids. These contractors will prepare a detailed price estimate of their costs in completing the contract. This represents a significant investment of time and money by each contractor, who must submit their bid (or \"tender\") by a certain date stated by the roadbuilding agency. The agency will then work through the bids, eliminating them until it awards the contract - often to the lowest bidder. The construction press will have the latest news on contracts, including which contractors have been shortlisted, and rumours about who is most likely to win. The roadbuilding agency will make an official announcement when it's ready, but the contract will have been sewn up before then. Once a main contract has been signed, stopping the road becomes very much harder. We suggest putting a lot of energy and thought into sabotaging the contract award procedures (see ideas within Chapter 10). A Note About Dbfo & Private Finance\nNew publicly-funded trunk roads are currently rare in Britain, and private finance is becoming more important. In many other parts of the world, it is the usual means of funding infrastructure. We mention it here because private finance procedures may vary from those described above. In particular, the UK system of DBFO (Design, Build, Finance, Operate) is very different; bidders must form a consortium, comprising civil engineers, consulting engineers, financiers, traffic consultants, and legal advisers, to bid for a contract. The contract involves some new scheme planning and construction, but also maintenance of a stretch of highway for some years, all at the consortium's own cost. At the end of this time, the consortium will be reimbursed by the Treasury according to a number of factors, including traffic levels - a reward for generated traffic! The main difference with a DBFO contract is its greater scope and complexity, and a higher burden of risk on contractors. If the road you're fighting is DBFO or private finance, we suggest exploiting all the extra issues raised. For background info on DBFOs contact Transport 2000 or ALARM UK (see Chapter 16). Chapter 8 - Preparing for Action\nWhen considering Nonviolent Direct Action (NVDA), and particularly as the start of work looms, there are lots of things you can do to set up a framework for sustained action. The further in advance you start, the more comprehensive your preparation will be. The contractors won't phone up to let you know when they are coming, so it is important to regularly visit the route or area under threat and get to know it intimately. Note all sightings of suspicious-looking people or vehicles. Start a list of contractor's vehicles, any telephone numbers on them, and their number plates. Cameras may be useful for identifying key contractor's staff. Don't feel afraid to approach them. Try to find out where they come from. Ask them politely what they are doing, but remember they may well lie. If they are contractors or surveyors, let them know that they are not welcome, perhaps chase them off or obstruct them. It may be best to watch surveyors without approaching them (see Chapter 10). A co-ordinated route monitoring rota prevents duplication of effort. If monitoring is only done once each day, it shouldn't be too early as contractors could arrive at any time. Strategically placed people with binoculars and a good view of approach roads, paths and car parks, should spot any unwanted activity. Ask dog walkers and other locals (especially those living very near the route) to look out for and report anything unusual.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:1fd5ac91-5f1a-4522-9e0e-df7c31a46361>"]},{"passage":"EU solidarity with Ukraine\nProzorro+: Ukrainian public procurement platform\nMalawi-Lilongwe: General public services\nProcurement award procedure applying to European Union external actions financed from NDICI Global Europe.

A corporation is a business entity that is owned by its shareholder(s), who elect a board of directors to oversee the organization’s activities. The corporation is liable for the actions and finances of the business – the shareholders are not. Corporations can be for-profit, as businesses are, or not-for-profit, as charitable organizations typically are. Types of Corporations There are two major types of corporations as well: Subchapter C corporations, which are larger organizations owned by multiple shareholders, which can also be other businesses, and Subchapter S corporations, which are often (but not always) smaller businesses owned by an individual shareholder. Before creating a corporation, consider what you hope to gain from establishing this separate entity. The biggest advantages of having a corporation are: - As with some other types of businesses, corporations provide liability protection for its owners, who are called shareholders. - Companies hoping to raise money from investors will have an easier time as a corporation, which can sell ownership shares. - Corporate profits are taxed, but at a lower rate than the personal income tax rate individuals pay. - Potential employees may find working for a corporation, with the prospect of ownership benefits, to be more appealing than working for a privately-held company. - The corporation can offer a medical reimbursement plan, deducting the cost of providing insurance to employees while allowing employees to use the benefit tax-free. While corporations can certainly shield owners from liability, the downsides are sizeable and very costly: - C Corporations are complex and expensive to set up. - Once established, corporations spend significant sums of money to stay on top of changing business regulations and timely filing of paperwork. They are best for large organizations with many employees. - Corporations pay federal, state, and sometimes local taxes on profits, unlike LLCs. - The corporation pays taxes on dividends paid to shareholders, who then pay taxes on that income themselves. Forming a Corporation Corporations are often formed in the state in which the business operates, but it doesn’t have to be. Some corporations are formed in states thought to be pro-business, such as Delaware or Nevada, although that creates extra paperwork. You then need to register the corporation as a foreign entity in the state in which you are doing business, and pay taxes to that state. The next step is creating Articles of Incorporation, which are filed with the state in which you have registered the corporation. These include: - The name and physical address of the business. - A description of the business and its goods and services. - The name and address of the registered agent, or the person authorized to receive official notices. - A count of the number of shares issued and to whom. And then create by-laws, which are the rules of the corporation. They include, at a minimum: - How often the board of directors meets, and when. - Whether the business operates on a calendar or fiscal year. - How long board members can serve. - Rules for changing by-laws. By-laws can be amended as needed once the corporation is formed. If you expect at some point in the near future to take your company public through an initial public offering (IPO), a C corporation may make a lot of sense.","question_category":"first turn question; Natural","question_category_desc":"the initial question of a conversation, and therefore self-contained and understandable, without any other context.; phrased in the way people typically speak, reflecting everyday language use, without formal or artificial structure.","user_category":"Expert","user_category_desc":"A specialized user with deep understanding of the corpus.","question":"What are the key tax implications for corporations compared to other business structures?","gold":"Corporations face distinct tax implications: they pay federal, state, and sometimes local taxes on profits, unlike LLCs. Additionally, there's a double taxation situation where the corporation pays taxes on dividends paid to shareholders, and then shareholders must pay taxes on that income themselves. However, corporate profits are taxed at a lower rate than the personal income tax rate individuals pay.","answer":"\\boxed{The key tax implications for corporations, particularly C corporations, compared to other business structures include the potential for double taxation. This means that corporate profits are taxed at the corporate level, and then again when distributed to shareholders as dividends, who are taxed on this income. This double taxation can be a significant financial burden for C corporations.\n\nIn contrast, other business structures such as S corporations, partnerships, and limited liability companies (LLCs) typically avoid double taxation. These entities are often referred to as \"pass-through\" entities, meaning that the business profits and losses are passed through to the owners, who then report this income on their individual tax returns. This single layer of taxation can be more advantageous for small business owners who want to minimize their tax liabilities.\n\nS corporations, for instance, are subject to pass-through taxation, allowing their profits and losses to be allocated to shareholders who report them on their personal tax returns. However, to qualify for this tax treatment, S corporations must adhere to specific IRS regulations, including limitations on the number of shareholders and types of shareholders allowed.\n\nPartnerships and LLCs also benefit from pass-through taxation, enabling business income and losses to be reported on the partners' or members' individual tax returns. This structure offers flexibility in how income and losses are distributed among owners, which can be beneficial for tax planning purposes.\n\nIn summary, the primary tax implication for corporations, especially C corporations, is the risk of double taxation, whereas other business structures like S corporations, partnerships, and LLCs typically avoid this through pass-through taxation, providing a more straightforward and potentially less costly tax situation for the business owners.}","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: When conceptualizing a new venture, this decision is seldom given the thought and consideration it deserves. Start your business the right way by addressing this first. By Michael F. O'Keefe\nWHETHER SETTING UP YOUR BUSINESS as a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company (LLC), S-Corporation, or C-Corporation, it is vital to understand, not only the filing and paperwork requirements, but also the different tax implications that are present with each type of business structure. Commonly, owner-operated small businesses are set up as sole proprietorships due to the simplicity of the filings and regulation, as well as the single-layer tax impact on the revenues of the business. This type of ownership also allows the owner to be his or her own boss. However, owners should be extremely cautious when dealing as a sole proprietor or in a general partnership. These two types of business structures allow for all of the liabilities of the business to be shared with the individual owners on a personal level. As such, unlimited liability can be scary. Just remember to hope for the best but plan for the worst. Don’t choose a business structure based on the ease and convenience of setting it up. It is more common than one would think to have business situations end in lawsuits resulting in general partners and sole proprietors being sued personally and losing homes, cars and savings accounts. There are plenty of hurdles that these types of business owners have to overcome. Management can be difficult with limited participants and there is commonly a very overwhelming time commitment associated with this type of business. There are two types of members in a partnership: a general partner and a limited partner. General partners have unlimited liability and they are typically managers of the company. Limited partners have exactly what you would think: limited liability. They, also, usually do not have a role managing the company. Just remember, no matter how well the individual partners get along, one of the most common issues with partnerships is the disagreements that arise between members. This sometimes leads to unfortunate falling-outs between friends. Most successful types of businesses are corporations—either limited liability companies, conventional corporations (C-Corps), or S-Corporations. These three forms of business ownership comprise approximately 80% of all sales in the United States and they all share two major benefits; the first being that they have limited liability, and the second, they usually qualify for special tax advantages that other types of business ownerships do not. Incorporating a business is a great strategy as it allows for the company to grow, it has perpetual life, ownership can change hands easily, and it’s common for corporations to be able to afford talented employees. However, as a sword can cut both ways, there are some disadvantages to incorporating a business. Corporations are more costly to start, they require more paperwork, possible conflicts with other owners and board members can arise, and they are also affected by double taxation, which means that the business’ profits will be taxed, as well as the shareholders’ dividends. A special type of incorporation is called an S-Corporation. Aside from sharing the benefit of limited liability, this type of corporation has a major difference from a conventional C-Corporation: It has much simpler taxes, called ‘single taxation,’ that are similar to that of a partnership. Downsides of incorporating as an S-Corporation include ineligibility for a dividends received deduction, and that S-Corps are not subject to the 10% of taxable income limitation that are applicable to charitable contribution deductions. Choosing the best type of business is a personal choice, albeit one that shouldn’t be taken lightly. The prospected longevity, growth and future development of the business should be taken into serious consideration before the choice to incorporate is made.\n\nWhen it comes to setting up corporate structures there are a variety of considerations to bear in mind. There are both commercial and tax implications that need to be considered. The adage that the tax tail should not wag the commercial dog is very true in these situations. However, one of the main commercial considerations in determining the best structure for the business is actually to consider the tax implications, as they will have a big impact on the financials for the business. Setting up a Limited company:\nA Limited company structure provides important protection due to the \"limited liability\" characteristic of companies. By being a Limited liability company it means that the shareholders are protected from loss of their own personal assets. Another advantage of Limited company status is the current favourable taxation treatment of companies compared with sole traders\/individuals. Some problems inherent with a Limited liability structure include that the structure is rather rigid in that incoming or exiting shareholders will have various implications for the business - and there will be taxation implications on the disposal of shares or \"company buy back\" of shares. Limited Liability Partnerships:\nLimited liability partnerships allow for greater flexibility in that profits sharing ratios can be changed dependant on private agreements of the Partners. The main constituational document of the partnership will be the partnership agreement. This will control the way in which the partnership interacts and behaves with its members and the way in which business is conducted by the partnership. An LLP is tax transparent and therefore the taxation of the profits of the partnership fall onto the \"members\" of the LLP. There are a variety of benefits in setting up a corporate group structure - either at the inception of the business or at a future point in time. We have advised many clients on the benefits of setting up a corporate structure such that they can benefit from important tax reliefs such as Substantial Shareholders' exemption on a disposal of part of the business. It is important to liaise with us in advance of making any important decisions as there will often be certain ways of carrying out transactions that will be more beneficial from a taxation perspective. Please contact your usual MG Group contact if you would like to find out more about the options available in setting up a business structure and to determine what the advantages and disadvantages are from each type of business structure.\n\nAs a small business owner, it's important to understand the tax implications of your business decisions. Failing to comply with tax laws can result in penalties and fines, so it's essential to stay informed about the tax considerations that apply to your business. In this blog post, we will explore some of the key tax considerations that small businesses need to be aware of. The type of business structure you choose, such as sole proprietorship, partnership, LLC or corporation, will affect how your business is taxed. It's essential to understand the tax implications of each business structure and choose the one that best suits your needs. Small businesses can claim deductions for various business expenses, such as office rent, employee salaries, office supplies, and more. Be sure to keep accurate records and receipts of your business expenses to maximize your deductions. Depending on the type of business you run, you may be required to collect sales taxes from customers and remit them to the government. It's important to understand the sales tax laws that apply to your business and to stay current with changes in the tax code. Self-employed individuals and small business owners are often required to pay estimated taxes throughout the year. It's important to understand the rules for estimated taxes and to make timely payments to avoid penalties. As an employer, you are responsible for withholding taxes from your employees' paychecks and remitting them to the government. You must also file the necessary forms with the government to report the taxes you have withheld. Small business owners can take advantage of retirement plans, such as a solo 401(k) or a Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRA, to save for retirement and reduce their tax liabilities. If you do business in multiple countries, you may be subject to international tax laws and regulations. A business attorney or a tax expert can advise you on your international tax obligations.

That shift has reduced federal revenues but probably promoted overall investment and a more efficient allocation of resources. Most business receipts—the revenues that businesses receive from sales of goods and services—come from a relatively small number of firms subject to the corporate income tax, called C corporations. However, other organizational forms allow businesses to avoid the corporate tax by passing their profits through to their owners, where they are subject to the individual income tax. Use of those pass-through structures has grown: In 1980, 83 percent of firms passed profits through to their owners for taxation, and they accounted for 14 percent of business receipts; by 2007, those shares had increased to 94 percent and 38 percent, respectively. Organizational forms that provide owners with the same protection from liability for the debts of the firm that the owners of C corporations receive were almost entirely responsible for that growth. Today’s CBO report Taxing Businesses Through the Individual Income Tax examines the size and causes of the shift in organizational structure, the effect it has had on federal revenues, and the potential effects on revenues and investment of various alternative approaches to taxing businesses’ profits. The report examines three potential approaches to the taxation of businesses’ profits:\nThis report was prepared by Paul Burnham of CBO’s Tax Analysis Division.\n\nLiquidations and Dissolutions: Critical Tax Implications for Businesses\nProactive Steps to Minimize Negative Income Tax Consequences\nRecording of a 110-minute CPE\/CLE webinar with Q&A\nThis CLE webinar will update advisors' awareness of the key federal income tax implications throughout the business dissolution or liquidation processes, and offer alternative tax compliance and tax planning strategies. - Differences in dissolutions vs. liquidations\n- When a company legally remains in business even though it has dissolved\n- Whether a company’s status as a corporation is ended by an administrative dissolution\n- Distribution of gains and losses to shareholders in a liquidation\n- Taxation at both the business and shareholder levels in a liquidation\n- Tax issues of common transactions in a dissolution or liquidation\n- Shareholder loans to a from a business\n- Handling contingent liabilities\n- Working with different state processes for dissolving a business\n- Errors and omissions in a depreciation schedule\n- Possible tax planning issues\n- Tax differences between repossession of assets for debt payment, and debt forgiveness\n- Timing of sales of high-cost-basis assets at a loss to offset gains on sales of zero- or low-basis assets\n- Timing sales of assets with payment of deductible business expenses, to avoid large Schedule F losses in one year and large gains in another\n- Tax consequences of converting from C corporation to S corporation or LLC, and vice versa\nThe panel will cover these and other relevant topics:\n- Understanding the tax differences between administrative dissolution and liquidation, and whether it's possible for a business to close without suffering the tax bite of complete liquidation. - Employing tax strategies to handle commonplace transactions such as shareholder loans to and from a business and contingent liabilities. - Undertaking tax planning for higher-level issues — such as timing sales of high-cost-basis assets at a loss, sale of assets to offset payment of deductible business expenses, or a partner buyout through stock redemption.

The S corporation is more attractive to small-business owners than a regular (or C) corporation because an S corporation has some appealing tax benefits and still provides business owners with the liability protection of a corporation. With an S corporation, income and losses are passed through to shareholders and included on their individual tax returns. As a result, there’s just one level of federal tax to pay. In addition, owners of S corporations who don’t have inventory can use the cash method of accounting, which is simpler than the accrual method. S corporations can also have up to 100 shareholders. This makes it possible to have more investors and thus attract more capital, tax experts maintain. S corporations do come with some downsides. For example, S corporations are subject to many of the same rules corporations must follow, and that means higher legal and tax service costs. They also must file articles of incorporation, hold directors and shareholders meetings, keep corporate minutes, and allow shareholders to vote on major corporate decisions. The legal and accounting costs of setting up an S corporation are also similar to those for a regular corporation. Another major difference between a regular corporation and an S corporation is that S corporations can only issue one class of stock. Experts say this can hamper the company’s ability to raise capital. In addition, unlike in a regular corporation, S corporation stock can only be owned by individuals, estates and certain types of trusts. In 1998, tax-exempt organizations such as qualified pension plans were added to the list. This change provides S corporations with even greater access to capital because a number of pension plans are willing to invest in closely held small-business stock. Putting Inc. to Paper\nTo start the process of incorporating, contact the secretary of state or the state office that's responsible for registering corporations in your state. Ask for instructions, forms and fee schedules on incorporating. It's possible to file for incorporation without the help of an attorney by using books and software to guide you. Your expense will be the cost of these resources, the filing fees and other costs associated with incorporating in your state. If you do it yourself, you'll save the expense of using a lawyer, which can cost from $500 to $5,000 if you choose a firm that specializes in startup businesses. The disadvantage is that the process may take you some time to accomplish. There is also a chance you could miss some small but important detail in your state’s law. One of the first steps in the incorporation process is to prepare a certificate or articles of incorporation. Some states provide a printed form for this, which either you or your attorney can complete. The corporation will also need a set of bylaws that describe in greater detail than the articles how the corporation will run, including the responsibilities of the company’s shareholders, directors and officers; when stockholder meetings will be held; and other details important to running the company. Once your articles of incorporation are accepted, the secretary of state’s office will send you a certificate of incorporation. Laying the Foundation\nWhen making a decision about which business structure to use, answering the following questions should help you narrow down which entity is right for you:\n- How many owners will your company have, and what will their roles be? - Are you concerned about the tax consequences of your business structure? - Do you want to consider having employees become owners in the company? - Can you deal with the added costs that come with selecting a complicated business structure? - How much paperwork are you prepared to deal with? - Do you want to make all the decisions in the company? - Are you planning to go public? - Do you want to protect your personal resources from debts or other claims against your company? - Are family succession issues a concern? Even after you settle on a business structure, remember that the circumstances that make one type of business organization favorable are always subject to changes in the laws. It makes sense to reassess your form of business from time to time to make sure you are using the one that provides the most benefits.\n\nIf you've been in business for a while as a sole proprietor, you may be wondering whether it would be a good idea to incorporate. We can help you make that decision with information on: why a business owner would want to incorporate, how a corporation is structured, and how corporations are taxed. Reasons for incorporating\nPicture this: You started a small landscaping business a few years ago as a sole proprietorship with three employees. Demand was so great for your services that you kept hiring more people and taking on debt to purchase more equipment, and the number of customers has soared. But lately you've started to wonder: What happens if business slows and you can't pay back all the debt? What if a disgruntled employee or unhappy customer sues you? As a sole proprietor you're personally liable for any bad debts and legal judgments against your business, meaning that your home and other personal assets are likely at risk. When you incorporate, you're creating a completely separate legal entity, one that can shoulder the liability burden you had been carrying yourself (or if you are a partnership, the burden you and the other partners were carrying). Forming a corporation also allows you to:\n- Reward and retain key staff by giving workers a piece of the business. - Have more options for raising funds. Instead of going into more debt, you can attract equity investors. - Shift tax liability away from you to the corporate entity. But you'll have to weigh some disadvantages as well:\n- It usually takes more time and money to incorporate than to form other types of businesses. - Corporations typically are subject to more regulation at both the federal and state level, and the tax rules can be more complicated. - The management structure of a corporation is usually more rigid, often giving you, as the owner, less flexibility to run things as you see fit. Typically, a corporation has a three-tiered structure, which consists of:\n- Shareholders: As company owners, they are the linchpins of the corporation. They often have the power to select and remove directors, amend bylaws, approve the sale of assets and dissolve the corporation. You don't necessarily have to have a lot of shareholders. In fact, most states permit one person to hold 100% of the corporation's stock. - Directors: They act on behalf of the stockholders, managing the company, making major decisions about the firm's direction and electing company officers. Most states allow corporations to have a single director, but some require a minimum of three. - Officers: In most states, corporations must have at least a president, secretary and treasurer to handle day-to-day running of the business, but many states also allow one person to hold all three positions. Steps to becoming a corporation\nTo get your corporation started, you'll need to draw up Articles of Incorporation in the state where your business is headquartered. The articles declare basic facts about the company, including its name, purpose and the number of shares authorized. You file this document with the appropriate state office (usually the Secretary of State or Department of Commerce) and pay a filing fee, which can be as much as several hundred dollars. You may want to hire an attorney to handle the process. Most states will process your filing and send you a Certificate of Incorporation. With your Certificate in hand, you can take the next steps, including appointing directors and holding your first directors' meeting. You'll need to draw up bylaws, which detail the rights of the shareholders, directors and officers. You also must issue stock. It doesn't have to be widely-held, but generally must be distributed to everyone who is an owner of the corporation. Tax issues for corporations\nOnce you have incorporated, you'll probably notice a big difference in how your company is treated for tax purposes. You'll no longer file Schedule C and report your net profit or loss on your 1040. Instead, the corporation files a business tax return, Form 1120, and if it is a C-Corp, pays tax on its corporate profits. Many owners of new, small corporations may get a pleasant surprise at tax time. That's because sole proprietors can't deduct any salaries they pay themselves, but after incorporating they become employees, and their compensation can be written off by the corporate entity. Once those and other deductions are taken, there may be little corporate profit left to tax.\n\nAn S corporation owner who works for the company must be paid a reasonable income and must pay tax and FICA on that amount. This tax status prevents double taxation because S corporation profits are dispersed to shareholders. Another benefit of S corporation status is that a S corp owner can deduct 20% of his or her share of business income from his or her taxes, in addition to the typical deductions for business expenses. The owner's income as an employee is used to compute the Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction. Personal service firms such as accountancy, law, consulting, and financial services are not eligible for this deduction. Furthermore, for higher-income business owners, the QBI deduction is limited or unavailable. Using IRS Form 8832\nEntity Classification Election to be taxed as a corporation. The choice to be taxed as a new entity takes effect on the date provided on line 8 of Form 8832. The election cannot take effect more than 75 days before or after the filing date, and it cannot take effect more than 12 months after the filing date. A consent statement is included in the form 8832, which can be signed by all members or by one person on behalf of all members. If only one person signs, there should be a record in the company membership meetings that this election was approved by all members, form 8832. You must supply the names of the owners as well as the number(s) of owners (Social Security Number for a single-member LLC, and Employer ID Number for multiple member LLC). Use IRS Form 2553 - Election by a Small Business Corporation to be taxed as a S Corporation. You must file by March 15 for the new tax classification to take effect for the entire year. You'll need to include information on each shareholder, such as their name and address, the number of shares they own, their Social Security number, the end of their tax year, and a consent statement. The LLC's Tax Benefits\nAvoids Double Taxation\nThe LLC owner is not subject to double taxes, which is a benefit over corporations. A corporation pays corporate taxes, while the corporation's owners are shareholders who pay taxes on dividends received. Corporations are subject to double taxation, which means that the corporation pays income taxes and shareholders pay dividend taxes. Corporate Franchise Tax Can Be Avoided\nCorporations must pay state corporate franchise taxes in some states, but LLCs are not required to do so in others. This varies widely by state, so check with your state's tax department to see what they require. Small Business Owner Tax Deductions\nLLC owners and other small business owners can now take advantage of a new deduction not accessible to corporation shareholders. It's known as the Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction, and it allows LLC owners to deduct 20% of their net income in addition to their standard business cost deductions. The LLC's Tax Disadvantages\nLLC members are required to pay taxes on their distributive part of the company's profits, even if they have not received a distribution of those profits. Profits are not taxed unless they are given to shareholders, usually in the form of dividends. Taxes Due on Self-Employment\nSelf-employment taxes (Social Security\/Medicare) also hurt LLC owners hard. While corporation employees pay half of the self-employment tax and the company pays the other half, the LLC owner pays both employer and employee amounts. What is the definition of a business structure? A business structure is a form of legal structure for a company. It's critical to take your time when beginning a new firm to choose the correct sort of business entity. The business structure you choose has little impact on the day-to-day operations of your company, but it is critical for identifying ownership, minimising personal liability, managing business taxes, and planning for future expansion. Business entities, at their most basic level, establish the company as a legal entity capable of having bank accounts, entering into contracts, and conducting business without having to do it in your personal name. Working under your own name may be fine for some very small firms, but if you expect to earn a full-time income from the business, sign contracts, or recruit workers, you need to establish a business structure and register with your state. Understanding Business Structures\nIf you've ever worked, rented a home, or purchased a car, you've probably signed a contract in which you acted as yourself.\n\nAdvantages of a Corporation\nIn addition to the limited liability protection enjoyed by shareholders, a corporation offers many other advantages over other types of entities:\n- Ownership interests in the business are freely transferable:\nthe ready transferability of shares in the corporation facilitates estate planning;\n- Shares of the company may be sold to investors in order to raise capital;\n- Corporations, to a much greater extent sole proprietorships and partnerships, may take advantage of pension plans, medical payment plans, group life and accident plans, and other fringe benefits available under the Internal Revenue Code. - A corporation exists forever, so long as corporate regulations are met. There is no need to cease operations if a shareholder, director, or officer dies. How a Corporation is Taxed: C and S Corporations\nA \"for-profit\" corporation may be taxed in one of two ways: under Subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code (a \"C\" Corporation) or under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code (an \"S\" Corporation). A corporation taxed at the entity level is known as a C corporation. Income that has been taxed at the entity level will again be taxed if, and when, is distributed as dividends to shareholders. This double taxation is, perhaps, the single greatest disadvantage to operating a business as a corporation. However, S Corporations may avoid much of this double taxation. Requirements for S Corporation Election\nTo elect to be treated as an S Corporation, certain requirements must be met and an election form must be filed with the IRS. The main requirements are:\n- There may be no more than 100 shareholders;\n- Only one class of stock is permitted;\n- Shareholders must be individuals , estates, or certain types of trusts, and must not be nonresident aliens;\nIf a corporation elects to be taxed as an S Corporation and meets the requirements, it will be taxed at the federal level very similarly to partnerships and limited liability companies. That is, the income, losses, and gains will be passed through directly to the shareholders and there will be no tax \"at the entity level.\" What is an LLC or Limited Liability Company? A limited liability company, or LLC, may be formed by one or more owners, called members. It provides members with limited liability protection for their personal assets in most cases, just as a corporation does for its shareholders. It also offers the members with \"pass-through\" taxation like a sole proprietorship or partnership, avoiding the potential of double taxation in a C Corporation. How to Form an LLC\nLike a corporation, an LLC is formed at the state level by filing Articles of Organization with the Secretary of State. For a single member LLC, this is essentially all that is required to begin operating a business as an LLC. If the LLC has two or more members, they will need to enter into an operating agreement, similar to a partnership agreement, which should be in writing. This often requires the expertise of an attorney to be properly prepared, and adds to the cost of forming an LLC. Owners and Management in an LLC\nAn LLC may have an unlimited number of owners and there are no restrictions on the type of persons who may be owners. One of the main advantages of an LLC over a corporation is the greater flexibility in the management of the business. An LLC may be managed in the following ways:\n- solely by its members;\n- by one or more managers;\n- by its members and officers. Though an LLC and an S Corporation are both \"pass-through\" tax entities, an LLC is not subject to the requirements that must be met in order to be an S corporation. There are no restrictions on the type of persons who may be members in an LLC. The LLC may have an unlimited number of members, and the LLC may have more than one class of equity interest. Further, an LLC, unlike an S Corporation, may provide for allocations of profits, losses, and distributions disproportionate to the percentage of equity interest held in the LLC. Disadvantages of an LLC\nCompared to a corporation, an LLC is a less favorable entity choice as far as raising capital from outside investors or offering ownership interests to employees. The corporation structure has been in existence far longer than the LLC and is better understood with respect to its structure and how ownership interests are represented in stock certificates. These characteristics have less certainty and may be more difficult to comprehend in an LLC because of the potential complexity of an LLC operating agreement. What Are the Types of Partnerships?\n\nSo, it is a separate legal entity with rights and responsibilities of its own. It has its own tax ID, whatever. The other option would be a limited liability company. So, a limited liability company is a creature of the state. So essentially whether you’re going to form a C Corp or an LLC, the processes are the same. You tend to go; you need to choose what state you’re gonna incorporate. And that would be not just, I know everyone rushes for Delaware because of the brand name recognition, presumably, but I would recommend that some more thought be given, especially if you’re going to do business in the US and if you’re going to have any US Nexus, chances are, you may want to consider whether you’re going to form that initial entity in the state, in which you would trigger some sort of connection. But anyway, let’s just talk generally. So an LLC, it’s called a limited liability company, but you can make an election for it to be treated like a C Corp. If you don’t make that election, the default is that it’s a pass through. So it’s kind of like a hybrid entity. So the equivalent in Singapore, if I had to, I’d say, it’s like, if it’s a single member, LLC, so there’s just like one person who owns, it will be like a sole proprietorship. If more than one person owns it, it’ll be treated like the Singapore equivalent of a limited liability partnership or an LLP. So that’s what an LLC is. What’s the difference? One is passed through. So, the income that the LLC earned is not taxable in the hands of the LLC. So the difference is tax. It’s actually taxable in the hands of the members of the LLC, whether it’s you guys as individuals, or if you may hold your membership in that LLC via a Singapore entity, for example, or BVI or some other structures. So, it will be taxable in the hands of whoever’s behind the LLC, not the LLC. Whereas a C Corp, it’s taxable in the hands of the C Corp. It does get a bit more involved in it, but that tends to be the key difference. The C Corp is viewed as a more formal structure. And if it is, especially if you want to bring in their property investors, they tend to prefer C Corp. When I say formal, I mean that the compliance burden is slightly higher and that, you know, I mean, either way, you’d want to make sure that everything, you know, you do meetings and meetings are minuted. You have a separate bank account, you know, all the normal, let’s say financial hygiene that you want to exercise in running an entity would apply in either of them. But the bar slightly higher and when it comes to C Corp. In addition to it, a C Corp is subject to double tax of the income. What do I mean by that? So, when the company earns a profit, it files its own return to C Corp. It files its own return, pays corporate tax at 21%, and then, the dividends can be extracted by the shareholders. And when the shareholders received those returns, it is often subject to taxes as well. So the income is being taxed twice, one in the hands of the company, and then with dividends extracted is going to be taxed again in the hands of the shareholders. Whereas when it’s an LLC, the LLC doesn’t pay tax, only the members behind it. So I hope that helps, but I would normally say that in order to make a recommendation, we would need to understand the business model inside out. So, that’s where having a better idea of what your main objectives and the nature of the structure of the businesses, the business, et cetera. Basically, see a pitch deck or business plan that will help us advise accordingly. So those are my thoughts on C Corp versus LLC. Part C. So this person had like four parts, right? So A, B, C, and D. C what are the tax implications or tax obligations? Well… It depends, right? So remember we’re saying that if you have no Nexus in the US, everything is going to be taxable by IRS and Singapore. Right? But let’s put that to one side and let’s say that, you know, you do have, you do trigger some sort of presence in the US. I think everyone is well familiar with the direct taxes. So you’re familiar with corporate taxes.","passages":[{"passage":"When conceptualizing a new venture, this decision is seldom given the thought and consideration it deserves. Start your business the right way by addressing this first. By Michael F. O'Keefe\nWHETHER SETTING UP YOUR BUSINESS as a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company (LLC), S-Corporation, or C-Corporation, it is vital to understand, not only the filing and paperwork requirements, but also the different tax implications that are present with each type of business structure. Commonly, owner-operated small businesses are set up as sole proprietorships due to the simplicity of the filings and regulation, as well as the single-layer tax impact on the revenues of the business. This type of ownership also allows the owner to be his or her own boss. However, owners should be extremely cautious when dealing as a sole proprietor or in a general partnership. These two types of business structures allow for all of the liabilities of the business to be shared with the individual owners on a personal level. As such, unlimited liability can be scary. Just remember to hope for the best but plan for the worst. Don’t choose a business structure based on the ease and convenience of setting it up. It is more common than one would think to have business situations end in lawsuits resulting in general partners and sole proprietors being sued personally and losing homes, cars and savings accounts. There are plenty of hurdles that these types of business owners have to overcome. Management can be difficult with limited participants and there is commonly a very overwhelming time commitment associated with this type of business. There are two types of members in a partnership: a general partner and a limited partner. General partners have unlimited liability and they are typically managers of the company. Limited partners have exactly what you would think: limited liability. They, also, usually do not have a role managing the company. Just remember, no matter how well the individual partners get along, one of the most common issues with partnerships is the disagreements that arise between members. This sometimes leads to unfortunate falling-outs between friends. Most successful types of businesses are corporations—either limited liability companies, conventional corporations (C-Corps), or S-Corporations. These three forms of business ownership comprise approximately 80% of all sales in the United States and they all share two major benefits; the first being that they have limited liability, and the second, they usually qualify for special tax advantages that other types of business ownerships do not. Incorporating a business is a great strategy as it allows for the company to grow, it has perpetual life, ownership can change hands easily, and it’s common for corporations to be able to afford talented employees. However, as a sword can cut both ways, there are some disadvantages to incorporating a business. Corporations are more costly to start, they require more paperwork, possible conflicts with other owners and board members can arise, and they are also affected by double taxation, which means that the business’ profits will be taxed, as well as the shareholders’ dividends. A special type of incorporation is called an S-Corporation. Aside from sharing the benefit of limited liability, this type of corporation has a major difference from a conventional C-Corporation: It has much simpler taxes, called ‘single taxation,’ that are similar to that of a partnership. Downsides of incorporating as an S-Corporation include ineligibility for a dividends received deduction, and that S-Corps are not subject to the 10% of taxable income limitation that are applicable to charitable contribution deductions. Choosing the best type of business is a personal choice, albeit one that shouldn’t be taken lightly. The prospected longevity, growth and future development of the business should be taken into serious consideration before the choice to incorporate is made.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:188d93e4-153f-4ec4-ba2c-91dce1e33bb5>"]},{"passage":"When it comes to setting up corporate structures there are a variety of considerations to bear in mind. There are both commercial and tax implications that need to be considered. The adage that the tax tail should not wag the commercial dog is very true in these situations. However, one of the main commercial considerations in determining the best structure for the business is actually to consider the tax implications, as they will have a big impact on the financials for the business. Setting up a Limited company:\nA Limited company structure provides important protection due to the \"limited liability\" characteristic of companies. By being a Limited liability company it means that the shareholders are protected from loss of their own personal assets. Another advantage of Limited company status is the current favourable taxation treatment of companies compared with sole traders\/individuals. Some problems inherent with a Limited liability structure include that the structure is rather rigid in that incoming or exiting shareholders will have various implications for the business - and there will be taxation implications on the disposal of shares or \"company buy back\" of shares. Limited Liability Partnerships:\nLimited liability partnerships allow for greater flexibility in that profits sharing ratios can be changed dependant on private agreements of the Partners. The main constituational document of the partnership will be the partnership agreement. This will control the way in which the partnership interacts and behaves with its members and the way in which business is conducted by the partnership. An LLP is tax transparent and therefore the taxation of the profits of the partnership fall onto the \"members\" of the LLP. There are a variety of benefits in setting up a corporate group structure - either at the inception of the business or at a future point in time. We have advised many clients on the benefits of setting up a corporate structure such that they can benefit from important tax reliefs such as Substantial Shareholders' exemption on a disposal of part of the business. It is important to liaise with us in advance of making any important decisions as there will often be certain ways of carrying out transactions that will be more beneficial from a taxation perspective.

Failing to comply with tax laws can result in penalties and fines, so it's essential to stay informed about the tax considerations that apply to your business. In this blog post, we will explore some of the key tax considerations that small businesses need to be aware of. The type of business structure you choose, such as sole proprietorship, partnership, LLC or corporation, will affect how your business is taxed. It's essential to understand the tax implications of each business structure and choose the one that best suits your needs. Small businesses can claim deductions for various business expenses, such as office rent, employee salaries, office supplies, and more. Be sure to keep accurate records and receipts of your business expenses to maximize your deductions. Depending on the type of business you run, you may be required to collect sales taxes from customers and remit them to the government. It's important to understand the sales tax laws that apply to your business and to stay current with changes in the tax code. Self-employed individuals and small business owners are often required to pay estimated taxes throughout the year. It's important to understand the rules for estimated taxes and to make timely payments to avoid penalties. As an employer, you are responsible for withholding taxes from your employees' paychecks and remitting them to the government. You must also file the necessary forms with the government to report the taxes you have withheld. Small business owners can take advantage of retirement plans, such as a solo 401(k) or a Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRA, to save for retirement and reduce their tax liabilities.

That shift has reduced federal revenues but probably promoted overall investment and a more efficient allocation of resources. Most business receipts—the revenues that businesses receive from sales of goods and services—come from a relatively small number of firms subject to the corporate income tax, called C corporations. However, other organizational forms allow businesses to avoid the corporate tax by passing their profits through to their owners, where they are subject to the individual income tax. Use of those pass-through structures has grown: In 1980, 83 percent of firms passed profits through to their owners for taxation, and they accounted for 14 percent of business receipts; by 2007, those shares had increased to 94 percent and 38 percent, respectively. Organizational forms that provide owners with the same protection from liability for the debts of the firm that the owners of C corporations receive were almost entirely responsible for that growth. Today’s CBO report Taxing Businesses Through the Individual Income Tax examines the size and causes of the shift in organizational structure, the effect it has had on federal revenues, and the potential effects on revenues and investment of various alternative approaches to taxing businesses’ profits. The report examines three potential approaches to the taxation of businesses’ profits:\nThis report was prepared by Paul Burnham of CBO’s Tax Analysis Division.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:4ac0a158-31cd-499a-b409-6434a4906983>"]},{"passage":"Liquidations and Dissolutions: Critical Tax Implications for Businesses\nProactive Steps to Minimize Negative Income Tax Consequences\nRecording of a 110-minute CPE\/CLE webinar with Q&A\nThis CLE webinar will update advisors' awareness of the key federal income tax implications throughout the business dissolution or liquidation processes, and offer alternative tax compliance and tax planning strategies. - Differences in dissolutions vs. liquidations\n- When a company legally remains in business even though it has dissolved\n- Whether a company’s status as a corporation is ended by an administrative dissolution\n- Distribution of gains and losses to shareholders in a liquidation\n- Taxation at both the business and shareholder levels in a liquidation\n- Tax issues of common transactions in a dissolution or liquidation\n- Shareholder loans to a from a business\n- Handling contingent liabilities\n- Working with different state processes for dissolving a business\n- Errors and omissions in a depreciation schedule\n- Possible tax planning issues\n- Tax differences between repossession of assets for debt payment, and debt forgiveness\n- Timing of sales of high-cost-basis assets at a loss to offset gains on sales of zero- or low-basis assets\n- Timing sales of assets with payment of deductible business expenses, to avoid large Schedule F losses in one year and large gains in another\n- Tax consequences of converting from C corporation to S corporation or LLC, and vice versa\nThe panel will cover these and other relevant topics:\n- Understanding the tax differences between administrative dissolution and liquidation, and whether it's possible for a business to close without suffering the tax bite of complete liquidation. - Employing tax strategies to handle commonplace transactions such as shareholder loans to and from a business and contingent liabilities. - Undertaking tax planning for higher-level issues — such as timing sales of high-cost-basis assets at a loss, sale of assets to offset payment of deductible business expenses, or a partner buyout through stock redemption.

The S corporation is more attractive to small-business owners than a regular (or C) corporation because an S corporation has some appealing tax benefits and still provides business owners with the liability protection of a corporation. With an S corporation, income and losses are passed through to shareholders and included on their individual tax returns. As a result, there’s just one level of federal tax to pay. In addition, owners of S corporations who don’t have inventory can use the cash method of accounting, which is simpler than the accrual method. S corporations can also have up to 100 shareholders. This makes it possible to have more investors and thus attract more capital, tax experts maintain. S corporations do come with some downsides. For example, S corporations are subject to many of the same rules corporations must follow, and that means higher legal and tax service costs. They also must file articles of incorporation, hold directors and shareholders meetings, keep corporate minutes, and allow shareholders to vote on major corporate decisions. The legal and accounting costs of setting up an S corporation are also similar to those for a regular corporation. Another major difference between a regular corporation and an S corporation is that S corporations can only issue one class of stock. Experts say this can hamper the company’s ability to raise capital. In addition, unlike in a regular corporation, S corporation stock can only be owned by individuals, estates and certain types of trusts. In 1998, tax-exempt organizations such as qualified pension plans were added to the list. This change provides S corporations with even greater access to capital because a number of pension plans are willing to invest in closely held small-business stock. Putting Inc. to Paper\nTo start the process of incorporating, contact the secretary of state or the state office that's responsible for registering corporations in your state. Ask for instructions, forms and fee schedules on incorporating. It's possible to file for incorporation without the help of an attorney by using books and software to guide you. Your expense will be the cost of these resources, the filing fees and other costs associated with incorporating in your state. If you do it yourself, you'll save the expense of using a lawyer, which can cost from $500 to $5,000 if you choose a firm that specializes in startup businesses. The disadvantage is that the process may take you some time to accomplish. There is also a chance you could miss some small but important detail in your state’s law. One of the first steps in the incorporation process is to prepare a certificate or articles of incorporation. Some states provide a printed form for this, which either you or your attorney can complete. The corporation will also need a set of bylaws that describe in greater detail than the articles how the corporation will run, including the responsibilities of the company’s shareholders, directors and officers; when stockholder meetings will be held; and other details important to running the company. Once your articles of incorporation are accepted, the secretary of state’s office will send you a certificate of incorporation. Laying the Foundation\nWhen making a decision about which business structure to use, answering the following questions should help you narrow down which entity is right for you:\n- How many owners will your company have, and what will their roles be? - Are you concerned about the tax consequences of your business structure? - Do you want to consider having employees become owners in the company? - Can you deal with the added costs that come with selecting a complicated business structure? - How much paperwork are you prepared to deal with? - Do you want to make all the decisions in the company? - Are you planning to go public? - Do you want to protect your personal resources from debts or other claims against your company? - Are family succession issues a concern? Even after you settle on a business structure, remember that the circumstances that make one type of business organization favorable are always subject to changes in the laws. It makes sense to reassess your form of business from time to time to make sure you are using the one that provides the most benefits.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:f791fc24-a91f-4e4c-b822-b5316b13faa9>"]},{"passage":"If you've been in business for a while as a sole proprietor, you may be wondering whether it would be a good idea to incorporate. We can help you make that decision with information on: why a business owner would want to incorporate, how a corporation is structured, and how corporations are taxed. Reasons for incorporating\nPicture this: You started a small landscaping business a few years ago as a sole proprietorship with three employees. Demand was so great for your services that you kept hiring more people and taking on debt to purchase more equipment, and the number of customers has soared. But lately you've started to wonder: What happens if business slows and you can't pay back all the debt? What if a disgruntled employee or unhappy customer sues you? As a sole proprietor you're personally liable for any bad debts and legal judgments against your business, meaning that your home and other personal assets are likely at risk. When you incorporate, you're creating a completely separate legal entity, one that can shoulder the liability burden you had been carrying yourself (or if you are a partnership, the burden you and the other partners were carrying). Forming a corporation also allows you to:\n- Reward and retain key staff by giving workers a piece of the business. - Have more options for raising funds. Instead of going into more debt, you can attract equity investors. - Shift tax liability away from you to the corporate entity. But you'll have to weigh some disadvantages as well:\n- It usually takes more time and money to incorporate than to form other types of businesses. - Corporations typically are subject to more regulation at both the federal and state level, and the tax rules can be more complicated. - The management structure of a corporation is usually more rigid, often giving you, as the owner, less flexibility to run things as you see fit. Typically, a corporation has a three-tiered structure, which consists of:\n- Shareholders: As company owners, they are the linchpins of the corporation. They often have the power to select and remove directors, amend bylaws, approve the sale of assets and dissolve the corporation. You don't necessarily have to have a lot of shareholders. In fact, most states permit one person to hold 100% of the corporation's stock. - Directors: They act on behalf of the stockholders, managing the company, making major decisions about the firm's direction and electing company officers. Most states allow corporations to have a single director, but some require a minimum of three. - Officers: In most states, corporations must have at least a president, secretary and treasurer to handle day-to-day running of the business, but many states also allow one person to hold all three positions. Steps to becoming a corporation\nTo get your corporation started, you'll need to draw up Articles of Incorporation in the state where your business is headquartered. The articles declare basic facts about the company, including its name, purpose and the number of shares authorized. You file this document with the appropriate state office (usually the Secretary of State or Department of Commerce) and pay a filing fee, which can be as much as several hundred dollars. You may want to hire an attorney to handle the process. Most states will process your filing and send you a Certificate of Incorporation. With your Certificate in hand, you can take the next steps, including appointing directors and holding your first directors' meeting. You'll need to draw up bylaws, which detail the rights of the shareholders, directors and officers. You also must issue stock. It doesn't have to be widely-held, but generally must be distributed to everyone who is an owner of the corporation. Tax issues for corporations\nOnce you have incorporated, you'll probably notice a big difference in how your company is treated for tax purposes. You'll no longer file Schedule C and report your net profit or loss on your 1040. Instead, the corporation files a business tax return, Form 1120, and if it is a C-Corp, pays tax on its corporate profits. Many owners of new, small corporations may get a pleasant surprise at tax time. That's because sole proprietors can't deduct any salaries they pay themselves, but after incorporating they become employees, and their compensation can be written off by the corporate entity. Once those and other deductions are taken, there may be little corporate profit left to tax.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:83eceb1e-5134-454e-a3a1-e7b909f9ee7f>"]},{"passage":"An S corporation owner who works for the company must be paid a reasonable income and must pay tax and FICA on that amount. This tax status prevents double taxation because S corporation profits are dispersed to shareholders. Another benefit of S corporation status is that a S corp owner can deduct 20% of his or her share of business income from his or her taxes, in addition to the typical deductions for business expenses. The owner's income as an employee is used to compute the Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction. Personal service firms such as accountancy, law, consulting, and financial services are not eligible for this deduction. Furthermore, for higher-income business owners, the QBI deduction is limited or unavailable. Using IRS Form 8832\nEntity Classification Election to be taxed as a corporation. The choice to be taxed as a new entity takes effect on the date provided on line 8 of Form 8832. The election cannot take effect more than 75 days before or after the filing date, and it cannot take effect more than 12 months after the filing date. A consent statement is included in the form 8832, which can be signed by all members or by one person on behalf of all members. If only one person signs, there should be a record in the company membership meetings that this election was approved by all members, form 8832. You must supply the names of the owners as well as the number(s) of owners (Social Security Number for a single-member LLC, and Employer ID Number for multiple member LLC). Use IRS Form 2553 - Election by a Small Business Corporation to be taxed as a S Corporation. You must file by March 15 for the new tax classification to take effect for the entire year. You'll need to include information on each shareholder, such as their name and address, the number of shares they own, their Social Security number, the end of their tax year, and a consent statement. The LLC's Tax Benefits\nAvoids Double Taxation\nThe LLC owner is not subject to double taxes, which is a benefit over corporations. A corporation pays corporate taxes, while the corporation's owners are shareholders who pay taxes on dividends received. Corporations are subject to double taxation, which means that the corporation pays income taxes and shareholders pay dividend taxes. Corporate Franchise Tax Can Be Avoided\nCorporations must pay state corporate franchise taxes in some states, but LLCs are not required to do so in others. This varies widely by state, so check with your state's tax department to see what they require. Small Business Owner Tax Deductions\nLLC owners and other small business owners can now take advantage of a new deduction not accessible to corporation shareholders. It's known as the Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction, and it allows LLC owners to deduct 20% of their net income in addition to their standard business cost deductions. The LLC's Tax Disadvantages\nLLC members are required to pay taxes on their distributive part of the company's profits, even if they have not received a distribution of those profits. Profits are not taxed unless they are given to shareholders, usually in the form of dividends. Taxes Due on Self-Employment\nSelf-employment taxes (Social Security\/Medicare) also hurt LLC owners hard. While corporation employees pay half of the self-employment tax and the company pays the other half, the LLC owner pays both employer and employee amounts. What is the definition of a business structure? A business structure is a form of legal structure for a company. It's critical to take your time when beginning a new firm to choose the correct sort of business entity. The business structure you choose has little impact on the day-to-day operations of your company, but it is critical for identifying ownership, minimising personal liability, managing business taxes, and planning for future expansion. Business entities, at their most basic level, establish the company as a legal entity capable of having bank accounts, entering into contracts, and conducting business without having to do it in your personal name. Working under your own name may be fine for some very small firms, but if you expect to earn a full-time income from the business, sign contracts, or recruit workers, you need to establish a business structure and register with your state. Understanding Business Structures\nIf you've ever worked, rented a home, or purchased a car, you've probably signed a contract in which you acted as yourself.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:38a500a4-36e7-45d7-9625-e906a4ee117e>"]},{"passage":"Advantages of a Corporation\nIn addition to the limited liability protection enjoyed by shareholders, a corporation offers many other advantages over other types of entities:\n- Ownership interests in the business are freely transferable:\nthe ready transferability of shares in the corporation facilitates estate planning;\n- Shares of the company may be sold to investors in order to raise capital;\n- Corporations, to a much greater extent sole proprietorships and partnerships, may take advantage of pension plans, medical payment plans, group life and accident plans, and other fringe benefits available under the Internal Revenue Code. - A corporation exists forever, so long as corporate regulations are met. There is no need to cease operations if a shareholder, director, or officer dies. How a Corporation is Taxed: C and S Corporations\nA \"for-profit\" corporation may be taxed in one of two ways: under Subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code (a \"C\" Corporation) or under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code (an \"S\" Corporation). A corporation taxed at the entity level is known as a C corporation. Income that has been taxed at the entity level will again be taxed if, and when, is distributed as dividends to shareholders. This double taxation is, perhaps, the single greatest disadvantage to operating a business as a corporation. However, S Corporations may avoid much of this double taxation. Requirements for S Corporation Election\nTo elect to be treated as an S Corporation, certain requirements must be met and an election form must be filed with the IRS. The main requirements are:\n- There may be no more than 100 shareholders;\n- Only one class of stock is permitted;\n- Shareholders must be individuals , estates, or certain types of trusts, and must not be nonresident aliens;\nIf a corporation elects to be taxed as an S Corporation and meets the requirements, it will be taxed at the federal level very similarly to partnerships and limited liability companies. That is, the income, losses, and gains will be passed through directly to the shareholders and there will be no tax \"at the entity level.\" What is an LLC or Limited Liability Company? A limited liability company, or LLC, may be formed by one or more owners, called members. It provides members with limited liability protection for their personal assets in most cases, just as a corporation does for its shareholders. It also offers the members with \"pass-through\" taxation like a sole proprietorship or partnership, avoiding the potential of double taxation in a C Corporation. How to Form an LLC\nLike a corporation, an LLC is formed at the state level by filing Articles of Organization with the Secretary of State. For a single member LLC, this is essentially all that is required to begin operating a business as an LLC. If the LLC has two or more members, they will need to enter into an operating agreement, similar to a partnership agreement, which should be in writing. This often requires the expertise of an attorney to be properly prepared, and adds to the cost of forming an LLC. Owners and Management in an LLC\nAn LLC may have an unlimited number of owners and there are no restrictions on the type of persons who may be owners. One of the main advantages of an LLC over a corporation is the greater flexibility in the management of the business. An LLC may be managed in the following ways:\n- solely by its members;\n- by one or more managers;\n- by its members and officers. Though an LLC and an S Corporation are both \"pass-through\" tax entities, an LLC is not subject to the requirements that must be met in order to be an S corporation. There are no restrictions on the type of persons who may be members in an LLC. The LLC may have an unlimited number of members, and the LLC may have more than one class of equity interest. Further, an LLC, unlike an S Corporation, may provide for allocations of profits, losses, and distributions disproportionate to the percentage of equity interest held in the LLC. Disadvantages of an LLC\nCompared to a corporation, an LLC is a less favorable entity choice as far as raising capital from outside investors or offering ownership interests to employees. The corporation structure has been in existence far longer than the LLC and is better understood with respect to its structure and how ownership interests are represented in stock certificates. These characteristics have less certainty and may be more difficult to comprehend in an LLC because of the potential complexity of an LLC operating agreement. What Are the Types of Partnerships?","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:320c5d58-78a0-4ae1-9c10-12cbe56d064e>"]},{"passage":"So, it is a separate legal entity with rights and responsibilities of its own. It has its own tax ID, whatever. The other option would be a limited liability company. So, a limited liability company is a creature of the state. So essentially whether you’re going to form a C Corp or an LLC, the processes are the same. You tend to go; you need to choose what state you’re gonna incorporate. And that would be not just, I know everyone rushes for Delaware because of the brand name recognition, presumably, but I would recommend that some more thought be given, especially if you’re going to do business in the US and if you’re going to have any US Nexus, chances are, you may want to consider whether you’re going to form that initial entity in the state, in which you would trigger some sort of connection. But anyway, let’s just talk generally. So an LLC, it’s called a limited liability company, but you can make an election for it to be treated like a C Corp. If you don’t make that election, the default is that it’s a pass through. So it’s kind of like a hybrid entity. So the equivalent in Singapore, if I had to, I’d say, it’s like, if it’s a single member, LLC, so there’s just like one person who owns, it will be like a sole proprietorship. If more than one person owns it, it’ll be treated like the Singapore equivalent of a limited liability partnership or an LLP. So that’s what an LLC is. What’s the difference? One is passed through. So, the income that the LLC earned is not taxable in the hands of the LLC. So the difference is tax. It’s actually taxable in the hands of the members of the LLC, whether it’s you guys as individuals, or if you may hold your membership in that LLC via a Singapore entity, for example, or BVI or some other structures. So, it will be taxable in the hands of whoever’s behind the LLC, not the LLC. Whereas a C Corp, it’s taxable in the hands of the C Corp. It does get a bit more involved in it, but that tends to be the key difference. The C Corp is viewed as a more formal structure. And if it is, especially if you want to bring in their property investors, they tend to prefer C Corp. When I say formal, I mean that the compliance burden is slightly higher and that, you know, I mean, either way, you’d want to make sure that everything, you know, you do meetings and meetings are minuted. You have a separate bank account, you know, all the normal, let’s say financial hygiene that you want to exercise in running an entity would apply in either of them. But the bar slightly higher and when it comes to C Corp. In addition to it, a C Corp is subject to double tax of the income. What do I mean by that? So, when the company earns a profit, it files its own return to C Corp. It files its own return, pays corporate tax at 21%, and then, the dividends can be extracted by the shareholders. And when the shareholders received those returns, it is often subject to taxes as well. So the income is being taxed twice, one in the hands of the company, and then with dividends extracted is going to be taxed again in the hands of the shareholders. Whereas when it’s an LLC, the LLC doesn’t pay tax, only the members behind it. So I hope that helps, but I would normally say that in order to make a recommendation, we would need to understand the business model inside out. So, that’s where having a better idea of what your main objectives and the nature of the structure of the businesses, the business, et cetera. Basically, see a pitch deck or business plan that will help us advise accordingly. So those are my thoughts on C Corp versus LLC. Part C. So this person had like four parts, right? So A, B, C, and D. C what are the tax implications or tax obligations? Well… It depends, right? So remember we’re saying that if you have no Nexus in the US, everything is going to be taxable by IRS and Singapore. Right? But let’s put that to one side and let’s say that, you know, you do have, you do trigger some sort of presence in the US. I think everyone is well familiar with the direct taxes. So you’re familiar with corporate taxes.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:adbfb368-f19f-46bd-bb69-c6d9098241ce>"]}]}

This offers financial security and emotional freedom to focus on recovery.","answer":"\\boxed{\n\nCritical illness insurance, also known as critical illness cover, is a specialized health insurance product designed to provide financial support in the event of a serious diagnosis. It functions by offering a lump-sum payment to the policyholder upon confirmation of a covered critical illness, such as cancer, heart attack, stroke, organ transplants, and major organ failures.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how critical illness insurance works:\n\n1. Policy Acquisition: Individuals purchase a critical illness insurance policy from an insurance provider. Policies vary in the specific illnesses covered and the conditions required for benefits payment.\n\n2. Premium Payments: To maintain coverage, policyholders are required to pay regular premiums, which can fluctuate based on factors like age and health status.\n\n3. Illness Diagnosis: If a policyholder is diagnosed with a covered critical illness, they must provide the insurance company with the necessary medical documentation, such as a diagnosis letter from a doctor.\n\n4. Benefits Payment: Upon verification that the illness meets the policy's criteria, the insurance company issues a lump-sum benefit payment. This amount is typically fixed and does not change based on treatment costs.\n\nThe advantages of critical illness insurance include:\n\n1. Financial Protection: The lump-sum payment can alleviate the financial burden of medical expenses, treatment costs, and other related expenses, offering financial security during a challenging time.\n\n2. Reduced Stress: Knowing that there is financial support available can ease the stress and anxiety associated with a serious illness diagnosis.\n\n3. Versatile Use of Funds: The lump-sum payment is often tax-free and can be utilized for various purposes, including medical expenses, debt repayment, or personal needs.\n\n4. Comprehensive Coverage: Some policies may offer additional benefits, such as daily payments during hospital stays or support for income lost due to the illness.\n\nWhen considering critical illness insurance, it's crucial to thoroughly review the policy details, including covered illnesses, benefit amounts, exclusions, waiting periods, and any limitations. Personal circumstances and financial requirements should also be factored into the decision-making process.\n\n}","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: Lifestyle diseases are ailments, which occur due to your way of living. These include obesity, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, stroke, and heart diseases. Along with adults, many children also suffer from lifestyle disorders. Lack of physical activities, stressful living, and availability of technological resources are the main reasons for such ailments. Diet and exercise tips to follow\nToday, most people live sedentary lifestyles and sit at their desks for several hours a day. Ideally, you must be physically active and sit only while resting. Sitting continuously in front of your laptop, television, or while driving affects the body in many ways, like:\n- Weight gain, as you burn lesser calories\n- Hormonal imbalances\n- Loss of muscle strength and bone weakening\n- Weakened immunity\n- Lower blood circulation\nHere are some tips to reduce the risk of lifestyle-related diseases:\n- Remain active\n- Walk around every hour and during lunch and other breaks\n- Take the stairs instead of the elevator\n- Exercise regularly\n- Include low-intensity cardiovascular training\n- Take up a sport\n- Do yoga and meditation to relieve stress and anxiety\n- Make dietary changes\n- Eat nutritious and well-balanced meals comprising natural fats and proteins\n- Avoid sugar-laden foods like sodas, candies, and pastries\n- Eliminate fried and processed foods from your diet\n- Drink adequate water to remain hydrated\nTreatment costs for critical illness\nThe treatment expenses for critical illness are on the rise due to inflation. Open heart surgery or organ transplant may cost between INR 5 lakh to INR 10 lakh. Cancer treatment may cost in the range of INR 10 lakh to INR 15 lakh. Heart diseases may require INR lakh 3 to INR 5 lakh for treatment. Have you considered how you will meet these expenses in case of a diagnosis of any illness? A critical illness insurance policy is beneficial to combat these expenses. This insurance plan pays a lump sum if you are diagnosed with any covered ailment. You can utilize the money that you receive from this type of health insurance plan for treatment, household expenses, repaying debt, or any other purpose. Before you opt for health coverage, here are a few things to consider:\n- You need to survive for an approximate period of 30 days from the date of diagnosis; this duration may increase or decrease depending on the kind of illness; in case of demise during this tenure, you do not get any cashless health insurance benefits\n- You must know about the waiting period for pre-existing conditions; it may be up to four years, and you need to find the lowest one to ensure the availability of benefits at the earliest\n- You must compare different health insurance like cholesterol medical cover and Covid-19 insurance from different insurers to find a plan that includes the highest number of critical ailments\n- You must inquire about the additional facilities, such as waiver of premiums, hospital cash, and a second e-opinion of a medical practitioner with the same medical insurance plan\nA critical illness plan is a fixed benefit policy and does not cover hospitalization expenses. It pays a fixed amount on a positive diagnosis after the end of the survival period. To cover hospitalization-related expenses, you may buy a mediclaim policy for additional security.\n\n- Toddler Parenting Experts: Play-Based Learning Muna Bago Formal Schooling\n- Toddler Is 'No' Your Toddler's Favorite Word?

We all know how difficult it is to run into medical issues. We have to figure out where do we go to for a hospital, face high doctor consultancy costs and numerous additional fees that occur with different types of cases (especially emergency ones). But there is a way to help yourself prepare for these types of situations through what most people know as an “HMO.”\nAn HMO, or health maintenance organization, acts as a service for you to access its list of available doctors and clinics and cover most (if not all) of your medical-related costs. In exchange for this service, the HMO charges a yearly premium or fee. As long as you use their list of accredited doctors and clinics, you can find your medical needs more or less covered and settled. An HMO can serve as one of the benefits for employees who work in private companies. A company may offer it as a perk by covering the whole cost of the HMO per employee (no salary deduction). Some companies even cover the HMO of at least one dependent per employee.ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nHow does this differ from health insurance or PhilHealth?CONTINUE READING BELOWRecommended Videos\nType of medical coverage: HMO\nService provider: HMO companies (Medicard, Maxicare, Pacific Cross, etc.) Estimated cost: P500 to upwards of P60,000\nStandard benefits: Outpatient, inpatient, emergency, preventive (only with accredited\/associated hospitals\/clinics of the HMO)\nTransmittal of financial assistance: The accredited hospital or clinic will charge your bill against the consumable limit or amount provided by the HMO.

Think of your standard consultation with your doctor where they prescribe certain medication — that is an outpatient treatment. These are services that require the individual to stay in the hospital for a period of 24 hours or more, with any additional in-hospital needs included. Inpatient services are applicable to situations in which quarantine or extended stay is required for monitoring, as well as situations where certain procedures are needed that take longer than one day to execute. These often fall under situations wherein an individual utilizes the emergency room of various hospitals. Depending on the case, these emergency visits can be covered by your medical plan.ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nHow to decide on the HMO you need\nThe goal of these various medical coverage plans are to make your next medical situation as easy as possible. Health insurance provides the largest amount of benefits (albeit with comparatively high premiums), and PhilHealth provides the most standard service of medical discount on a basic premium (though limited in coverage). An HMO then stands as a comprehensive medical plan that can work towards what you need the most as an individual based on cost\/premium, coverage, and healthcare providers. (If you are employed and HMO is one of the benefits, the company decides of the HMO.) The cost of HMOs is varied — these prices can be as low as P500 for a year’s coverage up to P15,000 in medical consumable benefits.\n\nBeing on workcover is a nightmare! Dealing with your injury,the complex workcover system, your employer, the WorkCover agent, rehabilitation agents, doctors and even lawyers can be mind boggling and very stressful! Here we share few tips that can help you survive WorkCover! Dealing with your injury- especially a permanent injury- and its after-effects can be extremely stressful. Negotiating your way around a very complex WorkCover system, dealing with your employer, the WorkCover agent, rehabilitation agents, doctors, so called “independent medical examiners” and even lawyers can be mind boggling and extremely stressful! Below are a few tips and tricks that can help you survive the WorkCover nightmare!Focus on your health and recovery\nYour highest priority should always be your health and to maximise your physical and\/or psychological recovery.WorkCover must pay for all reasonable treatment costs. We strongly believe that the most important issue is to ensure that you are getting the best quality medical treatment possible. Related blog articles\n- surviving workcover some more tips\n- workcover survival guide for injured workers\n- on being on workcover and what it’s like\nWhen you are seriously injured, you will have to make many important decisions about your future. To make the right decisions it will be critical to understand as much as you possibly can about the structure of WorkCover benefits, for example, how they interact with your other employment entitlements, and what all your entitlements really are. WorkCover is an extremely complex system! The Act of Parliament which governs WorkCover alone is several hundred pages long and quite complicated. Trying to understand just what WorkCover does and does not provide is really important. There are many resources available to help you with this task. The most detailed information, apart from the Act itself, is on the WorkSafe website which contains a very detailed publication called the ‘Online Claims Manual‘. This contains detailed instructions from WorkCover to its agents on how to handle claims. It also includes very detailed information about the calculation and payment of WorkCover benefits. Remember this information is written from WorkCover’s perspective only. Nonetheless this can be a useful resource for people who want detailed information.Try to deal as best you can with WorkCover\nDealing with WorkCover and -especially- your case manager can be extremely stressful.Following a few simple guidelines can make dealing with WorkCover, and your case manager (and rehab providers) a tad easier. - The most important thing is that you keep good, written records. For example, if you want to claim travel expenses you need to submit details of all your trips to and from doctors, incl train, bus, tram, taxi and parking receipts. If there is an argument about your weekly payments because WorkCover feel you are not looking for work, keeping a record of all your attempts to obtain work can put you in a far better position. - We advice all injured workers to only communicate\/correspond in writing, either via email or via letter\/fax. You do have the right to refuse telephone contact and you also have the right to request that all correspondence\/communications go through your legal representative, one of your doctors or an advocate. You can even put a “restraining” order on your harassing, bullying and\/or intimidating case manager (see our workcover tips collection for sample letters). - It’s also very important that you keep a copy of all your documents. For example, when you receive a certificate of incapacity, the original should be provided to your employer but ensure you make a copy for your own records. - Ask under the Freedom of Information Act or the Workers Compensation Act, for a copy of all your medical reports, including independent medical examination reports. - When submitting your medical certificates ensure that you complete the section on the back of the certificate about your work activities. If you don’t it will delay your payments and the form will be sent back to you. It may also be useful to try and ensure that your certificates expire on a Saturday or Sunday to make it easier for WorkCover or your employer to calculate your weekly entitlement. This enables weekly benefits to be paid in whole weeks. - Sometimes (well dare we say “often’) the decisions that a case manager makes can be extremely frustrating. Losing your cool can backfire as you will run the risk of being type cast as difficult or as suffering from a psychological problem!\n\nRecovery after Critical Care Booklet\nIt is recognised that recovering from critical illness does not end when you are discharged from Critical Care. For some people recovery can go on for some time following discharge home. There is a lot of information in this booklet and it is likely you will only have a few of the problems highlighted. We hope you can use it as a resource to pick out the areas where you require some information, reassurance and advice.\n\nWhat You Need to Know About Insurance Parity\nShare Your Story\nShare your personal experiences with parity implementation.

What specific assistance does hospice provide home-based patients? Hospice patients are cared for by a team consisting of a physician, nurse practitioner, a nurse, social workers, certified nursing assistants, clergy, therapists, and volunteers. Each one provides assistance based on his or her own area of expertise. In addition, hospices provide medications, supplies, equipment, and other services related to the terminal illness. Does hospice do anything to make death come sooner? Hospice neither hastens nor postpones dying. Just as doctors and midwives lend support and expertise during the time of child birth, hospice provides its presence and specialized knowledge during the dying process. Is hospice care covered by insurance? Hospice coverage is widely available. It is provided by Medicare nationwide, by Medicaid in 47 states, and by most private insurance providers. To be sure of coverage, families should, of course, check with their employer or health insurance provider. If the patient is eligible for Medicare, will there be any additional expense to be paid? The Medicare Hospice Benefit covers the full scope of medical and support services for a life-limiting illness. Hospice care also supports the family and loved ones of the person through a variety of services. This benefit covers almost all aspects of hospice care with little expense to the patient or family. Can a hospice patient who shows signs of recovery be returned to regular medical treatment? Certainly. If the patient’s condition improves and the disease seems to be in remission, patients can be discharged from hospice and return to aggressive therapy or go on about their daily life. If the discharged patient should later need to return to hospice care, Medicare and most private insurance will allow additional coverage for this purpose. What does the hospice admission process involve? One of the first things the hospice program will do is contact the patient’s physician to make sure he or she agrees that hospice care is appropriate for this patient at this time. (Most hospices have medical staff available to help patients who have no physician.) The patient will be asked to sign consent and insurance forms. These are similar to the forms patients sign when they enter a hospital. The form Medicare patients sign also tells how electing the Medicare hospice benefit affects other Medicare coverage. Is there any special equipment or changes I must make in my home before hospice care begins? Your hospice provider will assess your needs, recommend any equipment, and help make arrangements to obtain any necessary equipment. Often the need for equipment is minimal at first and increases as the disease progresses. In general, hospice will assist in any way it can to make home care as convenient, clean and safe as possible.\n\nWhat is hospice? - Hospice is a coordinated program of palliative and supportive care with the focus on comfort care rather than curative care for those individuals diagnosed with a terminal illness. What is palliative care? - Palliative care is relief of pain: the treatment and relief of mental and physical pain without curing the causes, especially in patients suffering from a terminal illness. What does “terminally ill” mean? - A medical prognosis of approximately six months or less if the disease runs its natural course. Common examples of terminal illnesses are:\n- End-stage Cardiopulmonary Conditions\n- End-stage Heart Disease\n- End-stage Lung Disease\n- End-stage Liver Disease\n- End-stage Renal Disease\n- Cancer (All Types)\n- Neurological Conditions\n- ALS (Lou Gehrig’s Disease)\n- End-stage HIV\/AIDS\n- End-stage Dementia\n- End-stage Alzheimer’s Disease\n- Other Disorders\/Diagnoses\nHow is hospice care paid for? - Medicare Part A\n- Most commercial and private insurance companies\nWe view each situation as unique and will review the benefit plan with you individually in order to maximize your hospice benefit and insurance coverage. What is covered under the hospice program? - Staff services including nurses, social workers, physicians, chaplains, hospice aides, volunteers, etc. - Medications related to the hospice diagnosis as well as comfort medications\n- Durable Medical Equipment (DME) such as wheelchairs, walkers and oxygen, as they pertain to terminal illness\n- Medical supplies such as catheters and bandages, as they pertain to terminal illness\n- Many additional services including bereavement and counseling services\nWill I have to change doctors? - We believe that a continued relationship with your primary care physician is important; therefore, the patient or family member may choose to continue their physician relationship or have one of our specialized hospice physicians oversee your care. How long can I remain on hospice? - The hospice benefit will continue to cover palliative and comfort care for an individual with a terminal illness for an initial 90-day period, a subsequent 90-day period, and indefinite subsequent 60-day periods as determined by the hospice medical director, and as long as you continue to meet the requirements of the hospice benefit. Will I have to stop all of my medications? - Our hospice views each case individually. We will work with your physician and pharmacy to determine which medications we will cover under the Medicare Hospice Benefit, which ones will be covered under your Part D plan, and which medications are determined to be no longer medically necessary and if continued, would become the financial responsibility of the patient. How will hospice manage my pain? - Our hospice team works with the patient and family to determine the needs for pain management. Each situation is individualized, with the goal being to provide the most effective pain relief. Do I have to stay home all the time? - You do not have to be homebound to receive hospice services. We encourage our patients to enjoy life as much as possible. Does hospice provide sitters? - The hospice benefit does not include sitters. The hospice may provide volunteers to stay with you for short periods of time if appropriate. Our hospice can provide you with a variety of resources listing sitter agencies who may be of service to you. The sitters are not employees of the hospice agency and therefore are not the responsibility of the hospice agency. If I live in a nursing home, can I receive hospice care? - Yes, our hospice provides hospice care where ever you live. This includes home, independent living facilities, assisted living facilities and nursing homes. Is it necessary that I have a DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) Order to receive hospice? - It is not necessary to have a DNR; however, our hospice will work with the patient and family to obtain a LaPOST, a living will, power of attorney and\/or DNR, as necessary. When is it time to get hospice? - It is time for hospice when all measures to cure the patient of the terminal illness have been exhausted and when the physician declares the patient has a prognosis of six months or less, if the disease runs its natural course. You can call us and get more information at any time. Click here to CONTACT US. How do I get hospice? - Your doctor may make the referral or you can request that someone from our hospice meet with you to give you information about the hospice benefit. Once an initial meeting is established, our hospice representative may contact your physician regarding your needs and request an approval for hospice services.\n\n- Are you underinsured for your circumstances? - How to Build Sustainable Wealth\n- How to Maintain Our Body\n- Enhancing Resilience as We Age\n- The Body After 60: Overcoming Barriers to Exercise\n- The best herbs to grow for beginners\n- Foods you had no idea you could freeze\n- Is celebrating your 100th birthday no longer a dream? - Medicare and Medicaid: Dual eligibility\n- Summer Workouts for Your Dose of Vitamin D\n- What’s Keeping You from Losing Weight? - Music and Your Wellbeing\n- Your NEW Social Security Statement\n- How to Dispose of Unused Medications\n- Smart Home Systems: Promoting a Comfortable Environment for Seniors\n- Aging and Our Body’s Ability to Heal Itself\n- Keeping Health Insurance After a Layoff\n- Waking Up to the Impact of Insomnia\n- How Life Insurance Benefits Women\n- What experts say about raising the retirement age\n- Coverage for healthcare treatment denied?

Partly because STP is a mix of so many varied experiences that every week is different to the previous one, and partly because my own understanding of my specialism keeps evolving as I move through these experiences. When I first applied for this course, I thought I had a reasonable understanding of what cancer genomics was. But now I see how naive I was and that three years is not anywhere near enough time to fully comprehend this very diverse and quickly developing area of science. So summarising it all in a few paragraphs will be a challenge but… let’s give it a go! Critical Care Science in the Wider Context\nCritical Care Science (CCS) is one of the smaller STP specialisms but deals with one of the most complex patient populations. Critical care patients range from elective cardiac surgery patients to major trauma and acute\/chronic medical conditions. Critical care refers to specialised care for patients with life-threatening conditions; typically compromising of one or more organs that are failing. This level of care may be delivered in A+E, Intensive Care, High Dependency or specialist wards, e.g. long term ventilation. While a lot of the STP specialisms focus on a particular organ system or on a particular grouping of investigative techniques, the skills of CCS cover a holistic approach to clinical care, incorporating all areas of medicine and technology. Genetic counsellors see individuals and families to discuss genetic conditions that are present, or are thought to be present, in their family. Information about an individual’s personal medical history and their family history is taken into account when determining the likelihood of a genetic condition running in a family.\n\nLearning to live with a chronic illness is an exhausting challenge for everyone involved. From diagnosis until either the illness resolves or the client’s life ends, that individual and family must make every decision and every move with the chronic illness in mind. ;\nThe social worker’s role is many times fairly limited. It is often a matter of following the client and seeing that their basic needs are being met. At times, it does take on the role of sleuth when the social worker is able to go in search of resources to help pay for special needs for everything from prostheses to new treatments. At the very least, it is to help the client and their family to hold on to hope. Interview an individual who has a chronic illness. With the individual’s permission, interview them about what it is like to live with a chronic illness, the most difficult parts of being chronically ill, how they manage their illness, what aspects—if any—frighten them, what kind of social support and family support they have, how willing they would be to try new treatment methods, and which social worker stands out most in their mind (good or bad) and why. In a 5-6-minute video reflect on the following (Asking for a transcript not video recording):\n· Describe the patient and their chronic illness. What makes it difficult? How is it managed? · How did it feel for you to talk candidly with an individual about their illness? · Who would you say was more uncomfortable talking about it—you or the person you were interviewing? · How informed was in the individual about their illness and the treatments and prognosis? · How supported did this individual feel from the community, and how did that support change from before they became ill? · What insights did you gain from this experience that you will take into the field as a social worker to help when you work with clients with chronic illnesses?

We all know how difficult it is to run into medical issues. We have to figure out where do we go to for a hospital, face high doctor consultancy costs and numerous additional fees that occur with different types of cases (especially emergency ones). But there is a way to help yourself prepare for these types of situations through what most people know as an “HMO.”\nAn HMO, or health maintenance organization, acts as a service for you to access its list of available doctors and clinics and cover most (if not all) of your medical-related costs. In exchange for this service, the HMO charges a yearly premium or fee. As long as you use their list of accredited doctors and clinics, you can find your medical needs more or less covered and settled. An HMO can serve as one of the benefits for employees who work in private companies. A company may offer it as a perk by covering the whole cost of the HMO per employee (no salary deduction). Some companies even cover the HMO of at least one dependent per employee.ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nHow does this differ from health insurance or PhilHealth?CONTINUE READING BELOWRecommended Videos\nType of medical coverage: HMO\nService provider: HMO companies (Medicard, Maxicare, Pacific Cross, etc.) Estimated cost: P500 to upwards of P60,000\nStandard benefits: Outpatient, inpatient, emergency, preventive (only with accredited\/associated hospitals\/clinics of the HMO)\nTransmittal of financial assistance: The accredited hospital or clinic will charge your bill against the consumable limit or amount provided by the HMO.

Think of your standard consultation with your doctor where they prescribe certain medication — that is an outpatient treatment. These are services that require the individual to stay in the hospital for a period of 24 hours or more, with any additional in-hospital needs included. Inpatient services are applicable to situations in which quarantine or extended stay is required for monitoring, as well as situations where certain procedures are needed that take longer than one day to execute. These often fall under situations wherein an individual utilizes the emergency room of various hospitals. Depending on the case, these emergency visits can be covered by your medical plan.ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nHow to decide on the HMO you need\nThe goal of these various medical coverage plans are to make your next medical situation as easy as possible. Health insurance provides the largest amount of benefits (albeit with comparatively high premiums), and PhilHealth provides the most standard service of medical discount on a basic premium (though limited in coverage). An HMO then stands as a comprehensive medical plan that can work towards what you need the most as an individual based on cost\/premium, coverage, and healthcare providers. (If you are employed and HMO is one of the benefits, the company decides of the HMO.) The cost of HMOs is varied — these prices can be as low as P500 for a year’s coverage up to P15,000 in medical consumable benefits.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:9806b940-697d-46a2-8f9c-db3f030b69b6>"]},{"passage":"Being on workcover is a nightmare! Dealing with your injury,the complex workcover system, your employer, the WorkCover agent, rehabilitation agents, doctors and even lawyers can be mind boggling and very stressful! Here we share few tips that can help you survive WorkCover! Dealing with your injury- especially a permanent injury- and its after-effects can be extremely stressful. Negotiating your way around a very complex WorkCover system, dealing with your employer, the WorkCover agent, rehabilitation agents, doctors, so called “independent medical examiners” and even lawyers can be mind boggling and extremely stressful! Below are a few tips and tricks that can help you survive the WorkCover nightmare!Focus on your health and recovery\nYour highest priority should always be your health and to maximise your physical and\/or psychological recovery.WorkCover must pay for all reasonable treatment costs. We strongly believe that the most important issue is to ensure that you are getting the best quality medical treatment possible. Related blog articles\n- surviving workcover some more tips\n- workcover survival guide for injured workers\n- on being on workcover and what it’s like\nWhen you are seriously injured, you will have to make many important decisions about your future. To make the right decisions it will be critical to understand as much as you possibly can about the structure of WorkCover benefits, for example, how they interact with your other employment entitlements, and what all your entitlements really are. WorkCover is an extremely complex system! The Act of Parliament which governs WorkCover alone is several hundred pages long and quite complicated. Trying to understand just what WorkCover does and does not provide is really important. There are many resources available to help you with this task. The most detailed information, apart from the Act itself, is on the WorkSafe website which contains a very detailed publication called the ‘Online Claims Manual‘. This contains detailed instructions from WorkCover to its agents on how to handle claims. It also includes very detailed information about the calculation and payment of WorkCover benefits. Remember this information is written from WorkCover’s perspective only. Nonetheless this can be a useful resource for people who want detailed information.Try to deal as best you can with WorkCover\nDealing with WorkCover and -especially- your case manager can be extremely stressful.Following a few simple guidelines can make dealing with WorkCover, and your case manager (and rehab providers) a tad easier. - The most important thing is that you keep good, written records. For example, if you want to claim travel expenses you need to submit details of all your trips to and from doctors, incl train, bus, tram, taxi and parking receipts. If there is an argument about your weekly payments because WorkCover feel you are not looking for work, keeping a record of all your attempts to obtain work can put you in a far better position. - We advice all injured workers to only communicate\/correspond in writing, either via email or via letter\/fax. You do have the right to refuse telephone contact and you also have the right to request that all correspondence\/communications go through your legal representative, one of your doctors or an advocate. You can even put a “restraining” order on your harassing, bullying and\/or intimidating case manager (see our workcover tips collection for sample letters). - It’s also very important that you keep a copy of all your documents. For example, when you receive a certificate of incapacity, the original should be provided to your employer but ensure you make a copy for your own records. - Ask under the Freedom of Information Act or the Workers Compensation Act, for a copy of all your medical reports, including independent medical examination reports. - When submitting your medical certificates ensure that you complete the section on the back of the certificate about your work activities. If you don’t it will delay your payments and the form will be sent back to you. It may also be useful to try and ensure that your certificates expire on a Saturday or Sunday to make it easier for WorkCover or your employer to calculate your weekly entitlement. This enables weekly benefits to be paid in whole weeks. - Sometimes (well dare we say “often’) the decisions that a case manager makes can be extremely frustrating. Losing your cool can backfire as you will run the risk of being type cast as difficult or as suffering from a psychological problem!","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:bcd588fa-16a2-478c-8ee9-baad8ee759b6>"]},{"passage":"Recovery after Critical Care Booklet\nIt is recognised that recovering from critical illness does not end when you are discharged from Critical Care.

What specific assistance does hospice provide home-based patients? Hospice patients are cared for by a team consisting of a physician, nurse practitioner, a nurse, social workers, certified nursing assistants, clergy, therapists, and volunteers. Each one provides assistance based on his or her own area of expertise. In addition, hospices provide medications, supplies, equipment, and other services related to the terminal illness. Does hospice do anything to make death come sooner? Hospice neither hastens nor postpones dying. Just as doctors and midwives lend support and expertise during the time of child birth, hospice provides its presence and specialized knowledge during the dying process. Is hospice care covered by insurance? Hospice coverage is widely available. It is provided by Medicare nationwide, by Medicaid in 47 states, and by most private insurance providers. To be sure of coverage, families should, of course, check with their employer or health insurance provider. If the patient is eligible for Medicare, will there be any additional expense to be paid? The Medicare Hospice Benefit covers the full scope of medical and support services for a life-limiting illness. Hospice care also supports the family and loved ones of the person through a variety of services. This benefit covers almost all aspects of hospice care with little expense to the patient or family. Can a hospice patient who shows signs of recovery be returned to regular medical treatment? Certainly. If the patient’s condition improves and the disease seems to be in remission, patients can be discharged from hospice and return to aggressive therapy or go on about their daily life. If the discharged patient should later need to return to hospice care, Medicare and most private insurance will allow additional coverage for this purpose. What does the hospice admission process involve? One of the first things the hospice program will do is contact the patient’s physician to make sure he or she agrees that hospice care is appropriate for this patient at this time. (Most hospices have medical staff available to help patients who have no physician.) The patient will be asked to sign consent and insurance forms. These are similar to the forms patients sign when they enter a hospital. The form Medicare patients sign also tells how electing the Medicare hospice benefit affects other Medicare coverage. Is there any special equipment or changes I must make in my home before hospice care begins? Your hospice provider will assess your needs, recommend any equipment, and help make arrangements to obtain any necessary equipment. Often the need for equipment is minimal at first and increases as the disease progresses. In general, hospice will assist in any way it can to make home care as convenient, clean and safe as possible.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:9f005b0f-4523-4054-b1b8-744f12b9b2c3>"]},{"passage":"What is hospice? - Hospice is a coordinated program of palliative and supportive care with the focus on comfort care rather than curative care for those individuals diagnosed with a terminal illness. What is palliative care? - Palliative care is relief of pain: the treatment and relief of mental and physical pain without curing the causes, especially in patients suffering from a terminal illness. What does “terminally ill” mean? - A medical prognosis of approximately six months or less if the disease runs its natural course. Common examples of terminal illnesses are:\n- End-stage Cardiopulmonary Conditions\n- End-stage Heart Disease\n- End-stage Lung Disease\n- End-stage Liver Disease\n- End-stage Renal Disease\n- Cancer (All Types)\n- Neurological Conditions\n- ALS (Lou Gehrig’s Disease)\n- End-stage HIV\/AIDS\n- End-stage Dementia\n- End-stage Alzheimer’s Disease\n- Other Disorders\/Diagnoses\nHow is hospice care paid for? - Medicare Part A\n- Most commercial and private insurance companies\nWe view each situation as unique and will review the benefit plan with you individually in order to maximize your hospice benefit and insurance coverage. What is covered under the hospice program? - Staff services including nurses, social workers, physicians, chaplains, hospice aides, volunteers, etc. - Medications related to the hospice diagnosis as well as comfort medications\n- Durable Medical Equipment (DME) such as wheelchairs, walkers and oxygen, as they pertain to terminal illness\n- Medical supplies such as catheters and bandages, as they pertain to terminal illness\n- Many additional services including bereavement and counseling services\nWill I have to change doctors? - We believe that a continued relationship with your primary care physician is important; therefore, the patient or family member may choose to continue their physician relationship or have one of our specialized hospice physicians oversee your care. How long can I remain on hospice? - The hospice benefit will continue to cover palliative and comfort care for an individual with a terminal illness for an initial 90-day period, a subsequent 90-day period, and indefinite subsequent 60-day periods as determined by the hospice medical director, and as long as you continue to meet the requirements of the hospice benefit. Will I have to stop all of my medications? - Our hospice views each case individually. We will work with your physician and pharmacy to determine which medications we will cover under the Medicare Hospice Benefit, which ones will be covered under your Part D plan, and which medications are determined to be no longer medically necessary and if continued, would become the financial responsibility of the patient. How will hospice manage my pain? - Our hospice team works with the patient and family to determine the needs for pain management. Each situation is individualized, with the goal being to provide the most effective pain relief. Do I have to stay home all the time? - You do not have to be homebound to receive hospice services. We encourage our patients to enjoy life as much as possible. Does hospice provide sitters? - The hospice benefit does not include sitters. The hospice may provide volunteers to stay with you for short periods of time if appropriate. Our hospice can provide you with a variety of resources listing sitter agencies who may be of service to you. The sitters are not employees of the hospice agency and therefore are not the responsibility of the hospice agency. If I live in a nursing home, can I receive hospice care? - Yes, our hospice provides hospice care where ever you live. This includes home, independent living facilities, assisted living facilities and nursing homes. Is it necessary that I have a DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) Order to receive hospice? - It is not necessary to have a DNR; however, our hospice will work with the patient and family to obtain a LaPOST, a living will, power of attorney and\/or DNR, as necessary. When is it time to get hospice? - It is time for hospice when all measures to cure the patient of the terminal illness have been exhausted and when the physician declares the patient has a prognosis of six months or less, if the disease runs its natural course. You can call us and get more information at any time. Click here to CONTACT US. How do I get hospice? - Your doctor may make the referral or you can request that someone from our hospice meet with you to give you information about the hospice benefit. Once an initial meeting is established, our hospice representative may contact your physician regarding your needs and request an approval for hospice services.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:b23f1eb5-d1be-40bd-bc40-ae5807ae7718>"]},{"passage":"- Are you underinsured for your circumstances? - How to Build Sustainable Wealth\n- How to Maintain Our Body\n- Enhancing Resilience as We Age\n- The Body After 60: Overcoming Barriers to Exercise\n- The best herbs to grow for beginners\n- Foods you had no idea you could freeze\n- Is celebrating your 100th birthday no longer a dream? - Medicare and Medicaid: Dual eligibility\n- Summer Workouts for Your Dose of Vitamin D\n- What’s Keeping You from Losing Weight? - Music and Your Wellbeing\n- Your NEW Social Security Statement\n- How to Dispose of Unused Medications\n- Smart Home Systems: Promoting a Comfortable Environment for Seniors\n- Aging and Our Body’s Ability to Heal Itself\n- Keeping Health Insurance After a Layoff\n- Waking Up to the Impact of Insomnia\n- How Life Insurance Benefits Women\n- What experts say about raising the retirement age\n- Coverage for healthcare treatment denied?

Partly because STP is a mix of so many varied experiences that every week is different to the previous one, and partly because my own understanding of my specialism keeps evolving as I move through these experiences. When I first applied for this course, I thought I had a reasonable understanding of what cancer genomics was. But now I see how naive I was and that three years is not anywhere near enough time to fully comprehend this very diverse and quickly developing area of science. So summarising it all in a few paragraphs will be a challenge but… let’s give it a go! Critical Care Science in the Wider Context\nCritical Care Science (CCS) is one of the smaller STP specialisms but deals with one of the most complex patient populations. Critical care patients range from elective cardiac surgery patients to major trauma and acute\/chronic medical conditions. Critical care refers to specialised care for patients with life-threatening conditions; typically compromising of one or more organs that are failing. This level of care may be delivered in A+E, Intensive Care, High Dependency or specialist wards, e.g. long term ventilation. While a lot of the STP specialisms focus on a particular organ system or on a particular grouping of investigative techniques, the skills of CCS cover a holistic approach to clinical care, incorporating all areas of medicine and technology. Genetic counsellors see individuals and families to discuss genetic conditions that are present, or are thought to be present, in their family. Information about an individual’s personal medical history and their family history is taken into account when determining the likelihood of a genetic condition running in a family.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:0be89ca1-7f33-4f68-bd90-3f219782383e>"]},{"passage":"Learning to live with a chronic illness is an exhausting challenge for everyone involved. From diagnosis until either the illness resolves or the client’s life ends, that individual and family must make every decision and every move with the chronic illness in mind. ;\nThe social worker’s role is many times fairly limited. It is often a matter of following the client and seeing that their basic needs are being met. At times, it does take on the role of sleuth when the social worker is able to go in search of resources to help pay for special needs for everything from prostheses to new treatments. At the very least, it is to help the client and their family to hold on to hope. Interview an individual who has a chronic illness. With the individual’s permission, interview them about what it is like to live with a chronic illness, the most difficult parts of being chronically ill, how they manage their illness, what aspects—if any—frighten them, what kind of social support and family support they have, how willing they would be to try new treatment methods, and which social worker stands out most in their mind (good or bad) and why. In a 5-6-minute video reflect on the following (Asking for a transcript not video recording):\n· Describe the patient and their chronic illness. What makes it difficult? How is it managed? · How did it feel for you to talk candidly with an individual about their illness? · Who would you say was more uncomfortable talking about it—you or the person you were interviewing? · How informed was in the individual about their illness and the treatments and prognosis? · How supported did this individual feel from the community, and how did that support change from before they became ill? · What insights did you gain from this experience that you will take into the field as a social worker to help when you work with clients with chronic illnesses?
