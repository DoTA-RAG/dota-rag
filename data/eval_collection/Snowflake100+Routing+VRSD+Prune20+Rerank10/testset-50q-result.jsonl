Every piece of Polish pottery is handmade and hand-decorated using stamps and brushes. It comes in hundreds of shapes, with patterns ranging from classic dots and “peacock eyes” to more intricate “artistic” or “UNIKAT” patterns.

Caring for your pottery\nThe high quality of the clay combined with the manufacturing process make Polish pottery extremely durable. Fired at over 1200°C, it is classed as stoneware and safe to use in dishwashers, microwaves and fridges. This makes Polish pottery suitable for everyday use at home and in catering. All dishes with a grooved bottom are also safe to use in traditional gas or electric ovens up to 280°C, as well as on glass, ceramic and electric hobs.\n\nSo what is Polish Pottery anyway?

It really does speak for itself.\n\nmaterial, design such as shape and style, etc. - its decorations, such as patterns, colors of patterns, slipped (glazing) or unslipped decoration\n- evidence of type of use. The Six fabrics of Kalibangan is a good example of fabric analysis. Body (or clay body) is a term for the main pottery form of a piece, underneath any glaze or decoration. The main ingredient of the body is clay. There are several materials that are referred to as clay. The properties which make them different include: Plasticity, the malleability of the body; the extent to which they will absorb water after firing; and shrinkage, the extent of reduction in size of a body as water is removed. Different clay bodies also differ in the way in which they respond when fired in the kiln. A clay body can be decorated before or after firing. Prior to some shaping processes, clay must be prepared. Each of these different clays is composed of different types and amounts of minerals that determine the characteristics of resulting pottery. There can be regional variations in the properties of raw materials used for the production of pottery, and these can lead to wares that are unique in character to a locality. It is common for clays and other materials to be mixed to produce clay bodies suited to specific purposes. A common component of clay bodies is the mineral kaolinite. Other minerals in the clay, such as feldspar, act as fluxes which lower the vitrification temperature of bodies. Following is a list of different types of clay used for pottery. - Kaolin, is sometimes referred to as china clay because it was first used in China. Used for porcelain. - Ball clay: An extremely plastic, fine grained sedimentary clay, which may contain some organic matter. Small amounts can be added to porcelain bodies to increase plasticity. - Fire clay: A clay having a slightly lower percentage of fluxes than kaolin, but usually quite plastic. It is highly heat resistant form of clay which can be combined with other clays to increase the firing temperature and may be used as an ingredient to make stoneware type bodies. - Stoneware clay: Suitable for creating stoneware. Has many of the characteristics between fire clay and ball clay, having finer grain, like ball clay but is more heat resistant like fire clays. - Common red clay and shale clay have vegetable and ferric oxide impurities which make them useful for bricks, but are generally unsatisfactory for pottery except under special conditions of a particular deposit. - Bentonite: An extremely plastic clay which can be added in small quantities to short clay to increase the plasticity. Production of pottery includes following 3 stages:\n- making clay body, i.e. paste or putty. - shaping and moulding\n- firing or baking\n- decorating, such as glazing (slipping), paining, etc. Pottery can be shaped by a range of methods that include:\n- Hand-building: This is the earliest forming method. Wares can be constructed by hand from coils of clay, combining flat slabs of clay, or pinching solid balls of clay or some combination of these. Parts of hand-built vessels are often joined together with the aid of slip, an aqueous suspension of clay body and water. A clay body can be decorated before or after firing. Prior to some shaping processes, clay must be prepared, such as tablewares, although some studio potters find hand-building more conducive to create one-of-a-kind works of art. - The potter's wheel: In a process called \"throwing\" (coming from the Old English word thrownاا which means to twist or turn, ) a ball of clay is placed in the center of a turntable, called the wheel-head, which the potter rotates with a stick, with foot power or with a variable-speed electric motor. - During the process of throwing, the wheel rotates while the solid ball of soft clay is pressed, squeezed and pulled gently upwards and outwards into a hollow shape.\n\nIdentifying unmarked pottery can be a chore. There is no single book or website that will always provide you with definitive answers. Amateur pottery owners or collectors have to correlate information from multiple sources in order to identify an unmarked piece of pottery. To do so, start with a few basic elements of the piece itself, and then turn to references or local experts who may be able to fill in the gaps. Things You'll Need\nLocal auction houses\nFlea markets or art markets\nPick up the piece and note the width of the clay in relation to the weight of the object. American pottery is often thicker than that of other countries and weighs more. Experts say that American pottery, for example, tends to have a \"heavy bottom.\" Native American pottery also often makes use of red and beige clays. Note the color of the clay in places that are unglazed. Frankoma pottery, for example, is made of red or pink clay, while Ada pottery sports yellow or beige clay. Narrow down the clay type and color, the weight of the piece and the color of the glaze. Come up with a couple of options for potential potters, and then use an online search engine to obtain more information and possible matches. Use phrases that are descriptive. Observe any designs painted on the piece itself. Moriage china, for example, often features pastel colors and intricate floral designs laid in with small ribbons of clay. A willow piece from China will picture a blue-and-white willow, orange or apple tree with two birds. It was possibly include a river, boats and people on a bridge. Use online commercial sites to look for sellers offering pieces similar to yours, since they may identify yours for you. Scout flea markets and art markets as well for other local people selling similar pieces who might be able to help you identify yours. Look at the bottom of your piece of pottery for a design that may indicate the pieces origin, even without the potter's name or the factory name. Indentations in the bottom of the piece, allowing it to sit flat, may also be indicative of its origin. Discoloration or specific coloring on the bottom of the piece may as well. Even with multiple sources, you may not end up finding a concrete origin for your piece of pottery.\n\nTo understand the variations between ceramic and porcelain all you need is the definition of each. Whereas ceramic is a general time period that additionally includes porcelain, porcelain is a ceramic product that is made a bit otherwise than other ceramic products. The class of ceramics consists of porcelain but additionally clay, bone and different types of pottery. What additional differentiates the two is their composition. Porcelain is seen as a more refined type of ceramics and it’s composed of white clay and petuntse, which is a type of feldspar, found only in China. The merchandise are heated to a higher degree than common ceramic dishes or pottery. By heating these to over 2600 degrees the clay takes on a glasslike quality. Most collectors can tell just by sight and feel which is which. The ceramics often has a bit more within the weight department than does the porcelain. Ceramic figurines are additionally identified for their grainy textures. One certain-fire strategy to inform which is which is by sounding. This is the process the place you tap on the thing and listen for the pitch of the sound. The porcelains have a higher pitch. The Chinese perfected the making of porcelain particularly what is referred to, as positive “China” century’s ago. It took Europe about one other 800 years to make their first firing of anything comparable to what was coming out of China. Figurines and dishes from the early intervals of China’s porcelain history normally command a hefty price. As to which is healthier all of it depends largely on the buyer and the aim of the piece.

Production of pottery includes following 3 stages:\n- making clay body, i.e. paste or putty. - shaping and moulding\n- firing or baking\n- decorating, such as glazing (slipping), paining, etc. Pottery can be shaped by a range of methods that include:\n- Hand-building: This is the earliest forming method. Wares can be constructed by hand from coils of clay, combining flat slabs of clay, or pinching solid balls of clay or some combination of these. Parts of hand-built vessels are often joined together with the aid of slip, an aqueous suspension of clay body and water. A clay body can be decorated before or after firing. Prior to some shaping processes, clay must be prepared, such as tablewares, although some studio potters find hand-building more conducive to create one-of-a-kind works of art. - The potter's wheel: In a process called \"throwing\" (coming from the Old English word thrownاا which means to twist or turn, ) a ball of clay is placed in the center of a turntable, called the wheel-head, which the potter rotates with a stick, with foot power or with a variable-speed electric motor. - During the process of throwing, the wheel rotates while the solid ball of soft clay is pressed, squeezed and pulled gently upwards and outwards into a hollow shape.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:3fc6b15f-c3b5-4b3f-8c6f-bbf05a84d024>"]},{"passage":"Identifying unmarked pottery can be a chore. There is no single book or website that will always provide you with definitive answers. Amateur pottery owners or collectors have to correlate information from multiple sources in order to identify an unmarked piece of pottery. To do so, start with a few basic elements of the piece itself, and then turn to references or local experts who may be able to fill in the gaps. Things You'll Need\nLocal auction houses\nFlea markets or art markets\nPick up the piece and note the width of the clay in relation to the weight of the object. American pottery is often thicker than that of other countries and weighs more. Experts say that American pottery, for example, tends to have a \"heavy bottom.\" Native American pottery also often makes use of red and beige clays. Note the color of the clay in places that are unglazed. Frankoma pottery, for example, is made of red or pink clay, while Ada pottery sports yellow or beige clay. Narrow down the clay type and color, the weight of the piece and the color of the glaze. Come up with a couple of options for potential potters, and then use an online search engine to obtain more information and possible matches. Use phrases that are descriptive. Observe any designs painted on the piece itself. Moriage china, for example, often features pastel colors and intricate floral designs laid in with small ribbons of clay. A willow piece from China will picture a blue-and-white willow, orange or apple tree with two birds. It was possibly include a river, boats and people on a bridge. Use online commercial sites to look for sellers offering pieces similar to yours, since they may identify yours for you. Scout flea markets and art markets as well for other local people selling similar pieces who might be able to help you identify yours. Look at the bottom of your piece of pottery for a design that may indicate the pieces origin, even without the potter's name or the factory name. Indentations in the bottom of the piece, allowing it to sit flat, may also be indicative of its origin. Discoloration or specific coloring on the bottom of the piece may as well. Even with multiple sources, you may not end up finding a concrete origin for your piece of pottery.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:9d5ab99d-3975-4bcb-890b-55d686f61b0b>"]},{"passage":"To understand the variations between ceramic and porcelain all you need is the definition of each. Whereas ceramic is a general time period that additionally includes porcelain, porcelain is a ceramic product that is made a bit otherwise than other ceramic products. The class of ceramics consists of porcelain but additionally clay, bone and different types of pottery. What additional differentiates the two is their composition. Porcelain is seen as a more refined type of ceramics and it’s composed of white clay and petuntse, which is a type of feldspar, found only in China. The merchandise are heated to a higher degree than common ceramic dishes or pottery. By heating these to over 2600 degrees the clay takes on a glasslike quality. Most collectors can tell just by sight and feel which is which. The ceramics often has a bit more within the weight department than does the porcelain. Ceramic figurines are additionally identified for their grainy textures. One certain-fire strategy to inform which is which is by sounding. This is the process the place you tap on the thing and listen for the pitch of the sound. The porcelains have a higher pitch. The Chinese perfected the making of porcelain particularly what is referred to, as positive “China” century’s ago. It took Europe about one other 800 years to make their first firing of anything comparable to what was coming out of China. Figurines and dishes from the early intervals of China’s porcelain history normally command a hefty price. As to which is healthier all of it depends largely on the buyer and the aim of the piece. There are collections of each which are very expensive. If you want to begin your personal collection read to get concepts on tips on how to tell the distinction yourself. 1. If when held as much as a light supply you can see the shadow of the thing placed behind the figurine then it is porcelain. Porcelain has a translucent quality that different forms of ceramics lack. 2. Is the figurine’s surface smooth or grainy. Whether it is grainy it is not porcelain. Porcelain feels more like a glass surface, an egg at worst. Whether or not its a porcelain figurine or a ceramic figurine, you will enjoy it if it is made with care and quality. Ultimately, like anything else, it comes all the way down to what makes you the most blissful to look at and cherish. 3. Is the figurine of a delicate nature? One of the most interesting properties of porcelain is it fragile nature. Different types of ceramic are quite a bit more durable and thicker. 4. Discover the gloss or sheen on the object. Porcelain is a glossier surface. It appears to be like prefer it has been polished. Beautiful figurines are an important addition to your home, regardless of what they’re made of.

A photo flight is a flight in a helicopter or airplane with a photographer on board, taking pictures of properties, events, construction sites or other projects. So why not just use a drone? That seems to be just so much easier, right? Well, a drone is very lightweight, and can stay in the air only for a limited amount of time. Winds can be challenging for a drone because of its weight. There are also restrictions on what you can do with a drone. You cannot operate above a certain altitude without FAA approval, and you cannot operate close to certain airports. A helicopter or airplane is able to stay in the air for hours, if needed. An aircraft can cover a way bigger area and give the photographer better flexibility. There are specific applications where a drone makes way more sense than a helicopter or airplane. Especially if you are operating close to the ground. So both have their advantages and disadvantages. How does a photo flight typically work? We typically start with a ground briefing with the photographer and the pilot. This is to make sure both know exactly what is expected and what is of importance to the photographer or camera man and the project. This is of even more importance if a video or movie is shot. It will help keep the cost down, since we want to keep the time that we are in the helicopter actually flying as focused and short as possible. Also important is the safety briefing. No loose objects in the aircraft. We try to fulfill the needs of the photographer but it is of the highest importance that the flight is safe. What projects have we done in the past? We have worked on film and photo projects including Music Videos, Vehicle promotion videos and lots of photography projects. Some of those include Vineyards, buildings, marathons, crop fields, construction sites and more. If you have any questions or need details on how we can help you with a certain project, please don’t hesitate to contact us.\n\nPost new question\nDoes anyone use a drone here whenever you travel inside india? is it really necessary to take permission before flying a drone in rural or tourist places inside india?

Any leads?\n\nFlying a Drone in Iceland\nAs the recent eruption on Fagradalsfjall has proven, drones are capable of capturing absolutely incredible shots. Even before the eruption, Iceland was a feast for drone pilots who would come from all over the world looking for stunning content for their Instagram feed, and they would not leave disappointed. You might be planning to do the same? Honestly, who could blame you? So, you are probably wondering what the rules are regarding safety and where you can fly freely? Well, look no further, here is a useful guide regarding flying a drone in Iceland. Which Areas are Safe for Flying a Drone in Iceland? The great news is that, when it comes to flying a drone in Iceland, you may do so freely in most parts of the country. However, as with everywhere, there are certain rules are regulations concerning safe and legal drone use. So, it is best to be prepared. Here are the main rules to follow\nIf you plan to fly for commercial purposes, then you need to register your drone. If its just for fun, then no need to worry! Your drone must weigh no more than 3kg in urban areas, and no more then 25kg in rural areas. You are permitted to fly your drone no more than 120 meters from the ground.You cannot fly any closed than 2km to the international airport, and no more than 1.5km to any other airport in the country. Please ensure that you fly no closer than 150 meters to public and private buildings in rural areas with express permission from the property owner. Also, please ensure you do not fly any closer than 150 meters to public buildings and 50 km to private buildings in urban areas without permission from the property owner. Never fly over crowds of people\nNever disturb wildlife with your drone. Animals such as birds, horses, seals, reindeer, etc are to be left to behave naturally. Drones can be frightening to them, and can cause panicked and unnatural behaviour. Drone flights in all national parks, protected areas, nature reserves and monuments are not permitted. These areas include Vatnajökull National Park, Þingvellir National Park, Snæfellsjökull National Park, Dyrhólaey, Látrabjarg, Hornstrandir, Geysir, Gullfoss, etc.For commercial drone photography, you can apply for an exemption permit to some of the restrictions mentioned above. Flying a Drone in Iceland’s National Parks\nThe national parks of Iceland are off limits for drone use, except on special circumstances. The same is also true for many protected areas of interest around the country. The reason for this is to protect fragile and sensitive nature, animal life and for the safety and enjoyment of other people. For example, places such as Skógafoss waterfall, Dyrhólaey nature reserve and Látrabjarg have a protected status because of nesting birds. The use of drones can disturb the birds and can lead to eggs or chicks being abandoned. This can then lead to a reduction in numbers. There are also many seal colonies around Iceland, and areas that seals simply like to visit, such as Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon. Drones can drive them away from these areas, and they may never return if they do not feel safe. Skógafoss is a very tempting place to film with your drone, and if you film from the left of the waterfall then this is perfectly fine, but once you encroach on the monument area then drones are not permitted. Can I Get Special Permission for Flying a Drone in Iceland’s National Parks? Yes, you can. Provided your footage is to be used for commercial purposes. You can apply for a special permit, where you can discuss your plans. Upon granting of a permit, you will receive expert guidance on where you can fly, at what time of day, etc. You can apply to for a permit in Vatnajökull National Park, Þingvellir National Park and you can also apply to the Environment Agency of Iceland for permission to fly in Snæfellsjökull National Park and all other protected areas that require a permit. They also have lots of useful information about these areas that you should read before you fly. Can I Fly my Drone in Reykjavík and Other Towns? According to the regulations, flying in the city of Reyjkjavík and other towns is not permitted unless you have special permission. The reason for this is because flying to close to airports, as well as public and private property is not permitted under Icelandic law.\n\nI can imagine a high-art\/commercial-art rumble brewing over this (what is art, really?) The motivation for the FAA policy was to continue to allow toy-like aircraft to fly under the radar (sorry), while strictly regulating private use of larger, faster, and more technologically advanced unmanned aircraft. The current regulation, strangely, splits two identical drones flying in an identical way into either an “Aircraft,” or just “a model plane,” based purely on whether the flight is used for a commercial purpose. Given the poorly defined term, “commercial,” flying a drone that includes a camera may be illegal simply because the owner–privately, in his or her own mind–is contemplating selling the pictures. The result of this seemingly arbitrary FAA policies and conflicting case law is the stifling of legitimate and safe drone use for “business purposes,” such as filmmaking, journalism, and commercial photography. Congress is attempting to remedy the situation with the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, which requires the FAA to actually come up with some workable rules to regulate the use of drones. These rules are supposed to be in place by September 2015, but government bureaucracies aren’t known for their nimbleness. In the 2007 policy statement on drones, the FAA announced that it had “undertaken a safety review that will examine the feasibility of creating a different category of unmanned ‘vehicles’… focused on operations which do not qualify as sport and recreation, but also may not require a certificate of airworthiness.”\nThis certainly sounds like the FAA would consider an artistic exception to their drone rules but that policy statement was made seven years ago. So how this will play out still remains a question, given that the first handful of commercial drone flights were only approved in the last few months. Will the rules change as the technology becomes more accepted and safety concerns are addressed? Of course. How fast will the FAA drone rules change? No one knows. 157 Comments|Getty Images is one of the largest purveyor of stock photos in the world and aggressively protects their copyrights.

If so, we must seek an authorization through the FAA and other Controlling entities. Once an authorization is granted, their are usually more restrictive guidelines that have to be followed such as distance and altitude from the subject. How high can you fly? Part 107 requires that an SUAS operator cannot fly above 400 feet agl (above ground level). The exception to this rule is that as long as you are within 400 feet of a structure, you can fly up to 400 ft above that structure. Sounds confusing I know. Let’s say you are inspecting a cell tower that is 350 ft tall. As long as you are within 400 feet of the tower, you can fly at a max of 400 ft above that tower. In this situation, You could fly 750 ft agl. Am I required to have a UAS License to take drone pictures for real estate even if not getting paid? Yes. The FAA even addresses this specifically. Many folks are probably doing it now….. but at a big risk. The FAA can not only fine you for doing this, but even if you hire an unlicensed drone operator for a commercial purpose, then you as the agent can be held liable too.\n\nAt the end of the day, move the footage you’ve collected onto the tablet and use the external hard drive (or two) as your secondary backup. This protects the footage you have collected without worrying about access to WiFi or other services. Get a Remote Pilots Certificate from the FAA if you’ll be piloting your drone for commercial purposes, including monetized blogs and vlogs\nBy Paul from Travel is Life\nIf you’ll be posting your drone shots on a video channel or blog that is monetized (whether with ads, affiliate links, digital product sales, etc), you’re technically using your drone for commercial purposes, and you need a Remote Pilots Certificate from the FAA. The test costs $150 and takes a day of studying. I enjoyed the process because I learned information about air space regulations, weather patterns, and safety precautions that I would need to know anyway – even as a hobbyist. The fines are too big to risk not obtaining your certificate, and who knows… being commercially licensed might one day make the difference between you getting permission to fly your drone at a particular location and capture the shots you’re after. Places are getting more strict about drone operations every day, and it’s best to play by the rules when federal airspace is involved. Check to see if there is any sensitive or endangered wildlife in the area that you should avoid\nBy Cristina from Travel For Wildlife\nWhen planning your flight take some time to research the area’s wildlife. Your flight shouldn’t approach resting, nesting, or feeding animals as drones can negatively affect wildlife. For example it can flush nesting birds, can cause resting seals to flee toward the water trampling others during their escape, and can dangerously raise the heart rate and stress level of bears. These are just some of the reasons that drones have been banned from National Parks and National Wildlife Refuges in the US. The ban carries a maximum penalty of a $5,000 fine and six months in jail. Other countries have different rules, and it is always important to check the rules for each country. In South Africa, a visitor was banned for life after other visitors reported him for flying a drone in Kruger National Park. If you visit a national park in South Africa and carry a drone, make sure to disclose it when you enter the park, as park officials will seal it until you leave. This might save you a hefty fee or ban for having an unsealed drone found in your car! Be careful not to disturb any wildlife\nBy Christa Rolls from Expedition Wildlife\nBe cautious and conscientious about flying your drone near wildlife. Drones can be seen as a threat to wildlife, and animals will expend unnecessary resources to either defend their territory or flee somewhere they’ll feel protected from your drone. The best consideration is to pinpoint the wildlife present near your flight zone prior to take off, and as soon as their behavior changes in association with the drone’s presence, discontinue flying. Consider having a spotter, meaning one person watches the wildlife’s demeanor for any behavioral changes or stress, while the other operates the drone. This is not only for the wildlife’s safety, and the ethics consideration of flying drones near wildlife, but also for you and your drone’s well-being. A bird dive-bombing your drone can easily take it down, and likely injure the bird in the process, as well as leave you liable for wildlife harassment charges. Make best use of your incredible footage\nBy Bradley from Dream Big, Travel Far\nWith so much effort spent capturing your drone footage, my top tip would be to ensure you have a plan in place to make best use of it. Simply put you have 2 choices. Either you learn how to edit video footage yourself or you hire someone who knows how to. Making breathtaking travel videos are the ultimate reminder of your time abroad. So failing to make use of it is almost a sin! Personally, we are in the process of following both of these options. We have a friend who is great at video editing, and is currently working through our footage in Sri Lanka to make some tantalizing travel videos. At the same time, we have downloaded Adobe Premiere Elements and are busy learning and practicing our skills. Hopefully these tips have prepared you for your first trip with your drone. Feel free to add any other tips for traveling with a drone in the comments below.\n\nThe Location Manager’s Guide to Drones\nThe following was featured in our e-newsletter, the M2 Aerials Report. To be included in future newsletters, subscribe at the bottom of this page. With drones now commonplace in the industry, Location Managers have the difficult task of knowing where drones can be flown and how to get in front of the issues that can arise when using drones for filming. With turnaround times as short as two weeks, it’s important to look for red flags upfront that may cause problems when it comes time to shoot. The first thing to know is that no matter their job function at the time, drones are an aviation tool and are regulated accordingly by the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration). The FAA has several standard regulations to be aware of. Here’s an overview:\nIt is important to note that these laws are important for the safety and structure of national airspace, but waivers for these rules can be requested by licensed drone operators on a case by case basis. When you see a red flag, contact your drone operator as soon as possible for guidance. Red Flags for Drone Filming:\nAirport within a 5-mile radius\nFilming at a prison\nMilitary base in the area\nSchool in the area\nIn many circumstances, proper permissions can be achieved, but the last thing you want to do is to choose a location only to find out that you won’t be able to fly the drone afterward. “The last thing you want to happen is the Director chooses the one prison you scouted, for instance, that doesn’t allow drones. Then you’re stuck,” says Beth Melnick, Location Scout Manager for Northlight Locations. She advises scouts to pick up the phone at the first sign of an issue:\n“As soon as you see a red flag, call your drone operator.”\nIn addition to federal regulations (more details here), states, cities, and local municipalities often have their own regulations that go above and beyond the FAA’s requirements. When scouting a location, keep the following in mind:\nTiming of the Shoot\nWith limited time to prep for a shoot, ask yourself important questions early. - Looking to catch the magic hour? You will need a Nighttime Waiver. - Want to shoot downtown? Plan carefully; flying over people requires a special waiver. - Is your perfect location outside next to an airport or government building? You’ll need a waiver to fly in a restricted airspace. - Tip: Use https:\/\/app.airmap.io\/ to check airspace for your location\nSome waivers can take up to 4 months to process! If your drone shot is at the beginning of filming and you’re going to need a waiver, it may not come in time. Applying for waivers can be a taxing process and are never guaranteed. We suggest consulting with an experienced drone cinematographer as early as possible whenever aerial shots are desired. Some FAA-certified aerial filming companies, like M2 Aerials, have already obtained waivers that stay with them, such as a nighttime flying waiver. This means they don’t need to apply for a waiver for your job; the waiver is good for any otherwise-approved job in the U.S. Drone operators can also request near real-time processing of airspace authorization for locations that are part of the FAA’s LAANC system (Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability). Confirm these permissions with your drone pilot. The Location of the Set\nYou can quickly assess the ease or difficulty with which you will be able to use a drone for filming by the type of scene location. Urban settings require the most consideration and preparation. The most inhibiting federal regulation for using a drone in urban environment is the restriction on flying over people who are not part of the operation. Due to the highly populated nature of cities, this makes filming especially difficult. For veterans of the industry, it is good practice to think of flying a drone in the same way you think of flying a helicopter. Make the same provisions such as clearing the streets. If a helicopter could shoot the scene legally, so can the drone. The other inhibitor to urban filming via drone is privacy laws. If you’re going to be flying over skyscrapers or commercial buildings, you must first obtain permission from the building owner. Most major cities have their own regulations and codes for UAV operations, some stricter than others.\n\nWashingon D.C. is a strict No Fly Zone. If using a drone for filming anywhere in or near Los Angeles, you have to obtain a permit first from the L.A. Film Commission. To use a drone on state property, apply with the California Film Commission here. New York City’s air map is complex; if shooting in NYC, contact your drone operator to be sure you will not be hit with fines. “A lot of people want to fly on 42nd street, but that kind of shoot is so limited,” says Jeff Caron, NYC-based DGA Location Manager & Part 107 Certified Drone Operator. “It has less to do with airspace and more to do with flying over people.”\nHe goes on to recommend,\n“If your ideal location has multiple red flags, call your drone pilot right away and talk through it. Oftentimes, creative strategies can be formulated to accomplish the vision.”\nSee more location-specific details on our Location Manager’s Drone Cheat Sheet. Generally speaking, the further away you are from a metropolitan area, the easier the process will be. However, you still must be conscious of privacy laws and restricted airspace. If you’re using someone’s private property for filming, be sure to inform them and their neighbors of the use of a drone when you acquire permissions. There has been more than one instance of drones being shot from the sky from property owners wary of its purpose above their home. Also, you’ll want to confirm that there are not any small or private airports, or other sensitive areas (military bases, prisons, etc) within a 5-mile radius before booking the site, as drone use may be prohibited. Although the complexity of federal and local drone laws can feel overwhelming, creativity and an experienced drone pilot are your most useful tools in getting the shot you want. Talk to our team of drone operators to see what can be done to achieve your vision.\n\nIn the past, provided you weren’t within a few miles of a major airport or military base you could rely on few problems. But recently, no-fly zones have begun to sprout up all over the landscape. More and more urban areas and national parks have begun to enforce these zones (enforced via locational ‘geo-fencing’ software I might add, rather than the more exciting prospects of miniaturized air-aircraft batteries or dogfights with specially trained albatrosses), so it’s important to check before setting out to avoid disappointment. Just because you’ve flown there before doesn’t mean things will still be the same, for example, the city where we are now based has changed its no fly zones at least 3 times in the past year, going from a free for all, to a complete ban, to now restricted flying zones just around the city centre and the university campus. You can usually find updated maps online, or through your drone software. So check carefully, and as close as possible to the time of your visit. Plan your drone locations and shots beforehand\nBy Charmaine from LuvMiHome.com\nMake a list of the drone locations you are interested in beforehand. You can use tools such as Google earth to scout your locations and find interesting angles. This will give you an idea of what your location looks like from the air as well as the ground. You will also need to consider what altitude works best for your location. Don’t be afraid to try different altitudes and angles of your target to get the best possible shot. Lighting is an important factor; you will need to figure out the direction of the light during different times of the day and select the appropriate time. Lastly make sure you fly your drone in good weather; snow, rain and wind can be a menace to your drone. Be wary or avoid flying over crowds\nBy Lexi from A Scenic Find\nI’ve seen a few drop out of the sky (mine included), so I’m always super careful about where I fly them. The best places to fly them are in open fields, beaches or anywhere where crowds are sparse. It’s so easy to think of them as toys, but they can and do malfunction mid flight occasionally. I’ve had one of mine drop out of the sky into a lake due to a technical error, since then I’ve always been super strict about where I fly if there are crowds around. Flying with LiPo batteries and keeping them safe\nBy Manon from Visiting the Dutch Countryside\nIf you’re traveling with your drone you, most likely, need to pack LiPo batteries. You can only take LiPo batteries with you in your hand luggage and airlines won’t allow you to check them. LiPo batteries can combust, so you have to do everything you can prevent this. Cover the battery terminals with gaffer’s tape and place the batteries inside a fireproof, special LiPo battery, bag. Don’t forget to drain the batteries before you’re headed to the airport. You need to check with your airlines how many LiPo batteries you are allowed to take. Keeping drone batteries warm in the winter\nBy Manon from Visiting the Dutch Countryside\nWhen you want to use your drone in cold temperatures, or when you’re traveling through cold temperatures, you need to keep the batteries warm. One way of keeping the batteries warm is keeping them in a warm pocket. The batteries drain quick in cold temperatures. So if you can place them close to your body that would be perfect. You can also put the batteries in a sock, which is a better option if you have the batteries in a case. The absolute best place to warm them is close to your body. For instance, wear a sweater with pockets and put a few batteries inside the pockets. Drone footage storage while traveling\nBy Christa from Expedition Wildlife\nMake sure you have a plan to back up your video footage during your travels. There are multiple ways you can ensure the drone videos you’ve taken don’t get lost or damaged – this can include transferring everything onto an external hard drive or onto a cloud account. Also consider keeping multiple memory cards handy to switch out in the event that you need more storage space or don’t want to have all of your hard work on one card alone. We recommend purchasing a tablet, or other lightweight and easily packable device, and an external hard drive to use as a storage space and transfer mechanism for your footage.","passages":[{"passage":"Lastly, if your drone has an electronic camera and also can taking pictures or videos, after that you need to have consent from the appropriate authorities to take a picture or a video, or else it is unlawful to do so.

A photo flight is a flight in a helicopter or airplane with a photographer on board, taking pictures of properties, events, construction sites or other projects. So why not just use a drone? That seems to be just so much easier, right? Well, a drone is very lightweight, and can stay in the air only for a limited amount of time. Winds can be challenging for a drone because of its weight. There are also restrictions on what you can do with a drone. You cannot operate above a certain altitude without FAA approval, and you cannot operate close to certain airports. A helicopter or airplane is able to stay in the air for hours, if needed. An aircraft can cover a way bigger area and give the photographer better flexibility. There are specific applications where a drone makes way more sense than a helicopter or airplane. Especially if you are operating close to the ground. So both have their advantages and disadvantages. How does a photo flight typically work? We typically start with a ground briefing with the photographer and the pilot. This is to make sure both know exactly what is expected and what is of importance to the photographer or camera man and the project. This is of even more importance if a video or movie is shot. It will help keep the cost down, since we want to keep the time that we are in the helicopter actually flying as focused and short as possible. Also important is the safety briefing. No loose objects in the aircraft. We try to fulfill the needs of the photographer but it is of the highest importance that the flight is safe. What projects have we done in the past? We have worked on film and photo projects including Music Videos, Vehicle promotion videos and lots of photography projects. Some of those include Vineyards, buildings, marathons, crop fields, construction sites and more. If you have any questions or need details on how we can help you with a certain project, please don’t hesitate to contact us.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:1b07a219-3f2e-423f-b97a-29f0b385e4b4>"]},{"passage":"Post new question\nDoes anyone use a drone here whenever you travel inside india? is it really necessary to take permission before flying a drone in rural or tourist places inside india?

Even before the eruption, Iceland was a feast for drone pilots who would come from all over the world looking for stunning content for their Instagram feed, and they would not leave disappointed. You might be planning to do the same? Honestly, who could blame you? So, you are probably wondering what the rules are regarding safety and where you can fly freely? Well, look no further, here is a useful guide regarding flying a drone in Iceland. Which Areas are Safe for Flying a Drone in Iceland? The great news is that, when it comes to flying a drone in Iceland, you may do so freely in most parts of the country. However, as with everywhere, there are certain rules are regulations concerning safe and legal drone use. So, it is best to be prepared. Here are the main rules to follow\nIf you plan to fly for commercial purposes, then you need to register your drone. If its just for fun, then no need to worry! Your drone must weigh no more than 3kg in urban areas, and no more then 25kg in rural areas. You are permitted to fly your drone no more than 120 meters from the ground.You cannot fly any closed than 2km to the international airport, and no more than 1.5km to any other airport in the country. Please ensure that you fly no closer than 150 meters to public and private buildings in rural areas with express permission from the property owner. Also, please ensure you do not fly any closer than 150 meters to public buildings and 50 km to private buildings in urban areas without permission from the property owner. Never fly over crowds of people\nNever disturb wildlife with your drone. Animals such as birds, horses, seals, reindeer, etc are to be left to behave naturally. Drones can be frightening to them, and can cause panicked and unnatural behaviour. Drone flights in all national parks, protected areas, nature reserves and monuments are not permitted. These areas include Vatnajökull National Park, Þingvellir National Park, Snæfellsjökull National Park, Dyrhólaey, Látrabjarg, Hornstrandir, Geysir, Gullfoss, etc.For commercial drone photography, you can apply for an exemption permit to some of the restrictions mentioned above. Flying a Drone in Iceland’s National Parks\nThe national parks of Iceland are off limits for drone use, except on special circumstances. The same is also true for many protected areas of interest around the country. The reason for this is to protect fragile and sensitive nature, animal life and for the safety and enjoyment of other people. For example, places such as Skógafoss waterfall, Dyrhólaey nature reserve and Látrabjarg have a protected status because of nesting birds. The use of drones can disturb the birds and can lead to eggs or chicks being abandoned. This can then lead to a reduction in numbers. There are also many seal colonies around Iceland, and areas that seals simply like to visit, such as Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon. Drones can drive them away from these areas, and they may never return if they do not feel safe. Skógafoss is a very tempting place to film with your drone, and if you film from the left of the waterfall then this is perfectly fine, but once you encroach on the monument area then drones are not permitted. Can I Get Special Permission for Flying a Drone in Iceland’s National Parks? Yes, you can. Provided your footage is to be used for commercial purposes. You can apply for a special permit, where you can discuss your plans. Upon granting of a permit, you will receive expert guidance on where you can fly, at what time of day, etc. You can apply to for a permit in Vatnajökull National Park, Þingvellir National Park and you can also apply to the Environment Agency of Iceland for permission to fly in Snæfellsjökull National Park and all other protected areas that require a permit. They also have lots of useful information about these areas that you should read before you fly. Can I Fly my Drone in Reykjavík and Other Towns? According to the regulations, flying in the city of Reyjkjavík and other towns is not permitted unless you have special permission. The reason for this is because flying to close to airports, as well as public and private property is not permitted under Icelandic law.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:b6a729be-5161-476d-b9a5-cfe13005cd2f>"]},{"passage":"I can imagine a high-art\/commercial-art rumble brewing over this (what is art, really?) The motivation for the FAA policy was to continue to allow toy-like aircraft to fly under the radar (sorry), while strictly regulating private use of larger, faster, and more technologically advanced unmanned aircraft. The current regulation, strangely, splits two identical drones flying in an identical way into either an “Aircraft,” or just “a model plane,” based purely on whether the flight is used for a commercial purpose. Given the poorly defined term, “commercial,” flying a drone that includes a camera may be illegal simply because the owner–privately, in his or her own mind–is contemplating selling the pictures. The result of this seemingly arbitrary FAA policies and conflicting case law is the stifling of legitimate and safe drone use for “business purposes,” such as filmmaking, journalism, and commercial photography. Congress is attempting to remedy the situation with the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, which requires the FAA to actually come up with some workable rules to regulate the use of drones. These rules are supposed to be in place by September 2015, but government bureaucracies aren’t known for their nimbleness. In the 2007 policy statement on drones, the FAA announced that it had “undertaken a safety review that will examine the feasibility of creating a different category of unmanned ‘vehicles’… focused on operations which do not qualify as sport and recreation, but also may not require a certificate of airworthiness.”\nThis certainly sounds like the FAA would consider an artistic exception to their drone rules but that policy statement was made seven years ago. So how this will play out still remains a question, given that the first handful of commercial drone flights were only approved in the last few months. Will the rules change as the technology becomes more accepted and safety concerns are addressed? Of course. How fast will the FAA drone rules change?

Part 107 requires that an SUAS operator cannot fly above 400 feet agl (above ground level). The exception to this rule is that as long as you are within 400 feet of a structure, you can fly up to 400 ft above that structure. Sounds confusing I know. Let’s say you are inspecting a cell tower that is 350 ft tall. As long as you are within 400 feet of the tower, you can fly at a max of 400 ft above that tower. In this situation, You could fly 750 ft agl. Am I required to have a UAS License to take drone pictures for real estate even if not getting paid? Yes. The FAA even addresses this specifically.

Get a Remote Pilots Certificate from the FAA if you’ll be piloting your drone for commercial purposes, including monetized blogs and vlogs\nBy Paul from Travel is Life\nIf you’ll be posting your drone shots on a video channel or blog that is monetized (whether with ads, affiliate links, digital product sales, etc), you’re technically using your drone for commercial purposes, and you need a Remote Pilots Certificate from the FAA. The test costs $150 and takes a day of studying. I enjoyed the process because I learned information about air space regulations, weather patterns, and safety precautions that I would need to know anyway – even as a hobbyist. The fines are too big to risk not obtaining your certificate, and who knows… being commercially licensed might one day make the difference between you getting permission to fly your drone at a particular location and capture the shots you’re after. Places are getting more strict about drone operations every day, and it’s best to play by the rules when federal airspace is involved. Check to see if there is any sensitive or endangered wildlife in the area that you should avoid\nBy Cristina from Travel For Wildlife\nWhen planning your flight take some time to research the area’s wildlife. Your flight shouldn’t approach resting, nesting, or feeding animals as drones can negatively affect wildlife. For example it can flush nesting birds, can cause resting seals to flee toward the water trampling others during their escape, and can dangerously raise the heart rate and stress level of bears. These are just some of the reasons that drones have been banned from National Parks and National Wildlife Refuges in the US. The ban carries a maximum penalty of a $5,000 fine and six months in jail. Other countries have different rules, and it is always important to check the rules for each country. In South Africa, a visitor was banned for life after other visitors reported him for flying a drone in Kruger National Park. If you visit a national park in South Africa and carry a drone, make sure to disclose it when you enter the park, as park officials will seal it until you leave. This might save you a hefty fee or ban for having an unsealed drone found in your car! Be careful not to disturb any wildlife\nBy Christa Rolls from Expedition Wildlife\nBe cautious and conscientious about flying your drone near wildlife. Drones can be seen as a threat to wildlife, and animals will expend unnecessary resources to either defend their territory or flee somewhere they’ll feel protected from your drone. The best consideration is to pinpoint the wildlife present near your flight zone prior to take off, and as soon as their behavior changes in association with the drone’s presence, discontinue flying. Consider having a spotter, meaning one person watches the wildlife’s demeanor for any behavioral changes or stress, while the other operates the drone. This is not only for the wildlife’s safety, and the ethics consideration of flying drones near wildlife, but also for you and your drone’s well-being. A bird dive-bombing your drone can easily take it down, and likely injure the bird in the process, as well as leave you liable for wildlife harassment charges. Make best use of your incredible footage\nBy Bradley from Dream Big, Travel Far\nWith so much effort spent capturing your drone footage, my top tip would be to ensure you have a plan in place to make best use of it.

To be included in future newsletters, subscribe at the bottom of this page. With drones now commonplace in the industry, Location Managers have the difficult task of knowing where drones can be flown and how to get in front of the issues that can arise when using drones for filming. With turnaround times as short as two weeks, it’s important to look for red flags upfront that may cause problems when it comes time to shoot. The first thing to know is that no matter their job function at the time, drones are an aviation tool and are regulated accordingly by the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration). The FAA has several standard regulations to be aware of. Here’s an overview:\nIt is important to note that these laws are important for the safety and structure of national airspace, but waivers for these rules can be requested by licensed drone operators on a case by case basis. When you see a red flag, contact your drone operator as soon as possible for guidance. Red Flags for Drone Filming:\nAirport within a 5-mile radius\nFilming at a prison\nMilitary base in the area\nSchool in the area\nIn many circumstances, proper permissions can be achieved, but the last thing you want to do is to choose a location only to find out that you won’t be able to fly the drone afterward. “The last thing you want to happen is the Director chooses the one prison you scouted, for instance, that doesn’t allow drones. Then you’re stuck,” says Beth Melnick, Location Scout Manager for Northlight Locations. She advises scouts to pick up the phone at the first sign of an issue:\n“As soon as you see a red flag, call your drone operator.”\nIn addition to federal regulations (more details here), states, cities, and local municipalities often have their own regulations that go above and beyond the FAA’s requirements. When scouting a location, keep the following in mind:\nTiming of the Shoot\nWith limited time to prep for a shoot, ask yourself important questions early. - Looking to catch the magic hour? You will need a Nighttime Waiver. - Want to shoot downtown? Plan carefully; flying over people requires a special waiver. - Is your perfect location outside next to an airport or government building? You’ll need a waiver to fly in a restricted airspace. - Tip: Use https:\/\/app.airmap.io\/ to check airspace for your location\nSome waivers can take up to 4 months to process! If your drone shot is at the beginning of filming and you’re going to need a waiver, it may not come in time. Applying for waivers can be a taxing process and are never guaranteed. We suggest consulting with an experienced drone cinematographer as early as possible whenever aerial shots are desired. Some FAA-certified aerial filming companies, like M2 Aerials, have already obtained waivers that stay with them, such as a nighttime flying waiver. This means they don’t need to apply for a waiver for your job; the waiver is good for any otherwise-approved job in the U.S. Drone operators can also request near real-time processing of airspace authorization for locations that are part of the FAA’s LAANC system (Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability). Confirm these permissions with your drone pilot. The Location of the Set\nYou can quickly assess the ease or difficulty with which you will be able to use a drone for filming by the type of scene location. Urban settings require the most consideration and preparation. The most inhibiting federal regulation for using a drone in urban environment is the restriction on flying over people who are not part of the operation. Due to the highly populated nature of cities, this makes filming especially difficult. For veterans of the industry, it is good practice to think of flying a drone in the same way you think of flying a helicopter. Make the same provisions such as clearing the streets. If a helicopter could shoot the scene legally, so can the drone. The other inhibitor to urban filming via drone is privacy laws. If you’re going to be flying over skyscrapers or commercial buildings, you must first obtain permission from the building owner. Most major cities have their own regulations and codes for UAV operations, some stricter than others.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:39c8e512-7526-48c0-a055-5fd16257378c>"]},{"passage":"Washingon D.C. is a strict No Fly Zone. If using a drone for filming anywhere in or near Los Angeles, you have to obtain a permit first from the L.A. Film Commission. To use a drone on state property, apply with the California Film Commission here. New York City’s air map is complex; if shooting in NYC, contact your drone operator to be sure you will not be hit with fines. “A lot of people want to fly on 42nd street, but that kind of shoot is so limited,” says Jeff Caron, NYC-based DGA Location Manager & Part 107 Certified Drone Operator. “It has less to do with airspace and more to do with flying over people.”\nHe goes on to recommend,\n“If your ideal location has multiple red flags, call your drone pilot right away and talk through it. Oftentimes, creative strategies can be formulated to accomplish the vision.”\nSee more location-specific details on our Location Manager’s Drone Cheat Sheet. Generally speaking, the further away you are from a metropolitan area, the easier the process will be. However, you still must be conscious of privacy laws and restricted airspace. If you’re using someone’s private property for filming, be sure to inform them and their neighbors of the use of a drone when you acquire permissions. There has been more than one instance of drones being shot from the sky from property owners wary of its purpose above their home. Also, you’ll want to confirm that there are not any small or private airports, or other sensitive areas (military bases, prisons, etc) within a 5-mile radius before booking the site, as drone use may be prohibited. Although the complexity of federal and local drone laws can feel overwhelming, creativity and an experienced drone pilot are your most useful tools in getting the shot you want.

For businesses dealing with uncertain demand and lead times, there are specific models available. The newsvendor problem approach is particularly useful when dealing with perishable items or services with time-sensitive demand.","answer":"Managing inventory for a service business can be quite different from managing inventory for a product-based business, as the focus is more on managing resources and capacity rather than physical stock. Here are some strategies for effectively managing inventory in a service business:\n\n1. **Understand Your Resources**: Identify all the resources needed to deliver your services, such as equipment, facilities, materials, and human capital. For example, in a restaurant, this would include kitchen equipment, food supplies, and staff.\n\n2. **Demand Forecasting**: Predict the demand for your services based on historical data, market trends, and seasonal variations. This will help you plan your resources accordingly.\n\n3. **Capacity Planning**: Ensure you have enough capacity to meet the forecasted demand. This includes having enough staff on hand, ensuring facilities are available, and managing equipment maintenance schedules.\n\n4. **Inventory Management Systems**: Use inventory management software to track your resources, monitor usage, and identify when it's time to replenish supplies. For service businesses, this could mean tracking perishable food items, cleaning supplies, or repair parts.\n\n5. **Supplier Relationships**: Build strong relationships with suppliers to ensure a steady supply of materials and services. This can help you negotiate better prices and terms, which can be crucial for maintaining profitability.\n\n6. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular audits of your resources to ensure accuracy in your inventory records. This can help you identify discrepancies and prevent over-ordering or under-ordering.\n\n7. **Optimize Inventory Levels**: Try to maintain optimal inventory levels to avoid both stockouts and overstock situations. For example, in a hotel, this might mean keeping just enough linens and toiletries to meet guest needs without having excess.\n\n8. **Implement Just-In-Time (JIT) Practices**: Where possible, adopt JIT practices to minimize inventory holding costs and reduce waste. For instance, a catering service might receive food supplies just before an event rather than storing them for long periods.\n\n9. **Employee Training**: Train your staff on inventory management best practices to ensure they understand the importance of efficient resource use and are equipped to manage inventory effectively.\n\n10. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly review your inventory management processes and look for ways to improve efficiency. This could involve adopting new technologies, streamlining workflows, or implementing better forecasting methods.\n\n11. **Technology Utilization**: Leverage technology such as barcode systems, RFID, or inventory management software to keep track of resources and automate inventory tracking processes.\n\n12. **Emergency Preparedness**: Have a plan in place for unexpected events that could disrupt your inventory, such as natural disasters, equipment failure, or sudden spikes in demand.\n\nBy focusing on these strategies, service businesses can effectively manage their inventory, ensuring they have the resources needed to deliver high-quality services while minimizing costs and maximizing efficiency.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context:\nAre you looking for an effective way to manage and track inventory in your business? Inventory management and tracking services can help you stay on top of your stock levels, ensuring that you have the right amount of products on hand at all times. From tracking inventory levels to forecasting demand, these services can save you time and money while providing you with the peace of mind that your inventory is in good shape. With so many inventory management and tracking services on the market, it can be difficult to choose the right one for your needs. This article will provide an overview of the different types of services available and discuss the benefits they can offer. What is Inventory Management and Tracking?Inventory management and tracking is a process of managing and tracking inventory items, such as raw materials, parts, and finished products. It is typically done using a software system that tracks the quantity, location, and status of the items in the inventory. This system also helps with the ordering, storage, and delivery of items. The goal of inventory management and tracking is to ensure that a business has enough inventory to meet customer demand while minimizing costs. Benefits of Inventory Management and Tracking ServicesInventory management and tracking services provide businesses with a number of benefits, including improved accuracy and efficiency in managing inventory, better customer service, reduced costs, and improved product availability. By using an inventory management system, businesses can track the flow of goods through their warehouses or stores, allowing them to better manage their stock levels. This helps to reduce costs by preventing over-ordering or under-ordering of goods. Additionally, it allows businesses to quickly identify and respond to customer orders or stock shortages. Common Solutions for Inventory Management and Tracking ServicesThere are several common solutions for inventory management and tracking services. These include barcoding systems, RFID technology, and software-based inventory systems. Barcoding systems are used to track inventory items by scanning barcodes on the items. RFID technology uses radio frequencies to track the location and status of items. Software-based systems provide an automated way to manage inventory by tracking item information, such as quantity, location, and status. Best Practices for Implementing Inventory Management and Tracking ServicesWhen implementing an inventory management system, there are several best practices that should be followed. First, businesses should define the scope of their inventory management system by determining what needs to be tracked. This includes identifying the types of items that need to be tracked, as well as any other information that needs to be recorded such as expiration dates and minimum quantities. Additionally, businesses should choose a system that meets their needs in terms of scalability, ease of use, cost effectiveness, and integration with other systems. Challenges in Inventory Management and Tracking ServicesOne of the main challenges with inventory management and tracking services is maintaining accurate data. If data is inaccurate or incomplete, it can lead to incorrect decisions being made about stock levels or customer orders. To prevent this from happening, businesses should ensure they have processes in place for verifying data accuracy on a regular basis. Additionally, businesses should regularly review their inventory processes to ensure they are efficient and effective. ConclusionInventory management and tracking services are essential for businesses looking to optimize their operations and ensure efficient storage and stock control. By implementing an inventory management system, businesses can benefit from improved accuracy in managing their inventory, better customer service, reduced costs, and improved product availability. Additionally, businesses should follow best practices when implementing an inventory management system such as defining the scope of the system, choosing the right system for their needs, and maintaining accurate data. In conclusion, inventory management and tracking services are essential for businesses looking to optimize their operations and ensure efficient storage and stock control. By understanding the benefits they can provide, companies can successfully implement best practices and leverage common solutions to maximize their operational efficiency and success.\n\nInventory management is an essential part of doing business, whether you’re a Fortune 500 company or a mom-and-pop shop. It will come as no surprise, however, that the majority of small and medium-sized businesses don’t operate best practices when it comes to their inventory. To say that current practices are on the sloppy side would be polite. Many businesses fall into the trap of overstocking items, just in case there is a sudden glut of demand on the market. The problem with this is that it worsens the condition of the balance sheet while at the same time, forcing you to increase the space that you dedicate to storing stock. Overall, it pushes up your costs and makes your firm less competitive. In this article, we’re going to investigate how you can get inventive with inventory. So, let’s take a look. Get A Third Party To Track Stock\nIf you run a small business, then the chances are that you don’t have the time or resources to develop your own stock tracking system, allowing you to see what you’ve got in stock and what’s on order at any given moment. The good news, however, is that you don’t need to do any of this yourself: it can all be overseen by a third party. Take dental practices, for instance. Many track dental purchases using a third-party system rather than attempting to do it themselves. Not only does this help bring down costs, but it also improves the patient experience. Customers no longer have to worry about not getting the items that they need. It’s all automated, reducing the chance of error. Be Consistent With How You Manage Incoming Inventory\nLarge businesses make sure that the way that they manage incoming inventory is the same every time to avoid things like shrinkage and double counting. But small companies don’t operate at the same level of rigor. Often each individual in the firm has their own way of receiving new inventory, creating tracking issues. It’s a good idea, therefore, to develop a standard system with your staff so that each person in your organization knows how they should receive stock in the future. Doing this will help you verify that you’ve received the right items, saving you money in the long-term. Update Inventory Totals Daily\nIt might seem basic, but many small businesses don’t update their inventories at the end of the working day. This is a problem. If you don’t track sales, then you won’t know what’s sold and what needs to be ordered in larger quantities. Tracking sales allows you to see seasonal variations in demand, as well as day-to-day demand fluctuations which could help you better manage stock overall. Conduct An Inventory Audit\nDo you know what’s in your inventory? Or have you just been guessing for the last few months since you last took stock? Many successful businesses audit their inventory on a daily or weekly basis. Not only does this allow you to match up the real levels of your stock to what you think you have, but it also shows you which products are your most popular.\n\n5 Inventory Planning Best Practices\nIn a session we co-presented at the recent National Conference on Operations & Fulfillment in Las Vegas, we led a panel that delivered the following top five inventory planning best practices:\n- Build partnerships with suppliers. View your suppliers as subordinates and they’ll simply do your bidding. Work with them as partners and you’ll succeed together. You'll achieve more sales — with higher fulfillment, fewer overstocks and better inventory turnover — if you have a partner relationship with suppliers. Communicate with suppliers comprehensively and often. If they can anticipate your needs, they have a better chance of having raw materials and manufacturing capacity available when you need it. Establish these relationships so suppliers can tell you any bad news before delays in production or delivery impact your business. - Capture shadow or lost demand. Incomplete or inaccurate demand data leads to faulty demand planning and inaccurate purchasing decisions. What's more, it negatively impacts staff efficiency. Without accurate demand data, merchants can make incorrect decisions about strong vs. weak sellers. In addition, not capturing lost demand understates response rates and average order size, potentially impacting future list selection. - Measure both order and item fulfillment. Order fulfillment is the best measure of customer satisfaction. It gauges the percentage of customers that are shipped their orders complete at the time of order. The best measure of inventory buying performance is item fulfillment. This measures the percentage of individual items that are shipped to customers when ordered. Understand the relationship between the two so individual inventory buyers can comprehend their impact on total customer experience. - Forecast Internet demand. With Web sales growing to more than 50 percent of total sales for many catalogers, there's growing concern about how best to forecast. First, understand the true source of the demand. On average, only 10 percent to 20 percent of Internet demand is truly “incremental” and not driven by other media. There are two main approaches to online forecasting: time-phased modeling and traditional offer-based forecasting with demand curves. Both are valid. Ensure that you understand the marketing dynamics of your business to apply the appropriate mix of the two forecasting models. For details, see Ray Goodman’s March 2009 Catalog Success article, “Grab the Bull by Both Horns.”\n- Build processes for speed. Every day yields new information to consider. Success is directly related to the speed of receiving, processing and acting on new information. Whether it’s reforecasting demand, placing new purchase orders or adjusting existing ones, build systems and processes that maximize speed.

You must have a pretty overwhelming to-do list on your hands right about now, and managing your inventory is probably close to the top. Because most start-ups don’t have the cash to splash on an inventory-managing robot, we thought we’d share some advice on how to manage and organise your own inventory. Invest in Organisational Shelves and Products\nYes, cardboard boxes are great. And bags are handy too. But when it comes to your inventory, you need to take it up a notch to keep things organised and easy to find. If your small business or online store is blossoming from your spare room or garage, consider installing shelves and drawers for your stock. Then grab yourself a labeller to mark out certain spaces for certain products. Things will have their own designated place and you’ll be able to grab what you need without rustling through boxes and bags on the ground. Implement a Logical Layout\nSo the pink dog raincoats are flying out the door. But the green ones? Not so much. Take your product demand and turnover into account when organising a layout for your inventory. Put simply, you should keep stuff you always need (or frequently sell) at the front of your shelves or the top of your drawers, and stuff you don’t often need at the back or bottom. This will make your daily operations more efficient and make you 78%* less likely to split your pants while squatting down to grab stuff each day. *Totally fabricated statistic. National Storage cannot be held liable for any split pants. There really is an app for everything (there’s even one to train your bird to talk), and there’s no exception when it comes to getting your inventory on track. Try these helpful apps to keep your stock organised. $4.49 | Available on iPhone and iPad\nThis handy app is a lifesaver when it comes to tracking your inventory. When you buy new stock, you tell the app. As you receive, sell, ship and deliver items, you let the app know. This allows you to see everything in your inventory, their statuses, and your profits whenever you want. Inventory Now provides a simple stock overview that doesn’t leave you scratching your head and reaching for a calculator. $4.99 | Available on iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch\nSave money on dud stock by keeping an eye on sales trends with this app. On Shelf tells you what items are in stock and what items need reordering, and the barcode feature allows you to enter sales in a flash. If you want to know which items sell and which items you shouldn’t bother with, On Shelf is your guy. Or girl. At this point in time, we don’t know what gender – if any – On Shelf identifies as. Use A Self-Storage Unit\nWe’ve said it before and we’ll say it again – there really is nothing National Storage can’t do (except juggle; that is bloody tricky). Starting a business is also tricky, especially when it comes to finding a home for all your growing paperwork and inventory. If keeping boxes of files and stock in your garage isn’t really working for you, our business storage is the perfect solution. Some of our centres even offer a records management service for those of you who are feeling extra lazy. Just kidding! It really does take a lot of work off your hands, though. We’re considerate like that.\n\nSome businesses choose self-storage to store their inventory and supplies in — this is especially useful for space-starved cities like our own New York. It’s an economical and practical solution, which can alleviate some of the burden of the working or retail space. To help manage inventory and supplies in self-storage, we offer these tips:\nRecord your Inventory for easy access later\nTo avoid confusion later on and to keep track of your inventory and supplies, make a list of everything you plan to store. Group your items in a way that makes sense to your business. Make copies of your inventory—one to keep in the office and one to keep at the storage unit. Remember to update the inventory each time you retrieve items from, or add to, the unit. Decide on the Type of Storage you need\nYour inventory or supplies might need to be placed in a controlled temperature or humidity environment. If you are storing items such as antiques, art or rare books, you might want to consider climate-controlled storage. At Moishe’s Self Storage, we offer a wide variety of unit sizes and can even provide you with custom units to accommodate any size inventory. Our climate-controlled units are perfect for storing delicate art pieces or temperamental wines. And with the latest in security features – like motion detectors, closed-circuit monitors and fire suppression technology – you can be sure that your business inventory is in good hands. We offer convenient storage locations in Queens and the Bronx, so you’re never too far away from your belongings. Pack items properly\nPay attention to how you pack. Find boxes appropriate to each group of items while considering how often you will need to open each box and therefore sealing it in a way that accommodates your needs. For example, if you plan on opening a box each week to grab papers out of, you might opt for a file box and seal it in a way that’s easy to open. Pay Attention to the Order of Boxes\nPut the things you’ll need more frequently closer to the front of the unit and items you’ll use less frequently in the back. This will help you with retrieval and save you a game of musical boxes. Make a Map\nA map of the unit will help you know where each box is in the unit. Secure your schematic to a wall near the door for easy access.\n\nSound inventory management techniques are the foundation for strategic procurement, enabling you to:\nChoosing the right inventory management processes that suit your dental practice is not a simple task, and the more your business grows, the more difficult managing your inventory can be. That's why laying the right foundation with a scalable solution is critical for growth. Luckily, Method is here to help. Below we outline what inventory management entails, its benefits, and the techniques and best practices that make for good inventory management. We'll also dig into how digitization can enable efficiency and make life easier for employees, so they can get on with taking care of patients. Inventory management is the tracking and managing of inventory from the purchase of goods through to their sale or usage. Tracking inventory allows you to identify when it's time to order and how much to order, ensuring you always have enough stock of the right supplies to service your patients. Learning to manage your inventory is the first step in gaining control of your spending so you can stay within budget, minimize waste and leverage your purchasing volumes to reduce costs and improve profits. Although your supply inventory is needed to produce revenue, it also ties up cash. Too much inventory impedes your cash flow and puts you at risk of financial hits from expired, lost, or damaged stock. This is why inventory turnover (how long your inventory sits before it is used) is a good measurement of your inventory management. Inventory management is a key component of an organization's financial health, as it ensures you carry the appropriate amount of stock to suit your business needs. Carrying too much stock ties up cash and puts you at risk of loss, damaged or expired inventory. But too little inventory can lead to stockouts, damaging your patient care and revenue. Proper inventory management can also help save you money. By understanding your usage, you can leverage your purchasing volumes for cost savings and take advantage of economies of scale. Inventory management can save you on soft costs (indirect costs such as labor) and make life easier for your employees. By removing the guesswork from buying supplies, streamlining processes, and organizing supplies, employees can more easily reorder supplies and quickly find what they need when they need it. Your dental office is a busy place. But, by taking some moments to review and establish some essential inventory management processes, you can remove some of the chaos while improving profits. It's a win-win for employees and your balance sheet, providing you with a systematic, scalable approach to managing inventory that optimizes profits and supports future growth. For dental practices, the goal of inventory management is to know your stock levels, where that stock is located, and identify when it is time to order more and in what quantities. At its most basic level, the process works by tracking your current stock levels and then adjusting inventory down, as it is used, and up, upon receipt of deliveries. As no system is perfectly executed, inventory counts will lose accuracy over time. Therefore, physical inventory counts are performed to audit, validate and adjust inventory levels as needed to increase accuracy. The process begins when you identify the requirement for a specific supply. The item is then sourced, a vendor selected, and an order placed and tracked. Upon delivery and verification of the received item, quantity, and condition (the product must be in good order and fit for use), the quantity received is then adjusted into inventory. The inventory management process also involves organizing storage and analyzing future requirements by taking into consideration factors that may impact usages such as growth, scheduled services, or holidays to ensure inventory levels suffice and are used as efficiently as possible. Below we've listed nine good-to-know inventory management terms and techniques most relevant to the dental industry. These are the methods and processes that help you to balance your priorities, keeping your practice safe from disruption while taking into consideration the availability of resources and profits.The point is not to implement all these processes at once, but to choose what is most imperative for your practice and make small but ongoing improvements over time — because small changes lead to big impacts. Based on the famous Pareto principle, the ABC analysis is a way of identifying and categorizing inventory by popularity, with A being your highest movers and C being the least.\n\nA marketing communication plan is an essential tool for any firm. Generally speaking, if you want your firm to succeed, you must implement an integrated marketing communication plan.

Inventory planning enables businesses to purchase the appropriate amount of goods and determine how frequently to replenish. Inventory planning assists in lowering the cost of stocking things and ensuring that there is sufficient stock for manufacturing and selling items. Inventory management is a significant component of supply chain management. According to research, the 80\/20 rule implies that 80% of outcomes originate from 20% of efforts, customers, or another unit of measurement. When applied to inventories, the rule means that businesses generate approximately 80% of their revenues from 20% of their products. Benefits of Inventory Planning\nInventory control and planning are two processes part of inventory management. Planning and controlling are critical to management success, as with every management process. The rationale for such a strong emphasis on inventory is that it typically represents a corporation’s most significant cash-flow component. This is true for both purchasing and selling merchandise. As a result, inventory management directly impacts the organization’s financial health. Inventory control and planning benefit small firms in the following ways:\nInventory Management Strategies\nInventory management is a highly adaptable aspect of the company. Each business has a unique inventory control strategy. However, every organization should seek to eliminate human error as much as possible from inventory management, which includes utilizing inventory management software. Regardless of the method you employ, the following will help you manage your inventory more effectively—and increase your cash flow. 1. Six Sigma\nSix Sigma is a methodology and toolkit for enhancing business processes. It is used in inventory and supply chain management to minimize excess and obsolete write-offs. This inventory is frequently sold below cost or donated, which results in a loss of revenue for small business owners. Having the appropriate stock to meet demand minimizes waste and variation issues. Six Sigma is an excellent way of resolving inventory issues. It is orderly and dependable. 2. Set par levels\nSet par levels for each of your goods to simplify inventory management. Par levels are the bare minimum amount of product that must always be on hand. When your inventory falls below certain specified levels, it’s time to place more orders. Ideally, you’ll order the smallest quantity necessary to return above par. Par levels vary by product and determine the speed of an item sells and the time required to restock. While establishing par levels needs some study and decision-making upfront, they will streamline the ordering process. Not only will this make decision-making more accessible for you, but it will also empower your team to make decisions on your behalf. Bear in mind that circumstances change over time. Verify par levels many times a year to ensure they remain reasonable. Meanwhile, don’t be scared to tweak your par levels upward or below. First-in, first-out (FIFO) is a critical inventory management philosophy. This means that your oldest stock is sold first (first in), not your newest store. This is critical for perishable products to avoid unsellable spoiling. Additionally, FIFO is an intelligent technique for non-perishable products. If the same boxes are constantly relegated to the back, they are more prone to wear out. Also, packaging design and functionalities frequently evolve. You don’t want to ramble up with something any longer marketable. To handle a FIFO system effectively, you’ll need a well-organized warehouse. This often entails adding fresh items from the back or otherwise ensuring that existing inventory remains initially. If you’re operating with a warehousing and fulfillment provider, they’re likely already doing this, but it’s prudent to confirm. 4. Relationship management\nSuccessful inventory management requires the ability to adapt fast. Whether you need to return a slow-selling item to make place for a new product, swiftly replenish a high-volume seller, solve manufacturing concerns, or temporarily extend your storage space, it’s critical to maintain a solid relationship with your suppliers. In this manner, they’ll be more receptive to collaborating with you to resolve issues. Maintaining a positive relationship with your product suppliers, in particular, is critical. Frequently, minimum order amounts are negotiable.\n\nInventory shrink in the United States cost the retail industry about $46.8 billion. A business must have an efficient system of inventory management. The process involves tracking the stock and inventory life cycle once it gets to your business. If you aren’t aware of your inventory, decision making becomes problematic. Whether you are a brick-and-mortar or an online retailer, inventory management is imperative. With the different techniques available, you can’t miss a solution that will work for your business. What are the secrets small businesses can use to save money on inventory management? Learn how to manage inventories more effectively now. One principle of inventory management you ought to consider is the first-in, first-out approach. This inventory method ensures you sell your old stock first. It is especially vital when selling perishable products that might end up as spoilage. The first in, first out approach, commonly referred to as FIFO, also applies to non-perishables. Items can be worn out over time, that’s why storing them for long isn’t advisable. What’s more, the packaging designs keep changing. You need to restructure your warehouse in a way that encourages FIFO. Have a back door to ensure that the new products are at the backside. When the old products are at the front, the chances are that they will sell before the new entrants. 2. Use a Real-time and Centralized Database\nThe days of pen and paper in-store inventory control are over. Companies are adopting efficient options such as Excel to manage inventory. Nonetheless, the use of paper is still evident though minimal. With today’s dynamic business environment, inventory management should be within a centralized database. A supply chain has multiple users. A centralized system will allow all users to access the database in real-time. An inventory tracking system allows you to check products from the point the supplier delivers up until it reaches the customer. You need to note down the description and value of each item. Analyze the time the supplier takes to deliver. You can see the stock at this stage and plan. The timely interventions will save you money and waste. Besides, you’ll know if it’s necessary to make any adjustments at each point of the supply chain. Recent research projects that automation will reduce the need for office support by 20%. Industries are adopting automation because of increased efficiency. If you’ve been wondering how to manage inventories, automation can be an ideal option. Inputting data manually can be time-consuming and full of errors. The process is repetitive and can be quite daunting for your employees. Save your workers the overwhelming tasks and automate some processes. Automating most of your inventory management processes can increase scale-able. If you have to email and call your suppliers and workers each day to know the amount of inventory, it means that your business isn’t scale-able. Automated systems allow you to gather information faster. Automation decreases human error that’s imminent when making manual entries. Consequently, you might undersell or oversell your items. Automation allows you to edit or upgrade inventory at any time. With automated inventory processes, you don’t need to spend hours analyzing data at the expense of other business operations. Adopt systems that will help in maximizing time. An extra hour in your business is a resource worth pursuing. 4. Stock Auditing\nThe stock audit is the physical verification of the inventory assets of a company. Auditing your inventory is not an exciting process. Yet, it is crucial for effective inventory management. Moving thousands of items increases the risk of unnoticed loses or damages. Failure to track your stock can lead to business disappointments. Imagine taking and processing a customer order only to realize the item is not in stock? You might lose customer credibility just because of not auditing your stock. Regular stock auditing notifies you on items that are out of stock. Have an up-to-date warehouse to avoid losing sales. Entrepreneurs such as restaurant owners need to make regular audits to maintain customer satisfaction. You can get restaurant inventory management software to control inventory and optimize the ordering process. Stock auditing is necessary for any industry. It will allow you to identify discrepancies and curtail cases of theft and employee malpractices. You can shop for software that can help in regular auditing to have an update on the available stock. 5.\n\nAccording to a recent National Retail Federation (NRF) study, US retailers lose billions of dollars yearly due to overstocks, stockouts, and other inventory-related issues. This equates to billions of dollars in lost revenue each year. Effective demand planning is a necessary process that helps companies mitigate these losses by accurately predicting customer demand for their products and services. By clearly understanding what customers want and when they want it, companies can make informed decisions about inventory levels and avoid the costs associated with overstock and stockouts. In this article, we will discuss the importance of demand planning for better inventory management, including the benefits, best practices, and challenges involved. By understanding the key concepts and techniques involved in demand planning, companies can develop more effective strategies for managing their inventory and meeting the needs of their customers.

Demand planning is the process of predicting the future demand for a product or service based on various factors such as historical sales, market trends, and customer behavior. - It is an essential aspect of inventory management that helps businesses make informed decisions about how much product to manufacture or purchase when to do it, and how to distribute it. - Demand planning aims to align the supply of goods with customer demand to ensure enough inventory to meet customer needs while reducing excess stock. - Accurate demand planning is critical for businesses because it helps reduce the risk of stock shortages and overproduction. - By predicting demand, companies can ensure that they have the right amount of inventory on hand to meet customer needs, which can improve customer satisfaction and increase sales. On the other hand, overproduction can result in excess inventory and wasted resources, leading to increased costs and reduced profits. Optimize With Inventory on Demand\nInventory on demand is a management method that helps businesses optimize their inventory levels by keeping only the amount of stock needed to meet current customer demand. This approach allows companies to reduce the cost of excess inventory and improve overall inventory management. - Supports Just-In-Time (JIT) Inventory Management: Inventory on demand supports Just-In-Time (JIT) inventory management, which is an approach to inventory management that involves keeping only the minimum amount of inventory needed to meet customer demand. JIT helps reduce inventory carrying costs and improves supply chain efficiency. - Supports Sales and Marketing Efforts: Inventory on demand provides businesses with the information they need to make informed decisions about production, purchasing, and distribution, supporting sales and marketing efforts. - Increases Visibility and Control: Inventory on demand helps businesses gain visibility into their inventory levels and improve control over their inventory management processes, reducing the risk of stock shortages and improving overall supply chain efficiency. - Enhances Responsiveness: Inventory on demand helps businesses respond more quickly to changes in customer demand, ensuring that they have the right products in stock when customers want them. - Supports Inventory Optimization: Inventory on demand supports inventory optimization, which involves balancing inventory costs and stock shortage costs to find the optimal inventory level. Inventory optimization helps businesses improve their overall inventory management and increase profits. Steps for Developing a Demand Planning Strategy\nThe first step in developing a demand planning strategy is to gather data. This data can include historical sales data, market research, and information about the competitive landscape. This data will provide a foundation for making informed decisions about production, purchasing, and distribution. The next step is to analyze the data that has been gathered. This analysis should focus on identifying trends, patterns, and other information that can inform the demand planning process. For example, research may reveal that sales of a particular product are highest during a specific time of year or that a new competitor has entered the market. Develop a Demand Forecast\nThe next step is to develop a demand forecast based on the gathered and analyzed data. This forecast should be based on the best available information and consider factors such as seasonality, trends, and market conditions. Determine Inventory Levels\nThe next step is determining the appropriate inventory levels for each product based on the demand forecast.\n\n- Utilizing technology: The demand planner uses technology and software, such as demand planning software, to automate and streamline the demand planning process.

Here are some best practices for demand planning:\n- Collaborate with cross-functional teams: Collaboration between sales, marketing, and supply chain teams is essential for effective demand planning. The demand planner should work closely with these teams to gather relevant data, understand market trends, and develop a demand plan aligned with company goals and objectives. - Utilize technology: Technology and software, such as demand planning software, can automate and streamline the demand planning process. The demand planner should be familiar with the latest technology and tools and use them to gather and analyze data, develop demand plans, and monitor progress. - Regularly review and update the demand plan: The demand plan should be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect changes in market conditions, customer behavior, and company goals. The demand planner should be proactive in identifying trends and making necessary adjustments to the demand plan. - Consider historical data and trends: Historical data and trends are a valuable source of information for demand planning. The demand planner should consider this data when developing the demand plan, considering factors such as seasonality, promotions, and other events that may impact demand. - Incorporate forecasting methods: Several forecasting methods can be used for demand planning, each with its own advantages and limitations. The demand planner should know these methods and choose the best approach for the analyzed product and market. Challenges in Demand Planning to Manage Inventory\nDemand planning is essential for inventory management and ensuring that products and services are available to customers when and where they are needed. However, demand planning also comes with its own set of challenges that can impact the accuracy of the demand plan and lead to inefficiencies in the supply chain. Here are some of the challenges in demand planning:\n- Uncertainty and volatility in demand: Changes in market conditions, customer behavior, and economic conditions can create uncertainty and volatility in demand. This can make it challenging to develop an accurate demand plan and manage inventory levels effectively. - Limited data and resources: The demand planner may have limited data and resources available to develop the demand plan. This can make it difficult to gather relevant information, analyze trends, and make informed decisions. - Integration with other processes and systems: Demand planning should be integrated with other processes and systems within the company, including sales and marketing, supply chain, and logistics. However, this can be challenging if different departments use different systems and processes. - Limited visibility into demand signals: The demand planner may have limited visibility into demand signals, such as customer orders and shipments, which can impact the accuracy of the demand plan. - Inaccurate forecasting: Inaccurate forecasting can lead to incorrect demand plans and impact inventory levels. This can result in stockouts, overstocks, and inefficient use of resources. - Resistance to change: Companies may resist change, making it challenging to implement new demand planning processes or technologies.

Inventory management and tracking services can help you stay on top of your stock levels, ensuring that you have the right amount of products on hand at all times. From tracking inventory levels to forecasting demand, these services can save you time and money while providing you with the peace of mind that your inventory is in good shape. With so many inventory management and tracking services on the market, it can be difficult to choose the right one for your needs. This article will provide an overview of the different types of services available and discuss the benefits they can offer. What is Inventory Management and Tracking?Inventory management and tracking is a process of managing and tracking inventory items, such as raw materials, parts, and finished products. It is typically done using a software system that tracks the quantity, location, and status of the items in the inventory. This system also helps with the ordering, storage, and delivery of items. The goal of inventory management and tracking is to ensure that a business has enough inventory to meet customer demand while minimizing costs. Benefits of Inventory Management and Tracking ServicesInventory management and tracking services provide businesses with a number of benefits, including improved accuracy and efficiency in managing inventory, better customer service, reduced costs, and improved product availability. By using an inventory management system, businesses can track the flow of goods through their warehouses or stores, allowing them to better manage their stock levels. This helps to reduce costs by preventing over-ordering or under-ordering of goods. Additionally, it allows businesses to quickly identify and respond to customer orders or stock shortages. Common Solutions for Inventory Management and Tracking ServicesThere are several common solutions for inventory management and tracking services. These include barcoding systems, RFID technology, and software-based inventory systems. Barcoding systems are used to track inventory items by scanning barcodes on the items. RFID technology uses radio frequencies to track the location and status of items. Software-based systems provide an automated way to manage inventory by tracking item information, such as quantity, location, and status. Best Practices for Implementing Inventory Management and Tracking ServicesWhen implementing an inventory management system, there are several best practices that should be followed. First, businesses should define the scope of their inventory management system by determining what needs to be tracked. This includes identifying the types of items that need to be tracked, as well as any other information that needs to be recorded such as expiration dates and minimum quantities. Additionally, businesses should choose a system that meets their needs in terms of scalability, ease of use, cost effectiveness, and integration with other systems. Challenges in Inventory Management and Tracking ServicesOne of the main challenges with inventory management and tracking services is maintaining accurate data. If data is inaccurate or incomplete, it can lead to incorrect decisions being made about stock levels or customer orders. To prevent this from happening, businesses should ensure they have processes in place for verifying data accuracy on a regular basis. Additionally, businesses should regularly review their inventory processes to ensure they are efficient and effective. ConclusionInventory management and tracking services are essential for businesses looking to optimize their operations and ensure efficient storage and stock control. By implementing an inventory management system, businesses can benefit from improved accuracy in managing their inventory, better customer service, reduced costs, and improved product availability. Additionally, businesses should follow best practices when implementing an inventory management system such as defining the scope of the system, choosing the right system for their needs, and maintaining accurate data. In conclusion, inventory management and tracking services are essential for businesses looking to optimize their operations and ensure efficient storage and stock control.

It will come as no surprise, however, that the majority of small and medium-sized businesses don’t operate best practices when it comes to their inventory. To say that current practices are on the sloppy side would be polite. Many businesses fall into the trap of overstocking items, just in case there is a sudden glut of demand on the market. The problem with this is that it worsens the condition of the balance sheet while at the same time, forcing you to increase the space that you dedicate to storing stock. Overall, it pushes up your costs and makes your firm less competitive. In this article, we’re going to investigate how you can get inventive with inventory. So, let’s take a look. Get A Third Party To Track Stock\nIf you run a small business, then the chances are that you don’t have the time or resources to develop your own stock tracking system, allowing you to see what you’ve got in stock and what’s on order at any given moment. The good news, however, is that you don’t need to do any of this yourself: it can all be overseen by a third party. Take dental practices, for instance. Many track dental purchases using a third-party system rather than attempting to do it themselves. Not only does this help bring down costs, but it also improves the patient experience. Customers no longer have to worry about not getting the items that they need. It’s all automated, reducing the chance of error. Be Consistent With How You Manage Incoming Inventory\nLarge businesses make sure that the way that they manage incoming inventory is the same every time to avoid things like shrinkage and double counting. But small companies don’t operate at the same level of rigor. Often each individual in the firm has their own way of receiving new inventory, creating tracking issues. It’s a good idea, therefore, to develop a standard system with your staff so that each person in your organization knows how they should receive stock in the future. Doing this will help you verify that you’ve received the right items, saving you money in the long-term. Update Inventory Totals Daily\nIt might seem basic, but many small businesses don’t update their inventories at the end of the working day. This is a problem. If you don’t track sales, then you won’t know what’s sold and what needs to be ordered in larger quantities. Tracking sales allows you to see seasonal variations in demand, as well as day-to-day demand fluctuations which could help you better manage stock overall. Conduct An Inventory Audit\nDo you know what’s in your inventory? Or have you just been guessing for the last few months since you last took stock? Many successful businesses audit their inventory on a daily or weekly basis. Not only does this allow you to match up the real levels of your stock to what you think you have, but it also shows you which products are your most popular.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:31ac7c02-c97c-4d91-bd63-2eef3918c997>"]},{"passage":"5 Inventory Planning Best Practices\nIn a session we co-presented at the recent National Conference on Operations & Fulfillment in Las Vegas, we led a panel that delivered the following top five inventory planning best practices:\n- Build partnerships with suppliers. View your suppliers as subordinates and they’ll simply do your bidding. Work with them as partners and you’ll succeed together. You'll achieve more sales — with higher fulfillment, fewer overstocks and better inventory turnover — if you have a partner relationship with suppliers. Communicate with suppliers comprehensively and often. If they can anticipate your needs, they have a better chance of having raw materials and manufacturing capacity available when you need it. Establish these relationships so suppliers can tell you any bad news before delays in production or delivery impact your business. - Capture shadow or lost demand. Incomplete or inaccurate demand data leads to faulty demand planning and inaccurate purchasing decisions. What's more, it negatively impacts staff efficiency. Without accurate demand data, merchants can make incorrect decisions about strong vs. weak sellers. In addition, not capturing lost demand understates response rates and average order size, potentially impacting future list selection. - Measure both order and item fulfillment. Order fulfillment is the best measure of customer satisfaction. It gauges the percentage of customers that are shipped their orders complete at the time of order. The best measure of inventory buying performance is item fulfillment. This measures the percentage of individual items that are shipped to customers when ordered. Understand the relationship between the two so individual inventory buyers can comprehend their impact on total customer experience. - Forecast Internet demand. With Web sales growing to more than 50 percent of total sales for many catalogers, there's growing concern about how best to forecast. First, understand the true source of the demand. On average, only 10 percent to 20 percent of Internet demand is truly “incremental” and not driven by other media. There are two main approaches to online forecasting: time-phased modeling and traditional offer-based forecasting with demand curves. Both are valid. Ensure that you understand the marketing dynamics of your business to apply the appropriate mix of the two forecasting models. For details, see Ray Goodman’s March 2009 Catalog Success article, “Grab the Bull by Both Horns.”\n- Build processes for speed. Every day yields new information to consider. Success is directly related to the speed of receiving, processing and acting on new information. Whether it’s reforecasting demand, placing new purchase orders or adjusting existing ones, build systems and processes that maximize speed.

You must have a pretty overwhelming to-do list on your hands right about now, and managing your inventory is probably close to the top. Because most start-ups don’t have the cash to splash on an inventory-managing robot, we thought we’d share some advice on how to manage and organise your own inventory. Invest in Organisational Shelves and Products\nYes, cardboard boxes are great. And bags are handy too. But when it comes to your inventory, you need to take it up a notch to keep things organised and easy to find. If your small business or online store is blossoming from your spare room or garage, consider installing shelves and drawers for your stock. Then grab yourself a labeller to mark out certain spaces for certain products. Things will have their own designated place and you’ll be able to grab what you need without rustling through boxes and bags on the ground. Implement a Logical Layout\nSo the pink dog raincoats are flying out the door. But the green ones? Not so much. Take your product demand and turnover into account when organising a layout for your inventory. Put simply, you should keep stuff you always need (or frequently sell) at the front of your shelves or the top of your drawers, and stuff you don’t often need at the back or bottom. This will make your daily operations more efficient and make you 78%* less likely to split your pants while squatting down to grab stuff each day. *Totally fabricated statistic. National Storage cannot be held liable for any split pants. There really is an app for everything (there’s even one to train your bird to talk), and there’s no exception when it comes to getting your inventory on track. Try these helpful apps to keep your stock organised. $4.49 | Available on iPhone and iPad\nThis handy app is a lifesaver when it comes to tracking your inventory. When you buy new stock, you tell the app. As you receive, sell, ship and deliver items, you let the app know. This allows you to see everything in your inventory, their statuses, and your profits whenever you want. Inventory Now provides a simple stock overview that doesn’t leave you scratching your head and reaching for a calculator. $4.99 | Available on iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch\nSave money on dud stock by keeping an eye on sales trends with this app. On Shelf tells you what items are in stock and what items need reordering, and the barcode feature allows you to enter sales in a flash. If you want to know which items sell and which items you shouldn’t bother with, On Shelf is your guy. Or girl. At this point in time, we don’t know what gender – if any – On Shelf identifies as. Use A Self-Storage Unit\nWe’ve said it before and we’ll say it again – there really is nothing National Storage can’t do (except juggle; that is bloody tricky). Starting a business is also tricky, especially when it comes to finding a home for all your growing paperwork and inventory. If keeping boxes of files and stock in your garage isn’t really working for you, our business storage is the perfect solution. Some of our centres even offer a records management service for those of you who are feeling extra lazy. Just kidding! It really does take a lot of work off your hands, though.

It’s an economical and practical solution, which can alleviate some of the burden of the working or retail space. To help manage inventory and supplies in self-storage, we offer these tips:\nRecord your Inventory for easy access later\nTo avoid confusion later on and to keep track of your inventory and supplies, make a list of everything you plan to store. Group your items in a way that makes sense to your business. Make copies of your inventory—one to keep in the office and one to keep at the storage unit. Remember to update the inventory each time you retrieve items from, or add to, the unit. Decide on the Type of Storage you need\nYour inventory or supplies might need to be placed in a controlled temperature or humidity environment. If you are storing items such as antiques, art or rare books, you might want to consider climate-controlled storage. At Moishe’s Self Storage, we offer a wide variety of unit sizes and can even provide you with custom units to accommodate any size inventory.

And with the latest in security features – like motion detectors, closed-circuit monitors and fire suppression technology – you can be sure that your business inventory is in good hands. We offer convenient storage locations in Queens and the Bronx, so you’re never too far away from your belongings. Pack items properly\nPay attention to how you pack. Find boxes appropriate to each group of items while considering how often you will need to open each box and therefore sealing it in a way that accommodates your needs. For example, if you plan on opening a box each week to grab papers out of, you might opt for a file box and seal it in a way that’s easy to open. Pay Attention to the Order of Boxes\nPut the things you’ll need more frequently closer to the front of the unit and items you’ll use less frequently in the back.

That's why laying the right foundation with a scalable solution is critical for growth. Luckily, Method is here to help. Below we outline what inventory management entails, its benefits, and the techniques and best practices that make for good inventory management. We'll also dig into how digitization can enable efficiency and make life easier for employees, so they can get on with taking care of patients. Inventory management is the tracking and managing of inventory from the purchase of goods through to their sale or usage. Tracking inventory allows you to identify when it's time to order and how much to order, ensuring you always have enough stock of the right supplies to service your patients. Learning to manage your inventory is the first step in gaining control of your spending so you can stay within budget, minimize waste and leverage your purchasing volumes to reduce costs and improve profits. Although your supply inventory is needed to produce revenue, it also ties up cash. Too much inventory impedes your cash flow and puts you at risk of financial hits from expired, lost, or damaged stock. This is why inventory turnover (how long your inventory sits before it is used) is a good measurement of your inventory management. Inventory management is a key component of an organization's financial health, as it ensures you carry the appropriate amount of stock to suit your business needs. Carrying too much stock ties up cash and puts you at risk of loss, damaged or expired inventory. But too little inventory can lead to stockouts, damaging your patient care and revenue. Proper inventory management can also help save you money. By understanding your usage, you can leverage your purchasing volumes for cost savings and take advantage of economies of scale. Inventory management can save you on soft costs (indirect costs such as labor) and make life easier for your employees. By removing the guesswork from buying supplies, streamlining processes, and organizing supplies, employees can more easily reorder supplies and quickly find what they need when they need it. Your dental office is a busy place. But, by taking some moments to review and establish some essential inventory management processes, you can remove some of the chaos while improving profits. It's a win-win for employees and your balance sheet, providing you with a systematic, scalable approach to managing inventory that optimizes profits and supports future growth. For dental practices, the goal of inventory management is to know your stock levels, where that stock is located, and identify when it is time to order more and in what quantities. At its most basic level, the process works by tracking your current stock levels and then adjusting inventory down, as it is used, and up, upon receipt of deliveries. As no system is perfectly executed, inventory counts will lose accuracy over time. Therefore, physical inventory counts are performed to audit, validate and adjust inventory levels as needed to increase accuracy. The process begins when you identify the requirement for a specific supply. The item is then sourced, a vendor selected, and an order placed and tracked. Upon delivery and verification of the received item, quantity, and condition (the product must be in good order and fit for use), the quantity received is then adjusted into inventory. The inventory management process also involves organizing storage and analyzing future requirements by taking into consideration factors that may impact usages such as growth, scheduled services, or holidays to ensure inventory levels suffice and are used as efficiently as possible. Below we've listed nine good-to-know inventory management terms and techniques most relevant to the dental industry. These are the methods and processes that help you to balance your priorities, keeping your practice safe from disruption while taking into consideration the availability of resources and profits.The point is not to implement all these processes at once, but to choose what is most imperative for your practice and make small but ongoing improvements over time — because small changes lead to big impacts.

Inventory planning enables businesses to purchase the appropriate amount of goods and determine how frequently to replenish. Inventory planning assists in lowering the cost of stocking things and ensuring that there is sufficient stock for manufacturing and selling items. Inventory management is a significant component of supply chain management. According to research, the 80\/20 rule implies that 80% of outcomes originate from 20% of efforts, customers, or another unit of measurement. When applied to inventories, the rule means that businesses generate approximately 80% of their revenues from 20% of their products. Benefits of Inventory Planning\nInventory control and planning are two processes part of inventory management. Planning and controlling are critical to management success, as with every management process. The rationale for such a strong emphasis on inventory is that it typically represents a corporation’s most significant cash-flow component. This is true for both purchasing and selling merchandise. As a result, inventory management directly impacts the organization’s financial health. Inventory control and planning benefit small firms in the following ways:\nInventory Management Strategies\nInventory management is a highly adaptable aspect of the company. Each business has a unique inventory control strategy. However, every organization should seek to eliminate human error as much as possible from inventory management, which includes utilizing inventory management software. Regardless of the method you employ, the following will help you manage your inventory more effectively—and increase your cash flow. 1. Six Sigma\nSix Sigma is a methodology and toolkit for enhancing business processes. It is used in inventory and supply chain management to minimize excess and obsolete write-offs. This inventory is frequently sold below cost or donated, which results in a loss of revenue for small business owners. Having the appropriate stock to meet demand minimizes waste and variation issues. Six Sigma is an excellent way of resolving inventory issues. It is orderly and dependable. 2. Set par levels\nSet par levels for each of your goods to simplify inventory management. Par levels are the bare minimum amount of product that must always be on hand. When your inventory falls below certain specified levels, it’s time to place more orders. Ideally, you’ll order the smallest quantity necessary to return above par. Par levels vary by product and determine the speed of an item sells and the time required to restock. While establishing par levels needs some study and decision-making upfront, they will streamline the ordering process. Not only will this make decision-making more accessible for you, but it will also empower your team to make decisions on your behalf. Bear in mind that circumstances change over time. Verify par levels many times a year to ensure they remain reasonable. Meanwhile, don’t be scared to tweak your par levels upward or below. First-in, first-out (FIFO) is a critical inventory management philosophy. This means that your oldest stock is sold first (first in), not your newest store. This is critical for perishable products to avoid unsellable spoiling. Additionally, FIFO is an intelligent technique for non-perishable products. If the same boxes are constantly relegated to the back, they are more prone to wear out. Also, packaging design and functionalities frequently evolve. You don’t want to ramble up with something any longer marketable. To handle a FIFO system effectively, you’ll need a well-organized warehouse. This often entails adding fresh items from the back or otherwise ensuring that existing inventory remains initially. If you’re operating with a warehousing and fulfillment provider, they’re likely already doing this, but it’s prudent to confirm. 4. Relationship management\nSuccessful inventory management requires the ability to adapt fast. Whether you need to return a slow-selling item to make place for a new product, swiftly replenish a high-volume seller, solve manufacturing concerns, or temporarily extend your storage space, it’s critical to maintain a solid relationship with your suppliers. In this manner, they’ll be more receptive to collaborating with you to resolve issues. Maintaining a positive relationship with your product suppliers, in particular, is critical. Frequently, minimum order amounts are negotiable.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:5a635d65-91b5-4cbb-818d-e594037efb57>"]},{"passage":"Inventory shrink in the United States cost the retail industry about $46.8 billion. A business must have an efficient system of inventory management. The process involves tracking the stock and inventory life cycle once it gets to your business. If you aren’t aware of your inventory, decision making becomes problematic. Whether you are a brick-and-mortar or an online retailer, inventory management is imperative. With the different techniques available, you can’t miss a solution that will work for your business. What are the secrets small businesses can use to save money on inventory management? Learn how to manage inventories more effectively now. One principle of inventory management you ought to consider is the first-in, first-out approach. This inventory method ensures you sell your old stock first. It is especially vital when selling perishable products that might end up as spoilage. The first in, first out approach, commonly referred to as FIFO, also applies to non-perishables. Items can be worn out over time, that’s why storing them for long isn’t advisable. What’s more, the packaging designs keep changing. You need to restructure your warehouse in a way that encourages FIFO. Have a back door to ensure that the new products are at the backside. When the old products are at the front, the chances are that they will sell before the new entrants. 2. Use a Real-time and Centralized Database\nThe days of pen and paper in-store inventory control are over. Companies are adopting efficient options such as Excel to manage inventory. Nonetheless, the use of paper is still evident though minimal. With today’s dynamic business environment, inventory management should be within a centralized database. A supply chain has multiple users. A centralized system will allow all users to access the database in real-time. An inventory tracking system allows you to check products from the point the supplier delivers up until it reaches the customer. You need to note down the description and value of each item. Analyze the time the supplier takes to deliver. You can see the stock at this stage and plan. The timely interventions will save you money and waste. Besides, you’ll know if it’s necessary to make any adjustments at each point of the supply chain. Recent research projects that automation will reduce the need for office support by 20%. Industries are adopting automation because of increased efficiency. If you’ve been wondering how to manage inventories, automation can be an ideal option. Inputting data manually can be time-consuming and full of errors. The process is repetitive and can be quite daunting for your employees. Save your workers the overwhelming tasks and automate some processes. Automating most of your inventory management processes can increase scale-able. If you have to email and call your suppliers and workers each day to know the amount of inventory, it means that your business isn’t scale-able. Automated systems allow you to gather information faster. Automation decreases human error that’s imminent when making manual entries. Consequently, you might undersell or oversell your items. Automation allows you to edit or upgrade inventory at any time. With automated inventory processes, you don’t need to spend hours analyzing data at the expense of other business operations. Adopt systems that will help in maximizing time. An extra hour in your business is a resource worth pursuing. 4. Stock Auditing\nThe stock audit is the physical verification of the inventory assets of a company. Auditing your inventory is not an exciting process. Yet, it is crucial for effective inventory management. Moving thousands of items increases the risk of unnoticed loses or damages. Failure to track your stock can lead to business disappointments. Imagine taking and processing a customer order only to realize the item is not in stock? You might lose customer credibility just because of not auditing your stock. Regular stock auditing notifies you on items that are out of stock. Have an up-to-date warehouse to avoid losing sales. Entrepreneurs such as restaurant owners need to make regular audits to maintain customer satisfaction. You can get restaurant inventory management software to control inventory and optimize the ordering process. Stock auditing is necessary for any industry. It will allow you to identify discrepancies and curtail cases of theft and employee malpractices. You can shop for software that can help in regular auditing to have an update on the available stock. 5.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:1f97aaec-d661-4b13-8d62-718165e892c7>"]},{"passage":"According to a recent National Retail Federation (NRF) study, US retailers lose billions of dollars yearly due to overstocks, stockouts, and other inventory-related issues. This equates to billions of dollars in lost revenue each year. Effective demand planning is a necessary process that helps companies mitigate these losses by accurately predicting customer demand for their products and services. By clearly understanding what customers want and when they want it, companies can make informed decisions about inventory levels and avoid the costs associated with overstock and stockouts. In this article, we will discuss the importance of demand planning for better inventory management, including the benefits, best practices, and challenges involved. By understanding the key concepts and techniques involved in demand planning, companies can develop more effective strategies for managing their inventory and meeting the needs of their customers. Here’s what we shall cover in this post:\n- What is Demand Planning? - Optimize With Inventory on Demand\n- Steps for Developing a Demand Planning Strategy\n- Demand Planning Methods\n- What does a Demand Planner Do? - Demand Planning Best Practices for Better Inventory Management\n- Challenges in Demand Planning to Manage Inventory\n- Key Takeaways\nWhat is Demand Planning? Demand planning is the process of predicting the future demand for a product or service based on various factors such as historical sales, market trends, and customer behavior. - It is an essential aspect of inventory management that helps businesses make informed decisions about how much product to manufacture or purchase when to do it, and how to distribute it. - Demand planning aims to align the supply of goods with customer demand to ensure enough inventory to meet customer needs while reducing excess stock. - Accurate demand planning is critical for businesses because it helps reduce the risk of stock shortages and overproduction. - By predicting demand, companies can ensure that they have the right amount of inventory on hand to meet customer needs, which can improve customer satisfaction and increase sales. On the other hand, overproduction can result in excess inventory and wasted resources, leading to increased costs and reduced profits. Optimize With Inventory on Demand\nInventory on demand is a management method that helps businesses optimize their inventory levels by keeping only the amount of stock needed to meet current customer demand. This approach allows companies to reduce the cost of excess inventory and improve overall inventory management. - Supports Just-In-Time (JIT) Inventory Management: Inventory on demand supports Just-In-Time (JIT) inventory management, which is an approach to inventory management that involves keeping only the minimum amount of inventory needed to meet customer demand. JIT helps reduce inventory carrying costs and improves supply chain efficiency. - Supports Sales and Marketing Efforts: Inventory on demand provides businesses with the information they need to make informed decisions about production, purchasing, and distribution, supporting sales and marketing efforts. - Increases Visibility and Control: Inventory on demand helps businesses gain visibility into their inventory levels and improve control over their inventory management processes, reducing the risk of stock shortages and improving overall supply chain efficiency. - Enhances Responsiveness: Inventory on demand helps businesses respond more quickly to changes in customer demand, ensuring that they have the right products in stock when customers want them. - Supports Inventory Optimization: Inventory on demand supports inventory optimization, which involves balancing inventory costs and stock shortage costs to find the optimal inventory level. Inventory optimization helps businesses improve their overall inventory management and increase profits. Steps for Developing a Demand Planning Strategy\nThe first step in developing a demand planning strategy is to gather data. This data can include historical sales data, market research, and information about the competitive landscape. This data will provide a foundation for making informed decisions about production, purchasing, and distribution. The next step is to analyze the data that has been gathered. This analysis should focus on identifying trends, patterns, and other information that can inform the demand planning process. For example, research may reveal that sales of a particular product are highest during a specific time of year or that a new competitor has entered the market. Develop a Demand Forecast\nThe next step is to develop a demand forecast based on the gathered and analyzed data. This forecast should be based on the best available information and consider factors such as seasonality, trends, and market conditions. Determine Inventory Levels\nThe next step is determining the appropriate inventory levels for each product based on the demand forecast.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:c82600dc-1ca6-4f8d-89fd-e6ba031b0706>"]},{"passage":"- Utilizing technology: The demand planner uses technology and software, such as demand planning software, to automate and streamline the demand planning process. Demand Planning Best Practices for Better Inventory Management\nEffective demand planning can help minimize costs, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize sales. Here are some best practices for demand planning:\n- Collaborate with cross-functional teams: Collaboration between sales, marketing, and supply chain teams is essential for effective demand planning. The demand planner should work closely with these teams to gather relevant data, understand market trends, and develop a demand plan aligned with company goals and objectives. - Utilize technology: Technology and software, such as demand planning software, can automate and streamline the demand planning process. The demand planner should be familiar with the latest technology and tools and use them to gather and analyze data, develop demand plans, and monitor progress. - Regularly review and update the demand plan: The demand plan should be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect changes in market conditions, customer behavior, and company goals. The demand planner should be proactive in identifying trends and making necessary adjustments to the demand plan. - Consider historical data and trends: Historical data and trends are a valuable source of information for demand planning. The demand planner should consider this data when developing the demand plan, considering factors such as seasonality, promotions, and other events that may impact demand. - Incorporate forecasting methods: Several forecasting methods can be used for demand planning, each with its own advantages and limitations. The demand planner should know these methods and choose the best approach for the analyzed product and market. Challenges in Demand Planning to Manage Inventory\nDemand planning is essential for inventory management and ensuring that products and services are available to customers when and where they are needed. However, demand planning also comes with its own set of challenges that can impact the accuracy of the demand plan and lead to inefficiencies in the supply chain. Here are some of the challenges in demand planning:\n- Uncertainty and volatility in demand: Changes in market conditions, customer behavior, and economic conditions can create uncertainty and volatility in demand. This can make it challenging to develop an accurate demand plan and manage inventory levels effectively. - Limited data and resources: The demand planner may have limited data and resources available to develop the demand plan. This can make it difficult to gather relevant information, analyze trends, and make informed decisions. - Integration with other processes and systems: Demand planning should be integrated with other processes and systems within the company, including sales and marketing, supply chain, and logistics. However, this can be challenging if different departments use different systems and processes. - Limited visibility into demand signals: The demand planner may have limited visibility into demand signals, such as customer orders and shipments, which can impact the accuracy of the demand plan. - Inaccurate forecasting: Inaccurate forecasting can lead to incorrect demand plans and impact inventory levels. This can result in stockouts, overstocks, and inefficient use of resources. - Resistance to change: Companies may resist change, making it challenging to implement new demand planning processes or technologies. This can limit the ability to improve demand planning accuracy and efficiency. How Deskera Can Assist You?

During this legislative session, Sen. Randi Becker R-Eatonville, proposed a bill that would allow 20 school districts of up to 2,200 students to use the four-day school week. Here, Don Kordosky, superintendent of Oregon's Oakridge School District, shares his personal experience and insights on making the switch. When considering the switch from a five-day school week to a four-day school week, one need only recall that classic saying: “Less is more.”\nAs superintendent of Oakridge School District in Oregon, I learned this through personal experience when my schools made the switch. Initially, I was against the idea. How could a four-day week possibly be in the best interest of students? But after doing the research and seeing the benefits firsthand, I became a complete supporter. The positives of the four-day week far outweigh the negatives, and the negatives can all be alleviated through well-thought-out strategies. The parents of our students, the staff, the school board, and the entire community of Oakridge reviewed the four-day week for an entire year prior to implementation. Since implementation I have become a four-day week advocate because of all the positive attributes including: better student academic performance, increased teacher vitality, increased student engagement, decreased student discipline problems, and an improvement to the overall culture of excellence for the district. Most school districts originally begin a review of the four-day school week as a strategy to address financial shortfalls. (Mine did not.) By trimming one day off the week, a school can save in bus services, cafeteria, and facilities costs. This can be especially crucial during state budget shortfalls, where K-12 funding can be in danger of cuts, and even more so for rural school districts, which must run their schools on a minimal budget. But not all school districts go to a four-day week because of money, and certainly it is not the only way a school can benefit from the change. The four-day week is not for all districts, and there are negative attributes that need to have alleviation strategies in place prior to implementation. Negative attributes include parent fears of not being able to find child care on Fridays, fatigue for students that have to attend school for longer days, and decreases in compensation for employees who lose hours. An example of an alleviation strategy for the child care concern is the offering of Red Cross Childcare First Aid certification classes for high school students. These students then became available for parents who could not find relatives or other child care on Fridays. Another strategy is offering extra duty employment for bus drivers, cooks, and custodians, who all lose significant hours. In our district we made it a practice to offer all paid athletic supervision and activity duties to the employees who lost work time prior to other employees. Regardless of the negative consequence associated with the four-day week, there are strategies to alleviate the negative impact on students, families and staff. Of note, many parents have found that eliminating the large number of half-days for students that plague five-day weeks — such as teacher work days, curriculum days, grading days, inservice days, etc. — has made finding childcare easier. With the four-day week, teachers can do their non-teaching activities on the day off, and therefore schools do not have to send children home at awkward and inconsistent times. However, what I have found is that most common four-day school week objections are derived more from a fear of change (and a indeed a reasonable concern) rather than empirical study. When scrutinized, these objections are both addressed and debunked by the switch. To demonstrate that point, here are four reasons why the four-day school week is an improvement to the five-day week. Teacher and student attendance increases. Teachers are the key to student learning, and having the regular classroom teacher in the room instead of a substitute teacher is better for kids. Because teachers are able to schedule meetings, doctor’s appointments and other possible conflicts with their teaching schedule on the extra day off, teachers are better able to provide a consistency for students. In Oakridge, the number of available work hours missed by teachers decreased significantly (21.8%) after the move to a four-day school week. Student attendance typically increases, too.\n\nMost districts that implement a four-day week see substantial improvement in attendance at the high school level per available instructional hours (they spend more time learning, but less days at school). Attendance in some schools increased 3% as measured against available instructional hours. Contrary to fears, instructional time for students can increase from what it was before if it is the wish of the school district. By subtracting non-teaching activities from Fridays (lunch time, passing periods, transportation time, recess) and adding those paid teacher work hours to instructional hours Monday-Thursday, the amount of paid teacher time that is allocated to instruction increases. Each school day is comprised of many activities that have no direct positive correlation to student academic achievement. The time we pay teachers when they are not teaching includes before school starts (usually about 30 minutes), the time that society pays teachers after school (usually 45 minutes), passing periods (typically six passing periods of five minutes each equals 30 minutes). All of this “non-instructional time” on Fridays is eliminated and that time can be changed to instructional time on the other remaining four days. Also, the flexibility of the four-day week allows it to work around national holidays, so even if a Monday needs to be taken off — say, for Labor Day — students can still go to school for four days (Monday-Friday). The four-day school week offers four days of instruction every week, not the inconsistency of the five-day week which often has only three, three and one-half, or four days of student instruction. This is one of the keys to the four-day week: Instead of sending kids home so that teachers can do non-instructional duties you bring teachers in on Fridays to complete non-instructional tasks! On the four-day week, student discipline decreases and student engagement increases. The commonly assumed reason for the decrease in student discipline is that students are more actively engaged in more strenuous and rigorous classes than on a five-day week. Keep in mind that student seat time typically increases in the move from a five-day week to a four-day week, so claims that student discipline incidents decrease because they are in school for less time is not a viable argument. Also, teachers commonly reflect upon the change from a five-day to a four-day week that students work harder, are engaged more, and learn more. Teachers have noted that there is increased intrinsic motivation to cover material in fewer days with more instructional time, and that students adjust to increased expectations by becoming more engaged. Moreover, the extra instructional time allows teachers to better teach more complicated subjects, which can otherwise be a problem especially in math and sciences. Perhaps most importantly, teacher vitality and morale increases tremendously. Teaching is an extremely difficult job, where it is common for teachers to spend long nights and weekends assessing student work and preparing. Any teacher worth their salt does not work only “to the contract” work hours, but does everything they can in their non-working hours to provide as many learning opportunities for their students as possible. On a five-day week it is not uncommon to see teachers work late on Friday nights grading and assessing the week’s student work. Saturdays are often spent working on preparation for the next week’s worth of lessons, leaving Sundays to reinvigorate and spend time with their families. As a result, teachers often start the school year each September bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, ready to face new challenges. But by February, many become exhausted. The four-day week, even though each instructional day is longer, provides three days for teachers to complete needed work and spend some much-needed time with their families. This simple fact increases teacher morale, decreases teacher turnover, and improves teacher vitality. This leads to happier and more energetic teachers, which results in better education for students. Don't let nostalgia for an antiquated tradition cloud your mind — take a few minutes and read about the four-day week and get the facts. Plan for the negative attributes, maximize the positive attributes, and make sure that the community is thoroughly involved in the implementation process. The best way to ensure the failure of the implementation of the four-day week is to “do it to the community, instead of “doing it with the community.”\n\nFour-Day School Week Is on the Rise, Story Says\nThe idea of a four-day school week is nothing new. It's long been embraced by some small, rural school districts. But a new Associated Press story suggests the practice is spreading amid budget pressures on school systems. Featured is a 4,000-student rural district in Peach County, Ga., where school officials reportedly shifted last year to a four-day schedule to help fill a $1 million budget shortfall. What's intriguing is that both student attendance and standardized test scores have since improved. (Apparently, each school day is longer to make up for lost time.) Across the country, more than 120 districts operate on a four-day week, the AP story says. (If only employers of education journalists would embrace this idea!) Also, over the past couple of years, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Maine have changed state law so that districts can count their academic year by hour rather than days, so that a four-day week is possible, the story says. Nevertheless, the story also identifies an Oklahoma district that plans to switch back to a five-day week, after school officials decided the approach wasn't working well for students or teachers. For a more detailed exploration of a four-day school week, check out this 2008 analysis from the Council on State Governments. Also, I came across a helpful research brief issued last year by the Center for Education Policy, Applied Research, and Evaluation at the University of Southern Maine. It notes that little research has been conducted on the impact of moving to a four-day school week on financial savings, student achievement, or other matters. \"As noted by many observers, the literature that exists on the four-day school\nweek is mainly positive, but not often peer-reviewed or scientifically based, and few summaries of this literature provide any critical analysis of the results,\" the report says. On the question of student achievement, the report says the shorter week does not appear to have a negative effect, but again cautions that much of the literature reviewed was not held to professional scrutiny. One of the most positive and ubiquitous findings from existing research, the report finds, is improved teacher and student attendance. Finally, the University of Southern Maine's analysis cautions that the actual financial savings from cutting a day out of the school week doesn't always live up to expectations, particularly if personnel costs are not reduced. The savings generally are seen in such areas as transportation, food services, and energy costs.\n\nDriven by hopes of cutting transportation, heating and staff costs, more and more school systems are moving to a four-day school week. Small, rural school districts have been in the vanguard of this trend, but larger urban districts are also making the shift. Right now at least twenty US states have one or more school districts operating on a four-day week, including California, Arizona and Michigan. Though shorter school weeks have been implemented from time to time in the US since the 1930s, and briefly became widespread during the “energy crisis” of the 1970s, definitive studies and reports on the impact of the shortened school week are few. This research brief is one of many that indicate that the change can often improve attendance and morale for both students and teachers. Some proponents even tout improved academic performance; especially where cost savings might forestall teacher layoffs or larger class sizes. (Most evaluations indicate that there is no net effect on achievement, though some reports have shown reduced test scores.) Opponents raise concerns about how long, tiring days in the classroom will affect young children, and point to the burdens placed on working parents to find costly daycare. What is the impact of the four-day week on tutors and tutoring? There may be some downsides the overall effect is likely to be positive. Most encouraging is the fact that some districts instituting a four-day week are explicitly inviting students who need extra help to come to school on their “off day” for tutoring sessions. In some cases, schools are reinvesting the money they’re saving to create tutoring opportunities, such as hiring one-on-one tutors for academic underachievers. Similarly, when the school system in Georgia’s Peach County moved to a four-day week, several community organizations (including Boys and Girls clubs and a church) began offering affordable tutoring on Mondays (their “off day”) for only $10 to $15. Will students have less time and energy after school for tutoring on the days when they attend classes? Some tutors may need to shift their schedules to connect with learners on their off day or on weekends – possibly making for some intensely busy days for tutors. But most schools are pushing dismissal ahead by no more than an hour, while reducing lunch and recess times. So after-school tutoring opportunities might not be adversely impacted. Tutors who connect with students online or “on demand” might benefit from an increase in business as learners move to fit tutoring into their new school-day schedules. For example, tutors who can support “digital learners” who want to learn anytime, anyplace, at their own pace, may take yet more business from traditional tutoring services due to the shorter school week. The “bottom line” for tutors is that shortening the school week can potentially create new opportunities: first by opening up a “tutoring day” on Monday or Friday, and second through increased demand for services in areas where schools are hiring tutors. As always, those who can adapt their offerings to the changing needs of students and their families will be positioned to make the most of the situation. Featured photo courtesy of Jean Valley.

A report from Indiana University’s CEEP says that there is no strong evidence that a four-day week has either a positive or negative effect on achievement. In Iowa, the state education department appears to concur with Ms. Christie’s assessment of the fiscal benefits of such a change. “The state has taken the stand that if a district is doing this just to save money, that’s not something they’re OK with. Historically, they haven’t approved those calendars,” said WACO Superintendent Darrell Smith. “And I’m OK with that. Education shouldn’t be about money.”\nLooking to Improve\nThough WACO wasn’t the first district in Iowa to make the request to the state for such a schedule change, it was the first to gain approval, largely because the district’s motivation has not been budget-based. “In fact, it could end up costing us money,” said Mr. Smith. The federal No Child Left Behind Act requires that districts make “adequate yearly progress” on state academic tests. But, Mr. Smith said, “when we looked at our data, it was flat.”\nSo the district decided a four-day week might offer an opportunity to improve learning through additional assistance and educational enrichment opportunities for students and professional development for teachers. For 13 Fridays throughout the school year, beginning this week, students in all grades will have the opportunity to attend a half-day, when all teachers will be on hand for office hours, during which students can get remedial tutoring or opportunities for credit recovery. For students seeking an additional challenge, the district’s schools will also offer enrichment classes, such as music, engineering, or exploration science classes, on those Fridays or will allow for concurrent enrollment through the local community college, giving students the opportunity to acquire college credits. All other Fridays will be used for professional development, allowing teachers time to meet with fellow department members and collaboratively plan their lessons, or learn how to bring technology into their classrooms. “What we’re looking at is the opportunity to change the way our teachers teach,” said Mr. Smith. “We’re really interested in using technology as an instructional tool, and in putting it in the hands of kids. But we have to get our teachers ready first.”\nAs of last week, 95 percent of WACO's students had expressed interest in coming into school for the Friday programs. Mr. Smith said the district may use the time to bone up on computerized textbooks to develop more flexible curricula and digital assessments that will give teachers better feedback on what their students are learning and what knowledge they’re still lacking. “We don’t want to waste time teaching students what they already know. We want to teach what they don’t know,” he said. The WACO district plans to follow the schedule for at least three years to fully weigh its effectiveness based on student results from state and district assessments and teacher feedback. “[This plan] puts everybody on the same wavelength,” Mr. Smith said. “It takes everybody working toward the same thing to make something work.”\nVol. 33, Issue 04, Page 10\nGet more stories and free e-newsletters! - Aspen High School Principal\n- Aspen School District, Aspen, CO\n- Director of Schools (Superintendent)\n- Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools, Nashville, TN\n- Scale Your Impact.

After all, as one person noted, we are no longer an agrarian society. Nope, we’re a society where there are lots of two-income households. So if the child is home one day a week, who stays home to watch him or her? This is already a scenario that takes place when a child is sick, if there is a school snow day, or other emergencies. For many households, this becomes a juggling act worthy of the finest circus. It’s fun to assume that “somebody else” will fill in the gap. But who? The Y? Some social service agency? Or, perhaps in some ironic twist, the schools? Of course, the solution that some families have been forced to use is create a society of unsupervised latchkey kids. Hey, it works so well for a couple hours a day, doesn’t it? What’s another few hours? Seriously, such a plan has its benefits in terms of energy savings. My concern, besides the longer school day with less attentiveness and kids who depend on school lunches five days a week, is how the school-home balance beam is navigated.\n\nThe purpose of this qualitative, case study was to understand how the four-day school week influenced a school district in Northern Arizona, over five years. Research Questions 1 through 3 addressed district performance including teacher\/staff and student attendance, achievement on the state assessment in reading and math, and costs on utilities. Research Question 4 addressed stakeholder perception. Maslow’s hierarchy of needs theory and collective impact theory served as the foundation for this study. The purposive sample included 40 internal and external stakeholders. Data collected included archival documents, semistructured interviews, and a structured questionnaire. A quantitative trend analysis was conducted on archival documents. Qualitative thematic analysis was conducted on interview perception data and structured questionnaire data was recoded for frequency. Archival data revealed natural gas costs decreased, student attendance improved, teacher\/staff attendance declined, math scores dropped, reading scores were flat, and water\/electricity costs increased. Perception data revealed stakeholders felt a positive impact on student attendance; saving money on utilities; teacher PD time; part-time employment; family time; and morale and staff retention. Stakeholders felt negatively towards teacher collaboration time; student achievement; the longer school day; lack of structure, supervision, and nutritious meals on the off day; and the Monday federal holidays causing school to be in session only three days per week. Overall, data revealed that while perceptions varied, stakeholders preferred the four-day regardless of any negative impacts to the district. The implications for this study are a resource and lessons learned for district personnel seeking to eliminate a day of instruction for the purposes of saving money. |Commitee:||Griffith, Nathan, McNulty, Charles|\n|School:||Grand Canyon University|\n|School Location:||United States -- Arizona|\n|Source:||DAI-A 79\/08(E), Dissertation Abstracts International|\n|Subjects:||Educational leadership, Educational administration|\n|Keywords:||District performance, Four-day school week, Stakeholder perception|\nCopyright in each Dissertation and Thesis is retained by the author.

This has led to the intensification of many campaigns around flexible working, among them a call for a four-day week. The four-day week has been used in the past as a way to reduce unemployment, for example, during the Great Depression of the 1930s, but the idea has been gaining more relevance in recent years and is becoming a global trend. Spain, for example, is working on a national shift to a four-day or 32-hour week, after a proposal by Vice President Pablo Iglesias in early December 2020. Unsurprisingly, not everyone is sold on the idea, many presuming that productivity would take a hit and that the transition would prove too costly. But several transnational companies have started to implement the four-day week with positive results. In 2019, Microsoft Japan ran a one-month trial to test the viability of a four-day working week and reported a significant increase in productivity, as well as a significant reduction in electricity costs and on the printing of paper pages. And Unilever is currently undertaking a 12-month trial among all of the business’s 81 staff in New Zealand. In the UK, a recent report by the thinktank Autonomy used profitability statistics on over 50,000 UK firms and found that under a worst-case scenario, a four-day week with no loss of pay would be affordable for most businesses once the initial phase of the COVID crisis has passed. The authors of the report argue that the UK government could prevent a steep rise in unemployment if companies were supported in moving to a four-day week, suggesting that the public sector should lead the way in adopting shorter working hours. Pre-empting government action, many UK businesses have already started experimenting. In 2019, Henley Business School ran a research project involving over 500 business leaders and 2,000 employees, including businesses that have already implemented a four-day working week (33% of businesses surveyed), looking into the benefits, challenges and alternatives to a four-day working week. The main benefits found were:\n- Improving the ability to attract and retain talent;\n- Increasing overall employee satisfaction;\n- Reporting lower employee sickness levels;\n- Increasing productivity. These benefits have a huge financial impact: the combined savings to UK business is already as high as £92 billion a year, 2% of total annual turnover. But some businesses are reluctant to move to a four-day week. For example, for those organisations that need to provide customer service beyond standard office hours, a reduction in employee availability would have a huge impact. Such operational difficulties were part of the reason the Wellcome Trust dropped plans to implement the four-day working week. Other employers believe that the four-day working week would be hard to put into practice because of trust issues. Half of the employees surveyed in our study would not opt for this way of working if they felt their employer didn’t support it properly. So how can businesses overcome these institutional hurdles to transitioning to a four-day week? 1. Start slow\nDespite the evidence of potential economic benefit, some businesses are reluctant to implement the four-day working week. Given this, a good option is to start slow. Unilever and Microsoft are examples of companies that have trialled this work arrangement in sub-sections of the company. Starting with a particular department or subsidiary for a limited time can be a good way to test the water and assess the preliminary results of this change. 2. Engage line managers\nHaving line managers on board is crucial to implement a four-day working week. If line managers view flexible work practices negatively, they are less likely to make their teams feel that a four-day working week is something that they should pursue without risking their career. Running training sessions where benefits are demonstrated is an option here, but the most important factor is engaging line managers in the decision-making process, so that all operational obstacles can be overcome before any implementation. 3. Engage staff\nOne of the key reasons that the four-day working week resonates with the vast majority of employees is that it may lead to increased work-life balance. But people are of course different and have varied motivations that need to be taken into account.\n\nThe concept of a four-day working week is gaining popularity across the United Kingdom, with an increasing number of businesses recognising its potential benefits. According to a recent YouGov report, 63 per cent of UK businesses believe that their staff would be either more productive (41 per cent) or equally productive (22 per cent) working a four-day week. Meanwhile, 71 per cent of participants in the UK 4-Day Week Pilot reported reduced levels of burnout at the end of the trial. The shift in work patterns, both here in the UK and internationally, has been spurred by the desire to create a better work-life balance for employees, while also reducing burnout, and increasing overall job satisfaction. The reality is that a relatively small change in how companies organise their work schedule can bring a series of advantages, for employers as well as employees:\n- Increased productivity: Contrary to conventional belief, reducing the work week to four days can boost productivity among staff. With a shorter work week, employees are motivated to make the most of their time, leading to improved focus and efficiency. - Enhanced work-life balance: The four-day working week allows employees to have an extra day for personal commitments, family time or pursuing hobbies. This results in a healthier work-life balance and, in turn, leads to increased job satisfaction and reduced stress levels. - Reduced absenteeism and burnout: By providing employees with an additional day off work each week, companies can significantly reduce burnout and absenteeism rates. Rested and rejuvenated employees are more likely to be engaged, motivated and committed to their work. - Attraction and retention of top talent: Offering a four-day working week can be a powerful recruitment and retention tool. In a competitive job market, companies that prioritise work-life balance and employee wellbeing have a better chance of attracting and retaining top talent, especially when looking to the Gen-Z-fication of the job market. Of course, it is worth keeping in mind that, as with all big innovations, not all that glitters is gold, and it’s not as simple as switching off your computer on a Thursday evening and walking away. Implementing a four-day working week requires careful planning and adjustment and managers and employees need to adapt to new schedules, ensuring that workloads are managed effectively and deadlines are met. Moreover, depending on the nature of the business, a reduced working week could potentially have an impact on customer service, if not managed correctly. It is imperative that companies carefully consider how to maintain service levels while accommodating new work practices and schedules. When it comes to reducing hours in the office, training is often the first casualty and the shift towards a four-day working week can have significant implications for corporate training and learning and development initiatives. Some might argue that reduced working hours offer less time for learning and may create a new working class where upskilling will become impossible. This needn’t be the case though, and instead of creating learning roadblocks, the shorter working week may be the best thing to happen in L&D. Traditionally, companies of all types and sizes have invested significant time and resources in lengthy training programmes that may not always align with employees' actual needs or job requirements. The reality is that the length of time a training programme takes is not necessarily indicative of its worth or its success, and with shorter work weeks, companies need to prioritise and tailor training programmes to address specific skill gaps and provide more targeted learning experiences. The micro-learning approach to L&D, for instance, benefits both companies and employees, allowing businesses to allocate resources more effectively, investing in training programmes that yield tangible results. On the other side of the scale, employees can reap the rewards too, focusing on acquiring skills and knowledge that directly contribute to their professional growth and job performance, rather than just participating in a series of box-ticking exercises. This shift towards targeted learning ensures that training efforts are more efficient, impactful and relevant. Employees are more likely to be engaged in such training and this has obvious benefits for the company too. With the introduction of a four-day working week becoming more and more common in businesses across the UK, companies are being forced to revisit and revise their procedures to accommodate the intensified engagement during the shortened workweek. In many cases, this is leading to a more streamlined and efficient work environment, as employees become motivated to make the most of their limited work hours.\n\nEven the wariest of employees hold views on the topic, so it is important for line managers and employees to have a frank discussion about how best to improve wellbeing and productivity. 4. Assess processes and results\nIf an organisation has taken the plunge and started implementing the four-day week, it is extremely important to monitor its implementation: is the shift working? And if not, why not? Based on this analysis, organisations can then decide whether to expand the scheme to their entire workforce. 5. Think about other options\nThe four-day working week may not work for every organisation, and those that are heavily reliant on customer service tend to tread carefully. But there are other types of flexible working practices. Other forms of flexibility may be more suitable for some organisations, at least in the short term. These include remote work, working part-time (at reduced pay) or a mix between remote and office work. Undoubtedly, we are moving into a future of more flexible working practices, a future that has been catalysed by the pandemic. The four-day working week has the potential of reducing unemployment, raising productivity and improving life and work satisfaction. But organisations may need to reflect carefully on which forms of flexibility may release the greatest wellbeing and productivity benefits for them and their employees.

During this legislative session, Sen. Randi Becker R-Eatonville, proposed a bill that would allow 20 school districts of up to 2,200 students to use the four-day school week. Here, Don Kordosky, superintendent of Oregon's Oakridge School District, shares his personal experience and insights on making the switch. When considering the switch from a five-day school week to a four-day school week, one need only recall that classic saying: “Less is more.”\nAs superintendent of Oakridge School District in Oregon, I learned this through personal experience when my schools made the switch. Initially, I was against the idea. How could a four-day week possibly be in the best interest of students? But after doing the research and seeing the benefits firsthand, I became a complete supporter. The positives of the four-day week far outweigh the negatives, and the negatives can all be alleviated through well-thought-out strategies. The parents of our students, the staff, the school board, and the entire community of Oakridge reviewed the four-day week for an entire year prior to implementation. Since implementation I have become a four-day week advocate because of all the positive attributes including: better student academic performance, increased teacher vitality, increased student engagement, decreased student discipline problems, and an improvement to the overall culture of excellence for the district. Most school districts originally begin a review of the four-day school week as a strategy to address financial shortfalls. (Mine did not.) By trimming one day off the week, a school can save in bus services, cafeteria, and facilities costs. This can be especially crucial during state budget shortfalls, where K-12 funding can be in danger of cuts, and even more so for rural school districts, which must run their schools on a minimal budget. But not all school districts go to a four-day week because of money, and certainly it is not the only way a school can benefit from the change. The four-day week is not for all districts, and there are negative attributes that need to have alleviation strategies in place prior to implementation. Negative attributes include parent fears of not being able to find child care on Fridays, fatigue for students that have to attend school for longer days, and decreases in compensation for employees who lose hours. An example of an alleviation strategy for the child care concern is the offering of Red Cross Childcare First Aid certification classes for high school students. These students then became available for parents who could not find relatives or other child care on Fridays. Another strategy is offering extra duty employment for bus drivers, cooks, and custodians, who all lose significant hours. In our district we made it a practice to offer all paid athletic supervision and activity duties to the employees who lost work time prior to other employees. Regardless of the negative consequence associated with the four-day week, there are strategies to alleviate the negative impact on students, families and staff. Of note, many parents have found that eliminating the large number of half-days for students that plague five-day weeks — such as teacher work days, curriculum days, grading days, inservice days, etc. — has made finding childcare easier. With the four-day week, teachers can do their non-teaching activities on the day off, and therefore schools do not have to send children home at awkward and inconsistent times. However, what I have found is that most common four-day school week objections are derived more from a fear of change (and a indeed a reasonable concern) rather than empirical study. When scrutinized, these objections are both addressed and debunked by the switch. To demonstrate that point, here are four reasons why the four-day school week is an improvement to the five-day week. Teacher and student attendance increases. Teachers are the key to student learning, and having the regular classroom teacher in the room instead of a substitute teacher is better for kids. Because teachers are able to schedule meetings, doctor’s appointments and other possible conflicts with their teaching schedule on the extra day off, teachers are better able to provide a consistency for students. In Oakridge, the number of available work hours missed by teachers decreased significantly (21.8%) after the move to a four-day school week. Student attendance typically increases, too.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e211e027-e45b-4d40-9de0-8293e4a42775>"]},{"passage":"Most districts that implement a four-day week see substantial improvement in attendance at the high school level per available instructional hours (they spend more time learning, but less days at school). Attendance in some schools increased 3% as measured against available instructional hours. Contrary to fears, instructional time for students can increase from what it was before if it is the wish of the school district. By subtracting non-teaching activities from Fridays (lunch time, passing periods, transportation time, recess) and adding those paid teacher work hours to instructional hours Monday-Thursday, the amount of paid teacher time that is allocated to instruction increases. Each school day is comprised of many activities that have no direct positive correlation to student academic achievement. The time we pay teachers when they are not teaching includes before school starts (usually about 30 minutes), the time that society pays teachers after school (usually 45 minutes), passing periods (typically six passing periods of five minutes each equals 30 minutes). All of this “non-instructional time” on Fridays is eliminated and that time can be changed to instructional time on the other remaining four days. Also, the flexibility of the four-day week allows it to work around national holidays, so even if a Monday needs to be taken off — say, for Labor Day — students can still go to school for four days (Monday-Friday). The four-day school week offers four days of instruction every week, not the inconsistency of the five-day week which often has only three, three and one-half, or four days of student instruction. This is one of the keys to the four-day week: Instead of sending kids home so that teachers can do non-instructional duties you bring teachers in on Fridays to complete non-instructional tasks! On the four-day week, student discipline decreases and student engagement increases. The commonly assumed reason for the decrease in student discipline is that students are more actively engaged in more strenuous and rigorous classes than on a five-day week. Keep in mind that student seat time typically increases in the move from a five-day week to a four-day week, so claims that student discipline incidents decrease because they are in school for less time is not a viable argument. Also, teachers commonly reflect upon the change from a five-day to a four-day week that students work harder, are engaged more, and learn more. Teachers have noted that there is increased intrinsic motivation to cover material in fewer days with more instructional time, and that students adjust to increased expectations by becoming more engaged. Moreover, the extra instructional time allows teachers to better teach more complicated subjects, which can otherwise be a problem especially in math and sciences. Perhaps most importantly, teacher vitality and morale increases tremendously. Teaching is an extremely difficult job, where it is common for teachers to spend long nights and weekends assessing student work and preparing. Any teacher worth their salt does not work only “to the contract” work hours, but does everything they can in their non-working hours to provide as many learning opportunities for their students as possible. On a five-day week it is not uncommon to see teachers work late on Friday nights grading and assessing the week’s student work. Saturdays are often spent working on preparation for the next week’s worth of lessons, leaving Sundays to reinvigorate and spend time with their families. As a result, teachers often start the school year each September bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, ready to face new challenges. But by February, many become exhausted. The four-day week, even though each instructional day is longer, provides three days for teachers to complete needed work and spend some much-needed time with their families. This simple fact increases teacher morale, decreases teacher turnover, and improves teacher vitality. This leads to happier and more energetic teachers, which results in better education for students. Don't let nostalgia for an antiquated tradition cloud your mind — take a few minutes and read about the four-day week and get the facts. Plan for the negative attributes, maximize the positive attributes, and make sure that the community is thoroughly involved in the implementation process. The best way to ensure the failure of the implementation of the four-day week is to “do it to the community, instead of “doing it with the community.”","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e211e027-e45b-4d40-9de0-8293e4a42775>"]},{"passage":"Four-Day School Week Is on the Rise, Story Says\nThe idea of a four-day school week is nothing new. It's long been embraced by some small, rural school districts. But a new Associated Press story suggests the practice is spreading amid budget pressures on school systems. Featured is a 4,000-student rural district in Peach County, Ga., where school officials reportedly shifted last year to a four-day schedule to help fill a $1 million budget shortfall. What's intriguing is that both student attendance and standardized test scores have since improved. (Apparently, each school day is longer to make up for lost time.) Across the country, more than 120 districts operate on a four-day week, the AP story says. (If only employers of education journalists would embrace this idea!) Also, over the past couple of years, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Maine have changed state law so that districts can count their academic year by hour rather than days, so that a four-day week is possible, the story says. Nevertheless, the story also identifies an Oklahoma district that plans to switch back to a five-day week, after school officials decided the approach wasn't working well for students or teachers. For a more detailed exploration of a four-day school week, check out this 2008 analysis from the Council on State Governments. Also, I came across a helpful research brief issued last year by the Center for Education Policy, Applied Research, and Evaluation at the University of Southern Maine. It notes that little research has been conducted on the impact of moving to a four-day school week on financial savings, student achievement, or other matters. \"As noted by many observers, the literature that exists on the four-day school\nweek is mainly positive, but not often peer-reviewed or scientifically based, and few summaries of this literature provide any critical analysis of the results,\" the report says. On the question of student achievement, the report says the shorter week does not appear to have a negative effect, but again cautions that much of the literature reviewed was not held to professional scrutiny. One of the most positive and ubiquitous findings from existing research, the report finds, is improved teacher and student attendance. Finally, the University of Southern Maine's analysis cautions that the actual financial savings from cutting a day out of the school week doesn't always live up to expectations, particularly if personnel costs are not reduced. The savings generally are seen in such areas as transportation, food services, and energy costs.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:39e4263e-6eb5-4a7f-90a9-a501eac204e9>"]},{"passage":"Driven by hopes of cutting transportation, heating and staff costs, more and more school systems are moving to a four-day school week. Small, rural school districts have been in the vanguard of this trend, but larger urban districts are also making the shift. Right now at least twenty US states have one or more school districts operating on a four-day week, including California, Arizona and Michigan. Though shorter school weeks have been implemented from time to time in the US since the 1930s, and briefly became widespread during the “energy crisis” of the 1970s, definitive studies and reports on the impact of the shortened school week are few. This research brief is one of many that indicate that the change can often improve attendance and morale for both students and teachers. Some proponents even tout improved academic performance; especially where cost savings might forestall teacher layoffs or larger class sizes. (Most evaluations indicate that there is no net effect on achievement, though some reports have shown reduced test scores.) Opponents raise concerns about how long, tiring days in the classroom will affect young children, and point to the burdens placed on working parents to find costly daycare. What is the impact of the four-day week on tutors and tutoring? There may be some downsides the overall effect is likely to be positive. Most encouraging is the fact that some districts instituting a four-day week are explicitly inviting students who need extra help to come to school on their “off day” for tutoring sessions. In some cases, schools are reinvesting the money they’re saving to create tutoring opportunities, such as hiring one-on-one tutors for academic underachievers. Similarly, when the school system in Georgia’s Peach County moved to a four-day week, several community organizations (including Boys and Girls clubs and a church) began offering affordable tutoring on Mondays (their “off day”) for only $10 to $15. Will students have less time and energy after school for tutoring on the days when they attend classes? Some tutors may need to shift their schedules to connect with learners on their off day or on weekends – possibly making for some intensely busy days for tutors. But most schools are pushing dismissal ahead by no more than an hour, while reducing lunch and recess times. So after-school tutoring opportunities might not be adversely impacted. Tutors who connect with students online or “on demand” might benefit from an increase in business as learners move to fit tutoring into their new school-day schedules. For example, tutors who can support “digital learners” who want to learn anytime, anyplace, at their own pace, may take yet more business from traditional tutoring services due to the shorter school week. The “bottom line” for tutors is that shortening the school week can potentially create new opportunities: first by opening up a “tutoring day” on Monday or Friday, and second through increased demand for services in areas where schools are hiring tutors. As always, those who can adapt their offerings to the changing needs of students and their families will be positioned to make the most of the situation. Featured photo courtesy of Jean Valley.

A report from Indiana University’s CEEP says that there is no strong evidence that a four-day week has either a positive or negative effect on achievement. In Iowa, the state education department appears to concur with Ms. Christie’s assessment of the fiscal benefits of such a change. “The state has taken the stand that if a district is doing this just to save money, that’s not something they’re OK with. Historically, they haven’t approved those calendars,” said WACO Superintendent Darrell Smith. “And I’m OK with that. Education shouldn’t be about money.”\nLooking to Improve\nThough WACO wasn’t the first district in Iowa to make the request to the state for such a schedule change, it was the first to gain approval, largely because the district’s motivation has not been budget-based. “In fact, it could end up costing us money,” said Mr. Smith. The federal No Child Left Behind Act requires that districts make “adequate yearly progress” on state academic tests. But, Mr. Smith said, “when we looked at our data, it was flat.”\nSo the district decided a four-day week might offer an opportunity to improve learning through additional assistance and educational enrichment opportunities for students and professional development for teachers. For 13 Fridays throughout the school year, beginning this week, students in all grades will have the opportunity to attend a half-day, when all teachers will be on hand for office hours, during which students can get remedial tutoring or opportunities for credit recovery. For students seeking an additional challenge, the district’s schools will also offer enrichment classes, such as music, engineering, or exploration science classes, on those Fridays or will allow for concurrent enrollment through the local community college, giving students the opportunity to acquire college credits. All other Fridays will be used for professional development, allowing teachers time to meet with fellow department members and collaboratively plan their lessons, or learn how to bring technology into their classrooms. “What we’re looking at is the opportunity to change the way our teachers teach,” said Mr. Smith. “We’re really interested in using technology as an instructional tool, and in putting it in the hands of kids. But we have to get our teachers ready first.”\nAs of last week, 95 percent of WACO's students had expressed interest in coming into school for the Friday programs. Mr. Smith said the district may use the time to bone up on computerized textbooks to develop more flexible curricula and digital assessments that will give teachers better feedback on what their students are learning and what knowledge they’re still lacking. “We don’t want to waste time teaching students what they already know. We want to teach what they don’t know,” he said. The WACO district plans to follow the schedule for at least three years to fully weigh its effectiveness based on student results from state and district assessments and teacher feedback. “[This plan] puts everybody on the same wavelength,” Mr. Smith said. “It takes everybody working toward the same thing to make something work.”\nVol. 33, Issue 04, Page 10\nGet more stories and free e-newsletters! - Aspen High School Principal\n- Aspen School District, Aspen, CO\n- Director of Schools (Superintendent)\n- Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools, Nashville, TN\n- Scale Your Impact.

After all, as one person noted, we are no longer an agrarian society. Nope, we’re a society where there are lots of two-income households. So if the child is home one day a week, who stays home to watch him or her? This is already a scenario that takes place when a child is sick, if there is a school snow day, or other emergencies. For many households, this becomes a juggling act worthy of the finest circus. It’s fun to assume that “somebody else” will fill in the gap. But who? The Y? Some social service agency? Or, perhaps in some ironic twist, the schools? Of course, the solution that some families have been forced to use is create a society of unsupervised latchkey kids. Hey, it works so well for a couple hours a day, doesn’t it? What’s another few hours? Seriously, such a plan has its benefits in terms of energy savings.

Research Questions 1 through 3 addressed district performance including teacher\/staff and student attendance, achievement on the state assessment in reading and math, and costs on utilities. Research Question 4 addressed stakeholder perception. Maslow’s hierarchy of needs theory and collective impact theory served as the foundation for this study. The purposive sample included 40 internal and external stakeholders. Data collected included archival documents, semistructured interviews, and a structured questionnaire. A quantitative trend analysis was conducted on archival documents. Qualitative thematic analysis was conducted on interview perception data and structured questionnaire data was recoded for frequency. Archival data revealed natural gas costs decreased, student attendance improved, teacher\/staff attendance declined, math scores dropped, reading scores were flat, and water\/electricity costs increased. Perception data revealed stakeholders felt a positive impact on student attendance; saving money on utilities; teacher PD time; part-time employment; family time; and morale and staff retention. Stakeholders felt negatively towards teacher collaboration time; student achievement; the longer school day; lack of structure, supervision, and nutritious meals on the off day; and the Monday federal holidays causing school to be in session only three days per week. Overall, data revealed that while perceptions varied, stakeholders preferred the four-day regardless of any negative impacts to the district. The implications for this study are a resource and lessons learned for district personnel seeking to eliminate a day of instruction for the purposes of saving money. |Commitee:||Griffith, Nathan, McNulty, Charles|\n|School:||Grand Canyon University|\n|School Location:||United States -- Arizona|\n|Source:||DAI-A 79\/08(E), Dissertation Abstracts International|\n|Subjects:||Educational leadership, Educational administration|\n|Keywords:||District performance, Four-day school week, Stakeholder perception|\nCopyright in each Dissertation and Thesis is retained by the author.

This has led to the intensification of many campaigns around flexible working, among them a call for a four-day week. The four-day week has been used in the past as a way to reduce unemployment, for example, during the Great Depression of the 1930s, but the idea has been gaining more relevance in recent years and is becoming a global trend. Spain, for example, is working on a national shift to a four-day or 32-hour week, after a proposal by Vice President Pablo Iglesias in early December 2020. Unsurprisingly, not everyone is sold on the idea, many presuming that productivity would take a hit and that the transition would prove too costly. But several transnational companies have started to implement the four-day week with positive results. In 2019, Microsoft Japan ran a one-month trial to test the viability of a four-day working week and reported a significant increase in productivity, as well as a significant reduction in electricity costs and on the printing of paper pages. And Unilever is currently undertaking a 12-month trial among all of the business’s 81 staff in New Zealand. In the UK, a recent report by the thinktank Autonomy used profitability statistics on over 50,000 UK firms and found that under a worst-case scenario, a four-day week with no loss of pay would be affordable for most businesses once the initial phase of the COVID crisis has passed. The authors of the report argue that the UK government could prevent a steep rise in unemployment if companies were supported in moving to a four-day week, suggesting that the public sector should lead the way in adopting shorter working hours. Pre-empting government action, many UK businesses have already started experimenting. In 2019, Henley Business School ran a research project involving over 500 business leaders and 2,000 employees, including businesses that have already implemented a four-day working week (33% of businesses surveyed), looking into the benefits, challenges and alternatives to a four-day working week. The main benefits found were:\n- Improving the ability to attract and retain talent;\n- Increasing overall employee satisfaction;\n- Reporting lower employee sickness levels;\n- Increasing productivity. These benefits have a huge financial impact: the combined savings to UK business is already as high as £92 billion a year, 2% of total annual turnover. But some businesses are reluctant to move to a four-day week. For example, for those organisations that need to provide customer service beyond standard office hours, a reduction in employee availability would have a huge impact. Such operational difficulties were part of the reason the Wellcome Trust dropped plans to implement the four-day working week. Other employers believe that the four-day working week would be hard to put into practice because of trust issues. Half of the employees surveyed in our study would not opt for this way of working if they felt their employer didn’t support it properly. So how can businesses overcome these institutional hurdles to transitioning to a four-day week? 1. Start slow\nDespite the evidence of potential economic benefit, some businesses are reluctant to implement the four-day working week. Given this, a good option is to start slow. Unilever and Microsoft are examples of companies that have trialled this work arrangement in sub-sections of the company. Starting with a particular department or subsidiary for a limited time can be a good way to test the water and assess the preliminary results of this change. 2. Engage line managers\nHaving line managers on board is crucial to implement a four-day working week. If line managers view flexible work practices negatively, they are less likely to make their teams feel that a four-day working week is something that they should pursue without risking their career. Running training sessions where benefits are demonstrated is an option here, but the most important factor is engaging line managers in the decision-making process, so that all operational obstacles can be overcome before any implementation. 3. Engage staff\nOne of the key reasons that the four-day working week resonates with the vast majority of employees is that it may lead to increased work-life balance. But people are of course different and have varied motivations that need to be taken into account.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:f25836bb-77d4-42ea-a397-1cc66a7604b9>"]},{"passage":"The concept of a four-day working week is gaining popularity across the United Kingdom, with an increasing number of businesses recognising its potential benefits. According to a recent YouGov report, 63 per cent of UK businesses believe that their staff would be either more productive (41 per cent) or equally productive (22 per cent) working a four-day week. Meanwhile, 71 per cent of participants in the UK 4-Day Week Pilot reported reduced levels of burnout at the end of the trial. The shift in work patterns, both here in the UK and internationally, has been spurred by the desire to create a better work-life balance for employees, while also reducing burnout, and increasing overall job satisfaction. The reality is that a relatively small change in how companies organise their work schedule can bring a series of advantages, for employers as well as employees:\n- Increased productivity: Contrary to conventional belief, reducing the work week to four days can boost productivity among staff. With a shorter work week, employees are motivated to make the most of their time, leading to improved focus and efficiency. - Enhanced work-life balance: The four-day working week allows employees to have an extra day for personal commitments, family time or pursuing hobbies. This results in a healthier work-life balance and, in turn, leads to increased job satisfaction and reduced stress levels. - Reduced absenteeism and burnout: By providing employees with an additional day off work each week, companies can significantly reduce burnout and absenteeism rates. Rested and rejuvenated employees are more likely to be engaged, motivated and committed to their work. - Attraction and retention of top talent: Offering a four-day working week can be a powerful recruitment and retention tool. In a competitive job market, companies that prioritise work-life balance and employee wellbeing have a better chance of attracting and retaining top talent, especially when looking to the Gen-Z-fication of the job market. Of course, it is worth keeping in mind that, as with all big innovations, not all that glitters is gold, and it’s not as simple as switching off your computer on a Thursday evening and walking away. Implementing a four-day working week requires careful planning and adjustment and managers and employees need to adapt to new schedules, ensuring that workloads are managed effectively and deadlines are met. Moreover, depending on the nature of the business, a reduced working week could potentially have an impact on customer service, if not managed correctly. It is imperative that companies carefully consider how to maintain service levels while accommodating new work practices and schedules. When it comes to reducing hours in the office, training is often the first casualty and the shift towards a four-day working week can have significant implications for corporate training and learning and development initiatives. Some might argue that reduced working hours offer less time for learning and may create a new working class where upskilling will become impossible. This needn’t be the case though, and instead of creating learning roadblocks, the shorter working week may be the best thing to happen in L&D. Traditionally, companies of all types and sizes have invested significant time and resources in lengthy training programmes that may not always align with employees' actual needs or job requirements. The reality is that the length of time a training programme takes is not necessarily indicative of its worth or its success, and with shorter work weeks, companies need to prioritise and tailor training programmes to address specific skill gaps and provide more targeted learning experiences. The micro-learning approach to L&D, for instance, benefits both companies and employees, allowing businesses to allocate resources more effectively, investing in training programmes that yield tangible results. On the other side of the scale, employees can reap the rewards too, focusing on acquiring skills and knowledge that directly contribute to their professional growth and job performance, rather than just participating in a series of box-ticking exercises. This shift towards targeted learning ensures that training efforts are more efficient, impactful and relevant. Employees are more likely to be engaged in such training and this has obvious benefits for the company too. With the introduction of a four-day working week becoming more and more common in businesses across the UK, companies are being forced to revisit and revise their procedures to accommodate the intensified engagement during the shortened workweek. In many cases, this is leading to a more streamlined and efficient work environment, as employees become motivated to make the most of their limited work hours.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:0d97a410-12b9-437f-a836-0e5813899726>"]},{"passage":"Even the wariest of employees hold views on the topic, so it is important for line managers and employees to have a frank discussion about how best to improve wellbeing and productivity. 4. Assess processes and results\nIf an organisation has taken the plunge and started implementing the four-day week, it is extremely important to monitor its implementation: is the shift working? And if not, why not? Based on this analysis, organisations can then decide whether to expand the scheme to their entire workforce. 5. Think about other options\nThe four-day working week may not work for every organisation, and those that are heavily reliant on customer service tend to tread carefully. But there are other types of flexible working practices. Other forms of flexibility may be more suitable for some organisations, at least in the short term. These include remote work, working part-time (at reduced pay) or a mix between remote and office work. Undoubtedly, we are moving into a future of more flexible working practices, a future that has been catalysed by the pandemic. The four-day working week has the potential of reducing unemployment, raising productivity and improving life and work satisfaction. But organisations may need to reflect carefully on which forms of flexibility may release the greatest wellbeing and productivity benefits for them and their employees.

Keeping track of all of them can be a real pain, especially if you have to log in and out of each one every time you want to use it. Fortunately, there's a solution to this problem: API integrations. API integrations allow you to connect two or more applications so that they can share data and information with each other. This means that you can access all of your applications from one central location, and you don't have to remember multiple login credentials. There are a few things to keep in mind when setting up API integrations:\nMake sure that the applications you're connecting support API integration. Not all applications do, so it's important to check before you get started. You can usually tell if this is the case if they have an \"API\" link at the bottom of their homepage. Determine what kind of data you want to share between the applications. Some integrations only allow for basic data sharing, while others allow for more complex interaction. Determine how the applications will share data. Will data be automatically synced between the applications, or will you need to manually transfer data? Set up a secure connection between the applications. This is important to prevent unauthorized access to your data. Once you've considered these factors, you're ready to start setting up API integrations. There are a few different ways to do this, so we'll outline a few of the most popular methods. One of the most popular methods for setting up API integrations is using a service like Zapier or IFTTT. These services allow you to connect a wide variety of applications and services, and they make it easy to automate tasks between them. For example, you could use Zapier to automatically add new contacts from your CRM to your email marketing list. Another popular method for setting up API integrations is through custom development. This is typically more complex than using a service like Zapier or IFTTT, but it gives you more control over the integration. If you're not a developer, you can hire someone to develop the integration for you. Once you've set up your API integration, it's important to test it to make sure everything is working as expected. You don't want to wait until you need to use the integration to find out that there are problems. API integrations can simplify your life by allowing you to connect all of your favorite applications and services in one place.

But the settings are fairly similar in most other plugins too. Login to your WordPress dashboard, click on the Plugins tab, select \"Add New\" and search for Postman SMTP. When you find it, click install, and then activate. Step 2 - Find your SMTP settings\nYour SMTP settings depend on the email service you use. You will always need your email address (username) and your email password. You also need to know your mailserver name. In most cases the default port numbers work without modification, but take note of the port numbers your service provider specifies just in case there are issues. A quick Google search will uncover the settings for most major providers. If your email address is connected to your domain name, eg. email@example.com, then you can usually find your SMTP settings in your hosting control panel. *Pro Tip* For self hosted email mailboxes, adding \"mail.\" before the domain name usually gives you your mailserver name, eg. mail.mydomain.com, and the default port numbers (25 or 465) usually apply too. Step 3 - Configure Postman SMTP\nConfiguring the plugin is easy once you have all your information on hand. Once the plugin is activated, a new item will appear at the bottom of the Settings menu. Click on the 'Postman SMTP' menu to see the current status, a count of how many emails have been delivered, and a link to the email log. If you are using Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail or any of the other main email providers, it's often easiest to use the Setup Wizard option, and enter your details on each step. This process is self-explanatory and the system takes you through it step by step. If it won't work for you, follow the instructions below to manually setup your details. If you use a self-hosted email mailbox, or an SMTP service like SendInBlue to send messages, the \"Show All Settings\" option allows you to manually enter your information. - Choose \"SMTP\" in the dropdown menu, and then enter your mailserver name, port number and from-address details. - Next, select your Authentication method in the bottom dropdown and enter your email username and password. - You'll also need to fill out your name, envelope from-address and reply-to address details on the Message tab, BEFORE you click \"Save Changes\". - Usually the default settings on the Logging and Advanced tabs do not need to be modified. - Finally, on the plugin home screen click the \"Send a Test Email\" link to verify that your settings are correct and your emails are working. - Check your inbox, and smile. Setup is complete! Bonus step - integrate with SendGrid\nSMTP is instantly better than WordPress\/PHP mail. But it has its limitations. Every email provider has caps on the number of emails you can send per hour and per day. This means you most likely cannot send batch emails. Your limits will depend on your email provider. Here's a great compilation of email hosts and their limits. For maximum deliverability without limits, integrate with SendGrid or a similar SMTP service. Personally I use SendInBlue. Their entire systems are built with email delivery in mind, and optimized to ensure that your messages reach their destination every time. Our next tutorial will give a step-by-step setup guide to connect your WordPress emails to the SendGrid transactional email service.\n\nIn this article we will guide you though how to enable and setup your Zapier integration\nSetting Up Zapier\nWe recommend Zapier as our preferred provider for connecting your Disciple app to other systems.

To do this simply let your Customer Success Manager know that you're intending to use the Zapier integration and they'll switch it on for you. Once confirmed, navigate to the Integrations tab on the Console, generate an API Key, and add it to Zapier. Navigate to \"My Apps\" In Zapier, then select an \"add a connection\". From here search for Disciple and you will see the following screen. Take the API key you retrieved from the console and away you go, it really is that easy.

But the settings are fairly similar in most other plugins too. Login to your WordPress dashboard, click on the Plugins tab, select \"Add New\" and search for Postman SMTP. When you find it, click install, and then activate. Step 2 - Find your SMTP settings\nYour SMTP settings depend on the email service you use. You will always need your email address (username) and your email password. You also need to know your mailserver name. In most cases the default port numbers work without modification, but take note of the port numbers your service provider specifies just in case there are issues. A quick Google search will uncover the settings for most major providers. If your email address is connected to your domain name, eg. email@example.com, then you can usually find your SMTP settings in your hosting control panel. *Pro Tip* For self hosted email mailboxes, adding \"mail.\" before the domain name usually gives you your mailserver name, eg. mail.mydomain.com, and the default port numbers (25 or 465) usually apply too. Step 3 - Configure Postman SMTP\nConfiguring the plugin is easy once you have all your information on hand. Once the plugin is activated, a new item will appear at the bottom of the Settings menu. Click on the 'Postman SMTP' menu to see the current status, a count of how many emails have been delivered, and a link to the email log. If you are using Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail or any of the other main email providers, it's often easiest to use the Setup Wizard option, and enter your details on each step. This process is self-explanatory and the system takes you through it step by step. If it won't work for you, follow the instructions below to manually setup your details. If you use a self-hosted email mailbox, or an SMTP service like SendInBlue to send messages, the \"Show All Settings\" option allows you to manually enter your information. - Choose \"SMTP\" in the dropdown menu, and then enter your mailserver name, port number and from-address details. - Next, select your Authentication method in the bottom dropdown and enter your email username and password. - You'll also need to fill out your name, envelope from-address and reply-to address details on the Message tab, BEFORE you click \"Save Changes\". - Usually the default settings on the Logging and Advanced tabs do not need to be modified. - Finally, on the plugin home screen click the \"Send a Test Email\" link to verify that your settings are correct and your emails are working. - Check your inbox, and smile. Setup is complete! Bonus step - integrate with SendGrid\nSMTP is instantly better than WordPress\/PHP mail. But it has its limitations. Every email provider has caps on the number of emails you can send per hour and per day. This means you most likely cannot send batch emails. Your limits will depend on your email provider. Here's a great compilation of email hosts and their limits. For maximum deliverability without limits, integrate with SendGrid or a similar SMTP service. Personally I use SendInBlue. Their entire systems are built with email delivery in mind, and optimized to ensure that your messages reach their destination every time. Our next tutorial will give a step-by-step setup guide to connect your WordPress emails to the SendGrid transactional email service.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e52c4223-7a36-4df7-b617-b9fe07659b4c>"]},{"passage":"In this article we will guide you though how to enable and setup your Zapier integration\nSetting Up Zapier\nWe recommend Zapier as our preferred provider for connecting your Disciple app to other systems.

Getting out with your dog and enjoying the warm weather is the ultimate reward after being trapped inside all winter with a bored dog. From lake visits and dog friendly patios to hiking the Metroparks, if you have an active dog, you (and your dog) have no excuse to be bored during the summer months.\nIn addition to all of the outdoor activities you can do with your dog, local rescue groups host a number of fun dog friendly events throughout the summer. Here are the Top 5 Dog Friendly Events this summer you don’t want to miss:\nBring your dog along to watch you sip on some wine and tour the vineyards of Grand River Cellars in Madison. Held on June 13, Woof, Wag and Wine includes a tour of the winery, live music and auctions. Admission is $20 a person (which includes a Muddy Paws wine sampling) and proceeds go to the Lake Humane Society.\nAlthough the Indians aren’t doing their Puppypalooza event this year, you still have some opportunities to take your dog to a baseball game. Both the Lake Erie Captains and the Akron Rubber Ducks hold dog friendly nights. The Lake Erie Captains will hold their Bark at the Park on July 28, August 11 and August 23, and the Akron Rubber Ducks’ dog friendly games will be June 10 and August 19. A portion of the proceeds from each game will benefit local rescue groups.\nThe largest dog friendly event in Ohio, Canine Fun Days, is held every August at the Metroparks Polo Fields in Moreland Hills. This two day party for dogs and their people is organized by Greyhound Adoption of Ohio and includes swimming, dock diving, contests and more. This year’s event will be held August 16 and 17th.\nEvery Tuesday throughout the summer Tremont Taphouse hosts a dog friendly Yappy Hour to benefit local rescue groups. Bring your dog along for some patio time while you enjoy the Taphouse’s large selection of beer and delicious food. Adoptable dogs will also make appearances, so bring your dog-less friends along to meet their new best friend! Several other bars and wineries host Yappy Hours throughout the summer as well; check out my dog friendly events calendar for other upcoming dates.\nThis annual event, Dog Paddle and Pet-a-Palooza, is held at the Hinckley Reservation to benefit the Cleveland APL and the Medina County SPCA. Bring your dog to enjoy a swim at Ledge Pool as well as a mini dog fair including vendors and exhibitors. Also, dogs are allowed on rowboats at Hinckley Reservation, so if your dog doesn’t enjoy swimming you can rent a rowboat and take him for a boat ride instead.\nAnn McDonald is the writer behind the website Dogs in the CLE, the source for what to do with your dog in Cleveland. A lifelong dog lover, it took her until the age of 14 to finally convince her parents to get a dog (a crazy beagle named Daisy) and it’s been a love affair ever since.

Except Cleveland is a city with its own swagger, and a cost of living so low that Stockham said, \"You can buy a house for less than a car, and you should never pay full retail price for anything here.\" Also: Cleveland is the place for a hipster hotdog hangout that puts Froot Loops on its dogs, a brewery that has residents lining up for Christmas-spiced beer, and one of the world's best symphony orchestras. Come hungry, and let Stockham be your guide. Where should we stay? If you stay downtown, you can't go wrong. My favorite is Wallace Manor Bed and Breakfast in Ohio City; it’s a beautiful old, Victorian-era building that was recently renovated. The owners are super friendly and take care of people really well. We also have a Westin downtown that’s attached to Urban Farmer, a steakhouse that sources what it can locally. Other hotels to consider: the Metropolitan at the Nine, a luxury hotel-condo-restaurant complex, which is new, and a big deal for Cleveland; the new Hilton; and the Drury Hotel, because it’s in a converted school district administration building and is all marble. Where should we grab breakfast? Urban Farmer has a great brunch. But the real place to go is Jack Flaps. Their pancakes are freaking amazing. Everyone raves about a short stack of the lemon curd pancakes, but I love the Benedicto Mexicano, which has cornbread, chorizo, gravy, crema, and sunny side up eggs. Best cup of coffee? Rising Star, of course. Then Six Shooter Coffee, a local roaster, is in the Waterloo neighborhood nearest the best wood-fired pizza in town, Citizen Pie. Pour Cleveland is a multi-roaster. Vintage Tea and Coffee is also good. Best place to see great art? The Cleveland Museum of Art is nothing short of amazing. Not only is it one of the few free museums remaining in the country, but it has Rodin’s Thinker and one of Monet’s water lilies. Nobody talks about how unbelievable it is. Also, the covered atrium there is one of the most beautiful places in town. Best market to eat your way around? West Side Market. It celebrated its 100 year anniversary a few years ago. There are fish, meat, spice, and produce vendors. If you want spices, try Urban Herbs. Then try Rooted in Cleveland for local produce and pour-over coffee. The other two I love are the crepe stand and also a fishmonger called Kate’s Fish, which is notable because we're not near water and the fish they sell is excellent. Best old-school Cleveland restaurant institution? Pier W is the old standby with the best seafood in all of Northeast Ohio; it overlooks the lake. The other one would be Johnny’s, a downtown fancy steakhouse restaurant that’s been there for several decades. But the Cleveland institution everyone raves about is Sokolowski’s. We have a large Eastern European population here, and this is THE place to get pierogies, cabbage, and the like. Hottest new restaurant in town? First, Mabel’s BBQ. It’s a Michael Symon project that’s reimagining Cleveland-style barbecue. Then there’s The Proper Pig. The Southern Café serves awesome Southern food. Also, I’m most excited about The Arcadian, which is trying to get as close to farm to table as it possibly can. On the more upscale end, there’s a French restaurant called L’Albatros that is absolutely to die for. I also should mention Happy Dog in Gordon Square. It’s a hipster hot dog hangout that serves great beer and a hot dog menu with wacky toppings like Sriracha, Froot Loops, and peanut butter. Which restaurants do you frequent? Superior Pho for one serves hands down the best pho in town. Then Caribe Bake Shop, which is a Latin American food restaurant that isn’t exactly a bakery the way its name says.\n\nTravel Update: COVID safety precautions are now at the discretion of individual business owners.

In fact, it was unabashed dog lover King Frederick of Prussia that first coined the phrase “man’s best friend” back in 1789. These three small words have since described a millenia-long bond between man and dog; a bond that has become increasingly strong with the passing of time. For modern-day dog owners, “man’s best friend” is a comrade to be included in every aspect of life. We buy fashionable outfits for our pups. We create social media accounts for our furry friends, proudly sharing images of our pets just as first-time parents would. And now, dog lovers can rejoice over the emergence of drinking establishments that are not only dog-friendly, but dog-centric. In this pup-friendly bar trend Neptune Beach’s own BrewHound Dog Park + Bar and Riverside’s Kanine Social are leading the pack. Just weeks ago, Lauren Wyckoff and Jason Underwood opened the doors (gates?) of BrewHound Dog Park + Bar. “We were visiting Orlando and got to thinking, if you can bring your kid to a waterpark and have a drink, why can’t you go somewhere to have a beer with your dog?” reasons Wyckoff. “At the time, we hadn’t heard of anywhere where you could do that.”\nThe duo then set out to create a community-driven space filled with pups and local libations. “Our main goal was to get people together enjoying something outdoors so that they can have a greater appreciation of the environment,” says Wyckoff, who, along with Underwood is a self-proclaimed outdoor enthusiast. “When people visit the park, they’re engaging and meeting with people, which is what it’s all about.”\nFeaturing lots of rustic decor, BrewHound offers its two-legged customers a rotating variety of local craft beers, wine on tap, and Bold Bean specialty coffee. Owners can sip and stroll with their furry friends in “The Yard,” BrewHound’s off-leash dog park with daily, monthly, and annual memberships available. If you’re a dog-lover in search of a brew closer to downtown, College Street’s Kanine Social welcomes pups and owners alike to sit and stay for a cool beverage. Owners Daniel Moffatt and Dustin Fries opened Kanine in 2017, becoming Jax’s first boutique doggie daycare and private dog park to pair with a craft beer and coffee bar. “We first talked about the idea of opening a dog park and bar four or five years ago,” Moffatt explains. “We were always looking for a place where we could bring our dogs, enjoy a beer and watch a football game.”\nKanine’s taproom is open to the public, serving up beer on tap, wine, and ciders, while patron’s pups can avail themselves of some off-leash exercise. These amenities are paired with Kanine Social’s dog daycare. “Our concept allows them [patrons] the freedom to let their dogs run and play,” says Moffatt. “While enjoying a beer and having time to meet up with old friends or make new friends.”\nThough Kanine Social hasn’t been open to the public for quite a year yet, Moffatt and Fries have their eyes set toward opening a second location in the next 18-24 months.\n\nDogs are welcome, at least under certain circumstances, in more places with each passing year. A number of parks, schools, hotels and hospitals now allow dogs, and a wide variety of businesses let both employees and customers bring their dogs with them. There are still a lot of places that are off limits to our four-legged family members, and this continues to affect most people with dogs. I was recently at a local bookstore that allows dogs, but the café inside the store is for people only. There is a very nice sign saying that health codes prohibit them from welcoming dogs to the café, though they are welcome in the rest of the store. The staff works very hard to accommodate people who have brought their dog to the bookstore and would like a cup of coffee by bringing their orders out of the café and into the main part of the bookstore. I’m sure many dog guardians skip the café because they can’t sit down and enjoy a drink if accompanied by a dog. However, many people do request “delivery” to the main part of the store, and seem appreciative of the option. Years ago I worked with a woman who would hardly go anywhere without her dog. She brought him to work, which was allowed as we worked at a facility that provided dog training, dog grooming and dog day care. This woman never went to the movies because her dog was not allowed to go with her, and never ate in restaurants for the same reason. She made some concessions to practicality such as going to the grocery store or on other errands alone, but she generally only went where her dog was allowed to come, too. She made decisions that many could consider extreme, but they certainly worked for her and for her dog. Her social life was affected by her unwillingness to go places without her dog, but she has always been very happy with her choices and has a good life. Are there any places you don’t go because of restrictions that prevent your dog from coming, too?\n\nThis search will also help you identify some pet-friendly dining options before you ever leave home. If few options exist, create a backup plan: Will the hotel allow you to leave your pet crated in the hotel room? Or can you order in food or even prepare your own meals in your room? Regardless of where you’re traveling, be sure to comply with local leash laws and always clean up after your pet as a courtesy to others who are sharing the public or private space. Prep Your Hosts\nIf you’re planning to stay with a family or friend along the way, be upfront about your pet’s needs so there are no surprises. You’ll also need to ask about the house rules:\n- Are pets allowed on the furniture? - Can dogs do their business in the yard, or would your hosts prefer that you go for a morning and evening walk? - Is the yard fenced? - Do your friends have other animals in the home? Do they have kids? - Is there a safe room for your pet to stay if you leave the house, or will you need to bring along a crate? - All of these questions will help make your stay more peaceful and comfortable for everyone. Choose Your Mode of Transportation\nMany traditional travel options are off limits to pets. Here are some considerations when planning your trip:\nRental cars: The majority of rental car agencies have pet-friendly policies and allow dogs and cats in the car. Some may require your pet to be crated during travel, and agencies may apply extra fees for any damage or necessary cleaning. Buses: Certain cities like Seattle have pet-friendly policies that allow leashed dogs on public transportation. But most national bus chains don’t allow animals. Subways: Check your local destinations for their pet policies. Some subways allow leashed or contained animals to ride when accompanied by their owner. Ferry lines: Most ferry lines allow pets on board if they remain with their humans in the car, and some have adopted policies that allow animals in specific areas of the vessel. Trains: Most trains will not allow pets on board or in cargo areas. However, there are always exceptions. Certain European countries have more open travel options for pets. Cruises: While many small carriers offer one- to three-hour “sightseeing” cruises for people and their pets, animals aren’t traditionally welcome on ocean liners. One exception is Cunard’s Queen Mary 2, which offers a transatlantic voyage starting or ending in New York, as well as European voyages. The ship boasts an onboard kennel area for housing dogs and cats, space for walking dogs, and designated areas for guests to spend time with their pets. Airlines: Each airline has its own restrictions and fees when it comes to transporting pets, and the size of your pet is a big consideration. Small pets traveling in the cabin will need to fit within the seat space. If your pet is too big to fit under the seat, you’ll need an airline-approved crate with proper ventilation for transporting your pal in one of the plane’s climate-controlled cargo areas. Restrictions also apply to certain breeds. For instance, snub-nosed breeds of dogs and cats — like Pugs, Bulldogs, and Persian or Burmese cats — may be restricted from flying in cargo areas, depending on several factors, including the ambient temperature at that time of the year. Other airlines limit cabin travel for so-called “dangerous” breeds. As for fees, expect to pay between $100 and $200 to transport your pet one way, depending on his size. When booking your ticket, also consider leaving layover time for potty breaks if your pet is traveling with you in the cabin. Many airports offer dog relief areas so you can make a pit stop before boarding your next flight. Be prepared to go back through security if the rest areas aren’t adjacent to your concourse. Make Car Safety a Priority\nIt’s important to keep pets secured in the back-seat area to prevent them from distracting the driver. Also, the front seat is more dangerous for dogs and cats because the front airbags can seriously hurt or kill pets on impact. When looking at car restraints, it’s important to consider their two primary functions: keeping the animal contained and protecting him in the event of a crash.\n\n7 Dog Destinations\n- 6 July 2018\n- 0 Comments\n- Pet Wants\nChoose from Seven Great Dog Destinations\nfor a Memorable Summer Vacation\nFrom east to west across our great nation, more and more travel destinations are featuring pet-friendly activities and accommodations. As you plan this year’s summer getaway — before making arrangements with a pet sitter or a kennel — take a look at these seven great dog destinations. Each location offers a variety of outdoor activities, dining options, accommodations, and good times galore. Which one gets your tail wagging? - The Finger Lakes Region, New York – Dozens of local marinas and wineries throughout the vicinity welcome well-mannered dogs. As well, canines are welcome to accompany you on some boat excursions and on the many scenic walking paths. Throughout this quaint, picturesque area, pet-friendly rentals and outdoor dining spots abound. - Middleburg, Virginia – Just 25 miles west of Washington, D.C., the Salamander Resort and Spa provides amenities for your dogs that include a pet bed, bowls for food and water, healthy treats, and a brand new toy. Dog sitting is available if you’d like to visit the nearby wineries. - Hocking Hills, Ohio – Hidden in the rolling hills of southeastern Ohio, Hocking Hills State Park offers miles of walking trails and scenic areas where leashed dogs are welcome. You’ll find plenty of pet-welcoming rentals situated close to the 2,400-acre park. The nearby town of Logan offers a variety of pet friendly dining options. - Chicago – While the city of Chicago is known for being “the windy city,” it also happens to be quite dog friendly. Visit Wiggly Field at Southpaw Dog Park on the city’s west side and Montrose Beach on Lake Michigan (both parks require licenses and leashes). Additionally, enjoy miles of paved walking paths along Lake Michigan for scenic walks together. - Austin, Texas – The Doghouse Drinkery in the nearby city of Leander is a dog park — with an easy-access bar for you — that features two large off-leash play areas. At nearby Red Bud Isle Park, you can run, jog, walk, or swim along with your pooch; extra-wide paved pathways along the river add to the enjoyment. - George, Utah – At the Red Mountain Resort, enjoy 55 acres to run, play, walk and explore. Your accommodations include food and water dishes plus healthy organic snacks for the pups. On-site activities include wellness programs where dogs are welcome to participate with their human friends. - Carmel-by-the-Sea, California – On the shores at Carmel Beach, dogs are welcome to openly enjoy the sand, sun, sea, and surf with their favorite people. In the evenings, dog parties are common here, so the two of you just might receive an invitation. Choose from 25 nearby hotels and inns where pets receive VIP treatment. With so many exciting options, it may be difficult to choose just one vacation spot. But whatever your choice, enjoying time away with your pups will create memories that last a lifetime. It’s time to put on your sunglasses, stick your head out the window, and let your ears flap in the wind (figuratively)!\n\nSome of the guys who show up for happy hour at the Bark Bar don't bother with formalities when they spot a female. They get directly to enthusiastic sniffing. Of course, dogs can get away with the sort of behavior that would not end well if the mammal at the other end of the leash tried it. The humans do their share of scouting the opposite sex, but they trade puppy tales instead of sniffing each other. In an age of craft beer and effete cocktails, some pubs literally are deciding to go to the dogs. From Oregon to Florida, bar owners are finding that mixing drinking and dogs is good for business, especially in Denver, which surveys rank among the country's top dog-friendliest cities. And not just those little dogs that fit in purses, either. Service dogs have always been allowed in these establishments. But dog bars also welcome Great Pyrenees, Bernese Mountain Dogs, mutts, Tibetan Terriers and just about any other relatively obedient canine with a cold, inquisitive nose. Denver dogs and their owners can visit at least three local bars that offer a canine play area — the Bark Bar, the Watering Bowl and the Ugly Dog Sports Bar. Local 46currently allows dogs on-leash in its backyard beer garden, and the Tavern Uptownplans a remodel that will include a self-service bar and a dog patio. The Bark Bar and the Watering Bowl both offer fenced outdoor spaces that are the equivalent of small dog parks, with outdoor seating and tactfully placed plastic bags and scoops. \"A dog park is what inspired us — my husband and I were at the Berkeley dog park with our two dogs, and he wanted a coffee, and I wanted a craft beer,\" said owner Catherine Peters. \"I said, 'Wouldn't it be great if there was a dog park bar?' and he said, 'Sweetie, you should do that.' And we opened on Christmas Day last year. Best Christmas present ever!\" It's a concept whose time has come, says University of Denver adjunct professor Shadi Farhangrazi. \"Look at the demographic: In Colorado, we love our dogs, we love being outside, and we love fun, so this idea really is quite innovative. I'd compare it to other innovative trends, like having a Starbucks inside a Barnes & Noble so people buy coffee but maybe a book or magazine also, and having a cafe inside a supermarket like Whole Foods.\"\n\n#4 Coolest Dog-Friendly Place in Budapest: Pótkulcs\nLocation: Csengery u. 65b, 1067\nWhy it’s COOL: This is a unique spot for nightlife, branching away from your typical Budapest bar scene. If you hail from the Bay Area and miss the Berkeley-type vibe, this is right up your alley. While I’m far from being a hippie yorkie, I do love hidden gems and local spots; this is an untainted, marvelous nook that’s sweetly tucked away. You can relax in its laid-back outdoor patio, mingle with the down-to-earth locals and students, or hold hands and dance to soothing live music in the nook. The only problem you may have is finding the place; if you happen to come across a building covered with ivy and no apparent entrance, you have found the place. Just walk through the hidden door and savor the unforgettable experience. What my tail WAGS to: Tasty drinks + wonderful music + earthy people = ONE AWESOME NIGHT. #5 Coolest Place in Budapest: Kőleves kert\nLocation: Kazinczy u. 37, 1075\nWhy it’s COOL: On hot summer nights in Budapest, I like to drink generous pints of cold beer at this effervescent, colorful beer garden.

What my tail WAGS to: Chicken Paprika, Beef Goulash, and traditional Hungarian Egg Noodles\n#7 Coolest Dog-Friendly Place in Budapest: Stifler Bar\nLocation: Erzsébet krt. 19, 1073\nWhy it’s COOL: This colorful sports bar is a TOP DOG place to take your dog to get your furry paws on a few iced cold Dreher Baks and watch a few football games while you’re at it. The ambiance is usually chill and laid-back (and not supaw noisy), just pawfect for a fun outing with your dog. Dogs are welcome to wine and dine inside (and ARF-course, go for an anaconda lick of those juicy burgers and greasy fries). What my tail WAGS to: Beers, beers, and beers…bar food GALORE! #8 Coolest Dog-Friendly Place in Budapest: Hummus Bar\nLocation: Hollan Erno utca 6 (local chain with many locations)\nWhy it’s COOL: Hummus Bar represents the hip new age of Middle Eastern restaurants in Europe: quick and efficient over-the-counter service with fresh, healthy food that makes you feel oh so GOOD. A light and simple atmosphere that makes you feel at ease while licking hummus off your plate. You will get a dynamic mix of hummus and olive oil in practically every single dish, hence its name to fame.\n\nIf you want to provide your dog with a dependable area so it can swim and cool off when the temperature gets hot, then you can do so in your backyard if you decide to..

Except Cleveland is a city with its own swagger, and a cost of living so low that Stockham said, \"You can buy a house for less than a car, and you should never pay full retail price for anything here.\" Also: Cleveland is the place for a hipster hotdog hangout that puts Froot Loops on its dogs, a brewery that has residents lining up for Christmas-spiced beer, and one of the world's best symphony orchestras. Come hungry, and let Stockham be your guide. Where should we stay? If you stay downtown, you can't go wrong. My favorite is Wallace Manor Bed and Breakfast in Ohio City; it’s a beautiful old, Victorian-era building that was recently renovated. The owners are super friendly and take care of people really well. We also have a Westin downtown that’s attached to Urban Farmer, a steakhouse that sources what it can locally. Other hotels to consider: the Metropolitan at the Nine, a luxury hotel-condo-restaurant complex, which is new, and a big deal for Cleveland; the new Hilton; and the Drury Hotel, because it’s in a converted school district administration building and is all marble. Where should we grab breakfast? Urban Farmer has a great brunch. But the real place to go is Jack Flaps. Their pancakes are freaking amazing. Everyone raves about a short stack of the lemon curd pancakes, but I love the Benedicto Mexicano, which has cornbread, chorizo, gravy, crema, and sunny side up eggs. Best cup of coffee? Rising Star, of course. Then Six Shooter Coffee, a local roaster, is in the Waterloo neighborhood nearest the best wood-fired pizza in town, Citizen Pie. Pour Cleveland is a multi-roaster. Vintage Tea and Coffee is also good. Best place to see great art? The Cleveland Museum of Art is nothing short of amazing. Not only is it one of the few free museums remaining in the country, but it has Rodin’s Thinker and one of Monet’s water lilies. Nobody talks about how unbelievable it is. Also, the covered atrium there is one of the most beautiful places in town. Best market to eat your way around? West Side Market. It celebrated its 100 year anniversary a few years ago. There are fish, meat, spice, and produce vendors. If you want spices, try Urban Herbs. Then try Rooted in Cleveland for local produce and pour-over coffee. The other two I love are the crepe stand and also a fishmonger called Kate’s Fish, which is notable because we're not near water and the fish they sell is excellent. Best old-school Cleveland restaurant institution? Pier W is the old standby with the best seafood in all of Northeast Ohio; it overlooks the lake. The other one would be Johnny’s, a downtown fancy steakhouse restaurant that’s been there for several decades. But the Cleveland institution everyone raves about is Sokolowski’s. We have a large Eastern European population here, and this is THE place to get pierogies, cabbage, and the like. Hottest new restaurant in town? First, Mabel’s BBQ. It’s a Michael Symon project that’s reimagining Cleveland-style barbecue. Then there’s The Proper Pig. The Southern Café serves awesome Southern food. Also, I’m most excited about The Arcadian, which is trying to get as close to farm to table as it possibly can. On the more upscale end, there’s a French restaurant called L’Albatros that is absolutely to die for. I also should mention Happy Dog in Gordon Square. It’s a hipster hot dog hangout that serves great beer and a hot dog menu with wacky toppings like Sriracha, Froot Loops, and peanut butter. Which restaurants do you frequent? Superior Pho for one serves hands down the best pho in town. Then Caribe Bake Shop, which is a Latin American food restaurant that isn’t exactly a bakery the way its name says.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:eb36cdec-a1a2-4939-94f5-6519a6415da1>"]},{"passage":"Travel Update: COVID safety precautions are now at the discretion of individual business owners.

In fact, it was unabashed dog lover King Frederick of Prussia that first coined the phrase “man’s best friend” back in 1789. These three small words have since described a millenia-long bond between man and dog; a bond that has become increasingly strong with the passing of time. For modern-day dog owners, “man’s best friend” is a comrade to be included in every aspect of life. We buy fashionable outfits for our pups. We create social media accounts for our furry friends, proudly sharing images of our pets just as first-time parents would. And now, dog lovers can rejoice over the emergence of drinking establishments that are not only dog-friendly, but dog-centric. In this pup-friendly bar trend Neptune Beach’s own BrewHound Dog Park + Bar and Riverside’s Kanine Social are leading the pack. Just weeks ago, Lauren Wyckoff and Jason Underwood opened the doors (gates?) of BrewHound Dog Park + Bar. “We were visiting Orlando and got to thinking, if you can bring your kid to a waterpark and have a drink, why can’t you go somewhere to have a beer with your dog?” reasons Wyckoff. “At the time, we hadn’t heard of anywhere where you could do that.”\nThe duo then set out to create a community-driven space filled with pups and local libations. “Our main goal was to get people together enjoying something outdoors so that they can have a greater appreciation of the environment,” says Wyckoff, who, along with Underwood is a self-proclaimed outdoor enthusiast. “When people visit the park, they’re engaging and meeting with people, which is what it’s all about.”\nFeaturing lots of rustic decor, BrewHound offers its two-legged customers a rotating variety of local craft beers, wine on tap, and Bold Bean specialty coffee. Owners can sip and stroll with their furry friends in “The Yard,” BrewHound’s off-leash dog park with daily, monthly, and annual memberships available. If you’re a dog-lover in search of a brew closer to downtown, College Street’s Kanine Social welcomes pups and owners alike to sit and stay for a cool beverage. Owners Daniel Moffatt and Dustin Fries opened Kanine in 2017, becoming Jax’s first boutique doggie daycare and private dog park to pair with a craft beer and coffee bar. “We first talked about the idea of opening a dog park and bar four or five years ago,” Moffatt explains. “We were always looking for a place where we could bring our dogs, enjoy a beer and watch a football game.”\nKanine’s taproom is open to the public, serving up beer on tap, wine, and ciders, while patron’s pups can avail themselves of some off-leash exercise. These amenities are paired with Kanine Social’s dog daycare. “Our concept allows them [patrons] the freedom to let their dogs run and play,” says Moffatt. “While enjoying a beer and having time to meet up with old friends or make new friends.”\nThough Kanine Social hasn’t been open to the public for quite a year yet, Moffatt and Fries have their eyes set toward opening a second location in the next 18-24 months.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:80965d7e-3492-4c8e-8ef7-ba5d0304e7e0>"]},{"passage":"Dogs are welcome, at least under certain circumstances, in more places with each passing year. A number of parks, schools, hotels and hospitals now allow dogs, and a wide variety of businesses let both employees and customers bring their dogs with them. There are still a lot of places that are off limits to our four-legged family members, and this continues to affect most people with dogs. I was recently at a local bookstore that allows dogs, but the café inside the store is for people only. There is a very nice sign saying that health codes prohibit them from welcoming dogs to the café, though they are welcome in the rest of the store. The staff works very hard to accommodate people who have brought their dog to the bookstore and would like a cup of coffee by bringing their orders out of the café and into the main part of the bookstore. I’m sure many dog guardians skip the café because they can’t sit down and enjoy a drink if accompanied by a dog. However, many people do request “delivery” to the main part of the store, and seem appreciative of the option. Years ago I worked with a woman who would hardly go anywhere without her dog. She brought him to work, which was allowed as we worked at a facility that provided dog training, dog grooming and dog day care. This woman never went to the movies because her dog was not allowed to go with her, and never ate in restaurants for the same reason. She made some concessions to practicality such as going to the grocery store or on other errands alone, but she generally only went where her dog was allowed to come, too. She made decisions that many could consider extreme, but they certainly worked for her and for her dog. Her social life was affected by her unwillingness to go places without her dog, but she has always been very happy with her choices and has a good life. Are there any places you don’t go because of restrictions that prevent your dog from coming, too?","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:2074f70e-250b-4d43-8c63-77d4f989422f>"]},{"passage":"This search will also help you identify some pet-friendly dining options before you ever leave home. If few options exist, create a backup plan: Will the hotel allow you to leave your pet crated in the hotel room? Or can you order in food or even prepare your own meals in your room? Regardless of where you’re traveling, be sure to comply with local leash laws and always clean up after your pet as a courtesy to others who are sharing the public or private space. Prep Your Hosts\nIf you’re planning to stay with a family or friend along the way, be upfront about your pet’s needs so there are no surprises. You’ll also need to ask about the house rules:\n- Are pets allowed on the furniture? - Can dogs do their business in the yard, or would your hosts prefer that you go for a morning and evening walk? - Is the yard fenced? - Do your friends have other animals in the home? Do they have kids? - Is there a safe room for your pet to stay if you leave the house, or will you need to bring along a crate? - All of these questions will help make your stay more peaceful and comfortable for everyone. Choose Your Mode of Transportation\nMany traditional travel options are off limits to pets. Here are some considerations when planning your trip:\nRental cars: The majority of rental car agencies have pet-friendly policies and allow dogs and cats in the car. Some may require your pet to be crated during travel, and agencies may apply extra fees for any damage or necessary cleaning. Buses: Certain cities like Seattle have pet-friendly policies that allow leashed dogs on public transportation. But most national bus chains don’t allow animals. Subways: Check your local destinations for their pet policies. Some subways allow leashed or contained animals to ride when accompanied by their owner. Ferry lines: Most ferry lines allow pets on board if they remain with their humans in the car, and some have adopted policies that allow animals in specific areas of the vessel.

When looking at car restraints, it’s important to consider their two primary functions: keeping the animal contained and protecting him in the event of a crash.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:36fd1ea3-cec8-436e-a8a1-e8b4a1bd252b>"]},{"passage":"7 Dog Destinations\n- 6 July 2018\n- 0 Comments\n- Pet Wants\nChoose from Seven Great Dog Destinations\nfor a Memorable Summer Vacation\nFrom east to west across our great nation, more and more travel destinations are featuring pet-friendly activities and accommodations. As you plan this year’s summer getaway — before making arrangements with a pet sitter or a kennel — take a look at these seven great dog destinations. Each location offers a variety of outdoor activities, dining options, accommodations, and good times galore. Which one gets your tail wagging? - The Finger Lakes Region, New York – Dozens of local marinas and wineries throughout the vicinity welcome well-mannered dogs. As well, canines are welcome to accompany you on some boat excursions and on the many scenic walking paths. Throughout this quaint, picturesque area, pet-friendly rentals and outdoor dining spots abound. - Middleburg, Virginia – Just 25 miles west of Washington, D.C., the Salamander Resort and Spa provides amenities for your dogs that include a pet bed, bowls for food and water, healthy treats, and a brand new toy. Dog sitting is available if you’d like to visit the nearby wineries. - Hocking Hills, Ohio – Hidden in the rolling hills of southeastern Ohio, Hocking Hills State Park offers miles of walking trails and scenic areas where leashed dogs are welcome. You’ll find plenty of pet-welcoming rentals situated close to the 2,400-acre park. The nearby town of Logan offers a variety of pet friendly dining options. - Chicago – While the city of Chicago is known for being “the windy city,” it also happens to be quite dog friendly. Visit Wiggly Field at Southpaw Dog Park on the city’s west side and Montrose Beach on Lake Michigan (both parks require licenses and leashes). Additionally, enjoy miles of paved walking paths along Lake Michigan for scenic walks together. - Austin, Texas – The Doghouse Drinkery in the nearby city of Leander is a dog park — with an easy-access bar for you — that features two large off-leash play areas. At nearby Red Bud Isle Park, you can run, jog, walk, or swim along with your pooch; extra-wide paved pathways along the river add to the enjoyment. - George, Utah – At the Red Mountain Resort, enjoy 55 acres to run, play, walk and explore. Your accommodations include food and water dishes plus healthy organic snacks for the pups. On-site activities include wellness programs where dogs are welcome to participate with their human friends. - Carmel-by-the-Sea, California – On the shores at Carmel Beach, dogs are welcome to openly enjoy the sand, sun, sea, and surf with their favorite people. In the evenings, dog parties are common here, so the two of you just might receive an invitation. Choose from 25 nearby hotels and inns where pets receive VIP treatment. With so many exciting options, it may be difficult to choose just one vacation spot. But whatever your choice, enjoying time away with your pups will create memories that last a lifetime. It’s time to put on your sunglasses, stick your head out the window, and let your ears flap in the wind (figuratively)!","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:20057de8-7da5-4b58-8864-c1ae81e89867>"]},{"passage":"Some of the guys who show up for happy hour at the Bark Bar don't bother with formalities when they spot a female. They get directly to enthusiastic sniffing. Of course, dogs can get away with the sort of behavior that would not end well if the mammal at the other end of the leash tried it. The humans do their share of scouting the opposite sex, but they trade puppy tales instead of sniffing each other. In an age of craft beer and effete cocktails, some pubs literally are deciding to go to the dogs. From Oregon to Florida, bar owners are finding that mixing drinking and dogs is good for business, especially in Denver, which surveys rank among the country's top dog-friendliest cities. And not just those little dogs that fit in purses, either. Service dogs have always been allowed in these establishments. But dog bars also welcome Great Pyrenees, Bernese Mountain Dogs, mutts, Tibetan Terriers and just about any other relatively obedient canine with a cold, inquisitive nose. Denver dogs and their owners can visit at least three local bars that offer a canine play area — the Bark Bar, the Watering Bowl and the Ugly Dog Sports Bar. Local 46currently allows dogs on-leash in its backyard beer garden, and the Tavern Uptownplans a remodel that will include a self-service bar and a dog patio. The Bark Bar and the Watering Bowl both offer fenced outdoor spaces that are the equivalent of small dog parks, with outdoor seating and tactfully placed plastic bags and scoops. \"A dog park is what inspired us — my husband and I were at the Berkeley dog park with our two dogs, and he wanted a coffee, and I wanted a craft beer,\" said owner Catherine Peters. \"I said, 'Wouldn't it be great if there was a dog park bar?' and he said, 'Sweetie, you should do that.' And we opened on Christmas Day last year. Best Christmas present ever!\" It's a concept whose time has come, says University of Denver adjunct professor Shadi Farhangrazi. \"Look at the demographic: In Colorado, we love our dogs, we love being outside, and we love fun, so this idea really is quite innovative. I'd compare it to other innovative trends, like having a Starbucks inside a Barnes & Noble so people buy coffee but maybe a book or magazine also, and having a cafe inside a supermarket like Whole Foods.\"","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e1efcf1c-ec5b-4fa3-b793-dbf8f9edc491>"]},{"passage":"#4 Coolest Dog-Friendly Place in Budapest: Pótkulcs\nLocation: Csengery u. 65b, 1067\nWhy it’s COOL: This is a unique spot for nightlife, branching away from your typical Budapest bar scene.

Camping is one of my absolute favorite ways to spend a long weekend, but I know that for a lot of people, just the idea of spending a night or two outdoors sounds nothing short of horrendous – and, yes, without the proper precautions, it can be!\nBut the more you camp, the more you learn, and I thought it would be fun to share some of the tips and tricks I’ve learned (usually the hard way) to make your next camping trip the best one yet.\nAnd if something still goes wrong? Trust me when I say that some of my favorite camping memories are the ones where everything went to shit (like that time we ended up eating eggs at a Denny’s at midnight amid a torrential downpour that flooded the campground’s latrines…it’s funny now, though!).\nSo, without further ado, here are my camping essentials!\n1. Pack LAYERS.\nThere is nothing worse than being cold (and I lived in freakin’ Sweden for nearly ten years, so I know). Even if you think bringing that extra sweater or pair of leggings seems ridiculous, just do it. You’ll be so grateful later. I always do like my dear Mama, and wear a pair of long underwear when camping, as it is much easier to remove layers if you’re too hot. Also, sleeping bags may keep your body warm, but I always bring an extra pair of socks, gloves, and a hat to keep my extremities warm and toasty all night long. As we say in Sweden, there’s no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothes!\n2. Anticipate darkness.\nThis may sound totally obvious, but, out in nature, there is this concept of night, and, away from the modern luxury of electricity, night time is usually quite DARK. While this means you’ll get to see some incredible stars, I always, always, always seem to forget how hard it is to manage in pitch black darkness. Plan ahead and bring as many flashlights, torches, headlamps (the best), as you can because you will need them. One of my favorite camping hacks? Strap a headlamp onto a gallon jug of water or milk for an instant portable lamp.\n3. Pack sustainable food.\nWhen I say ‘sustainable’, I’m referring to food that will a) survive no or little refrigeration, b) be able to handle lots of movement, and c) still be appealing three days later. I always take a cooler when I camp, but, depending on the length of your trip, that may or may not ensure that all your food stays fresh the whole time. My favorite thing to do is to plan all of the meals ahead of time, and shop accordingly. Also, make sure to prep your food for easy cleanup\/cooking time. If you want eggs for breakfast, crack them into a ziplock bag for easy transportation along with any cheese, salt\/pepper\/veggies, etc., that you want to add. If you want to grill hamburgers for dinner, wash, chop, and separate all your ingredients ahead of time to avoid doing so at the campsite. My favorite foods to bring on a camping trip are make-ahead breakfast burritos, kettle corn, foil-wrapped dinners, hot dogs\/bratwursts, sandwich supplies (pb&j, ham and cheese, turkey, sprouts, mustard, etc.), and, of course, s’mores!\n4. Embrace the gross\nDepending on your level of comfort when it comes to roughing-it, camping usually means that you’ll be shower-less for the next few days. Instead of focusing on how gross that might be, just embrace it! It’s not like you have a job interview later that day or something (and if you do, reschedule immediately). Instead, focus on little ways to feel fresh sans shower, like brushing your teeth (totally doable with a bottle of water), changing your underwear daily (seriously, this makes a HUGE difference), and, if you have long hair, putting it up into an up-do of some kind (I usually go for french braids) to keep it off your face. In a few days’ time, you’ll be back in your lovely, warm shower, promise!\n5. Anticipate problems\nKnock on wood, you won’t need to break out your first-aid-kit or car jack, but I’m a firm believer in the idea that being unprepared is just asking for trouble. Always let someone know where you’re going (especially if going alone, which I do not recommend unless you’re a seasoned outdoors-person, and even then, remember this???). Make sure you always have:\n- Lots of water\n- Toilet paper\n- A good knife\n- A lighter or box of matches\n- First aid kit\n- A map and compass\n- Storm-proof outdoor gear\n- A way of contacting someone in case of emergency (phone, walkie-talkie, etc.)\n6. Bring some of the good stuff\nCamping is a bit of work, but that doesn’t mean that it shouldn’t be enjoyable! I always make sure to bring a good bottle of wine or flask of whiskey, a pack of playing cards, a frisbee or soccer ball, some comfortable lawn chairs, a hammock, a good book, and a portable radio for some of the quieter moments.\nAlways make sure to research where you’re going and what there is nearby before leaving for your trip. Your phone will most likely not work once there, so having some print outs of fun activities in the area can be great when you want to explore your surroundings. It’s also a good idea to know where the nearest store or town is in case of emergency (like running out of toilet paper!) or if you just absolutely need a ‘real’ cup of coffee in the morning.\nDo you have any good camping tips to share?

This practice helps prevent bacterial and fungal infections, such as jock itch and urinary tract infections, which can thrive in damp and sweaty conditions.

Answer: No! Let’s face it, we travelers put up with a lot of aggravation on the road: lost baggage, missing passports, loud hostels, etc. . . . And we see a lot of things that bother us around the world: obnoxious tourists, environmental degradation, the plight of the world’s poor. But there’s one thing that annoys us the most, and which is constantly on our minds. Yes, I’m talking about your underwear. How many times have you, midway through your trip, with nary a laundry machine to be had, thought to yourself, “I wish I didn’t have to change my underwear so darn often!”\nWell, you are in luck, for our nation’s best and brightest scientists, chemical engineers, microbiologists, and PHD-toting eggheads have put aside some time (finally!) from their — let’s face it, kind of fruitless — endeavors such as finding a cure for HIV\/AIDS, solving economic disparity, and addressing climate change, and finally tackled that age-old world issue: the irritation of changing your underwear. I introduce to you the Give-N-Go underwear from ExOficio: the world’s first underwear that does not need to be washed (very often). To you, the intrepid traveler, who asks, “Why do I need to change my underwear so often?”, ExOficio says, “Don’t!”\nThese space-age undies’ tag line, in Draper-esque fashion are: “17 countries. 6 Weeks. One pair of underwear. Okay, maybe two.” But we know they really mean one, right? A look at their package reveals what exactly these bad boys do: “[Give-N-Go’s are] high performance and low maintenance. Treated with Aegis Microbe Shield they’re odor resistant and perfect for tricky climates and active adventures.” Please, no more selling is necessary. You had me at the words “Microbe Shield.”\nAnd forget the Parisian runways, this line of underwear (and I’m not making this up) is advertised as being both “field tested and approved” by the African Wildlife Foundation, an organization you may not have realized was so intimately involved in the world of haute coutre. But let’s not take their word for it, let’s take a look at some of the (incredibly) non-anonymous customer reviews left on the underwear’s Amazon page (And for those keeping score, there were 28 five-star, one four-star, and only one one-star reviews). One very proud owner remarked, “You can live on two pairs of these — wash one at night, wear the other. Wrap it in a towel, stomp dry — should be ready in a few hours.” And here you’ve just been using your towel for your body all this time. And how about this astonished user: “Care for this item is almost too simple. I wash mine in the bathroom sink with a very small amount of detergent and hang dry for a few hours and they are ready to go again.” Oh to be that bathroom-goer lucky enough to get to use that sink right after him. (Well, at least he said he uses detergent.) And finally, where there’s a happy underwear wearer, there’s a happy mom. This from a proud mother who got her entire family in on the act: “This item was purchased for my son who was traveling to another country. He thanked me so much upon his return. He was with a group that was camping for several weeks and said this boxer brief was the most comfortable to wear, the most convenient to launder and quickest to dry. I then purchased one for another son who travels; he agrees.” It’s stories like these that get recounted during funeral eulogies and around the buffet table at wakes by bereaved children; this mother has certainly fulfilled her parental duties.\n\n- Don’t take unnecessary electronics you don’t need a laptop, iPad, or anything during camping but still you need a mobile and GPS device in an emergency instead you can place a compass or navigation paper map. - Don’t bring jewelry or some good clothes you will never need jewelry or some good clothing so never overweight yourself. And try to keep the rough clothing stuff that can be lost or damaged without causing worry. - Don’t pack anything with a strong odor or strong fragrance as they can attract wild animals or bears. It is better to avoid such things to keep yourself well protected. FAQs about camping\n1. How to deal with weather changes? As discussed earlier, always dress in layers.

As long as we wash them after each wear, they can stay in our top drawer for years, right? Wrong. Well, that’s according to the Good Housekeeping Institute (GHI) guide, which says that despite washing meticulously after use, most people’s clean underwear contains up to 10,000 living bacteria! We know – gross. So how long does underwear last? When should we be throwing our trusty undies away? How long to keep underwear\nBased on the Good Housekeeping Institute’s findings, we should be throwing out underwear every year for health reasons. These include reducing the risk of urinary tract infections, thrush and allergies. Underwear should be laundered after each wear on the hot wash setting. But despite this, an examination by the UK’s leading cleaning company, Dr Beckmann, found up to one million bacteria lurking in just two tablespoons of used washing machine water. We know. We want to go home and set light to all our old undies immediately. Ok, that might be a bit far-fetched. We don’t want to get in trouble for encouraging arson! But we do want to encourage you to think about how long you’ve hung onto your undies and have a think about whether it’s time to buy a new pair of underwear or five. Wash your tea towels separately\nIt might surprise you to learn that simple habits are helping bacteria thrive. So much so that those simple habits are actually becoming dirty habits. It’s not just our underwear we should be worried about, it’s what we’re washing with our underwear. In the GHI’s guidelines, it was also revealed that up to 90% of dirty tea towels contained E. Coli bacteria. To avoid these nasty germs, we suggest washing your tea towels and towels separately from your underwear. The GHI guidelines tell us that underwear should be changed daily, nightwear after three nights of sleep and bedding once a week. All of them should be washed at high temperatures, so to kill any nasty bacteria. Elsewhere, it was reported that pillows need to be laundered every three to six months and duvets twice a year. Washing avoiders, take note! Is your washing machine doing its job properly? So, we know that regularly washing our underwear in hot water is key to killing bacteria, dust mites and other nasty things that result in infections and allergies. But when it comes to our washing machine, how do we know it’s even doing its job correctly? Well, according to the GHI guidelines, most of the time they’re not. Here are some top tips to get the most out of each wash:\n- Wipe out the detergent drawer on your washing machine to prevent soap building up, and clean it thoroughly in hot, soapy water every few months. - Run an empty monthly service wash with hot water to rid the machine of mould and bacteria. - Check and clean the drain filters. Wipe the rubber seal with diluted bleach or vinegar to prevent the build-up of bacteria or mould. But, despite best practices when it comes to your washing machine, it’s still important to overhaul your underwear drawer each year to avoid the spread of nasty infections. Choose the right fabric\nWhile refreshing your undie drawer frequently is key to keeping you healthy, knowing how to initially choose the right underwear is just as important. Did you know that some fabrics could naturally help you keep your undies germ-free? Natural fibres such as bamboo have been found to be both antibacterial and breathable, helping you keep unwanted bacteria from developing. There’s lots of benefits to choosing bamboo over other traditional or synthetic fabrics, so why not try it out for yourself? Get started with our organically-grown bamboo underwear for him and her.

Answer: No! Let’s face it, we travelers put up with a lot of aggravation on the road: lost baggage, missing passports, loud hostels, etc. . . . And we see a lot of things that bother us around the world: obnoxious tourists, environmental degradation, the plight of the world’s poor. But there’s one thing that annoys us the most, and which is constantly on our minds. Yes, I’m talking about your underwear. How many times have you, midway through your trip, with nary a laundry machine to be had, thought to yourself, “I wish I didn’t have to change my underwear so darn often!”\nWell, you are in luck, for our nation’s best and brightest scientists, chemical engineers, microbiologists, and PHD-toting eggheads have put aside some time (finally!) from their — let’s face it, kind of fruitless — endeavors such as finding a cure for HIV\/AIDS, solving economic disparity, and addressing climate change, and finally tackled that age-old world issue: the irritation of changing your underwear. I introduce to you the Give-N-Go underwear from ExOficio: the world’s first underwear that does not need to be washed (very often). To you, the intrepid traveler, who asks, “Why do I need to change my underwear so often?”, ExOficio says, “Don’t!”\nThese space-age undies’ tag line, in Draper-esque fashion are: “17 countries. 6 Weeks. One pair of underwear. Okay, maybe two.” But we know they really mean one, right? A look at their package reveals what exactly these bad boys do: “[Give-N-Go’s are] high performance and low maintenance. Treated with Aegis Microbe Shield they’re odor resistant and perfect for tricky climates and active adventures.” Please, no more selling is necessary. You had me at the words “Microbe Shield.”\nAnd forget the Parisian runways, this line of underwear (and I’m not making this up) is advertised as being both “field tested and approved” by the African Wildlife Foundation, an organization you may not have realized was so intimately involved in the world of haute coutre. But let’s not take their word for it, let’s take a look at some of the (incredibly) non-anonymous customer reviews left on the underwear’s Amazon page (And for those keeping score, there were 28 five-star, one four-star, and only one one-star reviews). One very proud owner remarked, “You can live on two pairs of these — wash one at night, wear the other. Wrap it in a towel, stomp dry — should be ready in a few hours.” And here you’ve just been using your towel for your body all this time. And how about this astonished user: “Care for this item is almost too simple. I wash mine in the bathroom sink with a very small amount of detergent and hang dry for a few hours and they are ready to go again.” Oh to be that bathroom-goer lucky enough to get to use that sink right after him. (Well, at least he said he uses detergent.) And finally, where there’s a happy underwear wearer, there’s a happy mom. This from a proud mother who got her entire family in on the act: “This item was purchased for my son who was traveling to another country. He thanked me so much upon his return. He was with a group that was camping for several weeks and said this boxer brief was the most comfortable to wear, the most convenient to launder and quickest to dry. I then purchased one for another son who travels; he agrees.” It’s stories like these that get recounted during funeral eulogies and around the buffet table at wakes by bereaved children; this mother has certainly fulfilled her parental duties.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:cf33f244-213e-42f9-91db-92167a2ada02>"]},{"passage":"- Don’t take unnecessary electronics you don’t need a laptop, iPad, or anything during camping but still you need a mobile and GPS device in an emergency instead you can place a compass or navigation paper map. - Don’t bring jewelry or some good clothes you will never need jewelry or some good clothing so never overweight yourself.

As long as we wash them after each wear, they can stay in our top drawer for years, right? Wrong. Well, that’s according to the Good Housekeeping Institute (GHI) guide, which says that despite washing meticulously after use, most people’s clean underwear contains up to 10,000 living bacteria! We know – gross. So how long does underwear last? When should we be throwing our trusty undies away? How long to keep underwear\nBased on the Good Housekeeping Institute’s findings, we should be throwing out underwear every year for health reasons. These include reducing the risk of urinary tract infections, thrush and allergies. Underwear should be laundered after each wear on the hot wash setting. But despite this, an examination by the UK’s leading cleaning company, Dr Beckmann, found up to one million bacteria lurking in just two tablespoons of used washing machine water. We know. We want to go home and set light to all our old undies immediately. Ok, that might be a bit far-fetched. We don’t want to get in trouble for encouraging arson! But we do want to encourage you to think about how long you’ve hung onto your undies and have a think about whether it’s time to buy a new pair of underwear or five. Wash your tea towels separately\nIt might surprise you to learn that simple habits are helping bacteria thrive. So much so that those simple habits are actually becoming dirty habits. It’s not just our underwear we should be worried about, it’s what we’re washing with our underwear. In the GHI’s guidelines, it was also revealed that up to 90% of dirty tea towels contained E. Coli bacteria. To avoid these nasty germs, we suggest washing your tea towels and towels separately from your underwear. The GHI guidelines tell us that underwear should be changed daily, nightwear after three nights of sleep and bedding once a week. All of them should be washed at high temperatures, so to kill any nasty bacteria. Elsewhere, it was reported that pillows need to be laundered every three to six months and duvets twice a year. Washing avoiders, take note! Is your washing machine doing its job properly? So, we know that regularly washing our underwear in hot water is key to killing bacteria, dust mites and other nasty things that result in infections and allergies. But when it comes to our washing machine, how do we know it’s even doing its job correctly? Well, according to the GHI guidelines, most of the time they’re not. Here are some top tips to get the most out of each wash:\n- Wipe out the detergent drawer on your washing machine to prevent soap building up, and clean it thoroughly in hot, soapy water every few months. - Run an empty monthly service wash with hot water to rid the machine of mould and bacteria. - Check and clean the drain filters. Wipe the rubber seal with diluted bleach or vinegar to prevent the build-up of bacteria or mould. But, despite best practices when it comes to your washing machine, it’s still important to overhaul your underwear drawer each year to avoid the spread of nasty infections. Choose the right fabric\nWhile refreshing your undie drawer frequently is key to keeping you healthy, knowing how to initially choose the right underwear is just as important. Did you know that some fabrics could naturally help you keep your undies germ-free? Natural fibres such as bamboo have been found to be both antibacterial and breathable, helping you keep unwanted bacteria from developing. There’s lots of benefits to choosing bamboo over other traditional or synthetic fabrics, so why not try it out for yourself? Get started with our organically-grown bamboo underwear for him and her. Here are some options if you’re looking to update your underwear wardrobe right now.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:5890568a-53b0-4057-b8b8-e44758798882>"]},{"passage":"Many people sleep too much.

{"id":7,"doc_id":"<urn:uuid:342a6bd4-f513-4985-ac71-95113bf5a3e7>","text":"We seem to be seeing a surge in new group development lately. Many of the groups coming together are activist groups focused on political, civil rights, or social justice agendas. Other groups bring members together around special interests, or are more supportive in nature. Whatever the purpose of your group effort, I thought it might be timely to talk about the process of forming a group.\nWhile you may have thought that setting up a new group is a simple process, it might prove a bit more complicated than you thought. Group development generally involves more than just getting a group of people into the same room. All groups go through fairly predictable stages, though, so understanding those stages is a good place to start and will help you understand the process as it unfolds.\nThe popular model of group development stages created by Bruce Tuckman (1965) outlines four stages in the life of a group: 1) forming, 2) storming, 3) norming, and 4) performing. Some later permutations of this model also include a fifth stage, called alternatively “adjourning” or “mourning.” I’ll talk about each stage and the challenges that can arise, but first I think it’s important to consider what exactly you hope to accomplish with your group, and to do a little bit of preparation.\nThe first question you’ll need to answer is what it is you hope to accomplish with your group. What is your purpose? Do you have a specific project or task that needs to be completed, or a particular goal in mind? Is it intended to be a loosely organized but supportive group for members sharing a problem or concern, or does it need to be laser focused on getting a job done by deadline?\nSecondly, think about who you want to have as members. If you have a specific task to accomplish, what skills will be required, and who has the needed skills? If you are hoping to address a social problem, who else might be interested in working with you? If the group will be more supportive in nature, what is the population you want to bring into the fold?\nAlso, consider what might be the optimal size for your group. For most task-oriented groups, 6 – 12 is a workable number. Smaller groups can be effective as well, however if you have only 3 – 4 members, absences can render your group temporarily ineffective. Larger groups can also work, however they tend to require more formal organization and leadership, and it may be more difficult to harness individual creativity and foster group cohesion in a larger group. Larger groups are also more prone to forming unintended subgroups, which can promote conflict, so consider whether you really need or want a large group for your project. Bigger is not necessarily better.\nOnce you have an appropriately sized group of the right people devoted to a common cause or purpose, you are ready to begin. Set up your meeting time and place, and get to work!\nThe forming stage is the first stage of group development. This stage encompasses the first and possibly several early meetings, as group members get to know each other, exchange information and ideas, and make early decisions about how they will proceed. Usually everyone is on their best behavior at the beginning. Members are checking each other out, forming opinions about the nature of the group and what their place in it may be, and trying to make a good first impression. Early group meetings tend to be cordial and to run fairly smoothly. The important work at this stage consists of forming early relationships, delineating why you are there, and deciding how you will move forward as a group. While this stage may be pleasant, you don’t want to stay here indefinitely. If a group stalls here, it may be a signal that members don’t feel comfortable, or that there is conflict brewing that is not coming out into the open. It may also indicate that members are not strongly attached to the group’s purpose.\nThe second stage of group development–storming–involves conflict. It is at this stage that disagreements and personality conflicts start to appear, and competition for control of certain group functions arises. If you have done a good job of selecting your group members, their common purpose will help them get past this stage and move on to productive work. If not, the conflict may be more protracted. During this stage the group needs to learn how to manage their differences and cooperate towards common goals. Problems can develop if there is serious disagreement around the group’s purpose, if power struggles go unresolved, or if a single bully or a powerful subgroup sets out to impose their will on others. It is generally preferable to work through conflicts rather than ignoring or submerging them, as unresolved issues may continue to undermine the group efforts going forward.\nSome group members may believe that conflict at this stage indicates something is wrong, but it is a normal stage in group development. The important thing is that conflicts are resolved constructively.\nThe the third stage of group development is called norming. This is when the group begins to develop their way of doing things. They settle issues around what is expected of group members, who will do what, how decisions will be made, and how differences will be managed. The group may develop formal rules, but they certainly will develop informal rules, or procedures that everybody knows are there even though they may not be openly acknowledged. Groups emerging from this stage are ready to settle down to work, and their members have a pretty good idea what is expected of them. They have also learned a few things about how to work with each other successfully. Sometimes unresolved conflicts from the storming stage re-emerge, and the group is temporarily thrust back into storming until they are resolved.\nThe performing stage, the fourth stage of group development, is when most of the productive work gets done. This can be brief in a temporary group formed around specific tasks, or it can go on for a lengthy period of time. A highly productive group in which there remains agreement around purpose, and in which members are committed to working together towards their mutual goals can perform well for years. There will be challenges as old members are lost, new ones are brought into the group, and occasional conflicts are resolved. There may also be new challenges when norms require updating, however a committed group may resolve them and continue to thrive. It may seem that the group must occasionally revisit an earlier stage, but it then returns to productivity. The performing stage is the reason we form groups to begin with. It is important to note, however, that it is only one stage. It is unrealistic to expect your group to perform optimally without ever going through the other stages.\nAdjourning or Mourning\nAt some point every group comes to an end. It may be that their goals have been met and their mission accomplished. It may be that things have changed and the group no longer perceives a need to continue, or that continued performance would depend on making changes that the group members are unwilling to make. Sometimes the group makes a conscious choice to dissolve. Other times a group may just fade and become inactive over time. In some cases, the group may be dissolved involuntarily due to adverse circumstances. Regardless of how a group reaches its ending point, there may be a certain sense of loss or a period of mourning for group members. Eventually they will go their separate ways and move on to other projects. Ideally, efforts will be made to end in a positive manner, and to help group members feel good about what they have accomplished together.\nImportant Note: This blog is intended for informational and discussion purposes only, and does not substitute for professional care.

While smaller groups can be effective, having only 3-4 members can make the group temporarily ineffective when members are absent. Larger groups can also work but require more formal organization and leadership, and may face challenges with individual creativity, group cohesion, and the formation of unintended subgroups that can promote conflict.","answer":"The optimal size for most task-oriented groups can indeed vary, but a common guideline suggests that groups between 6 and 12 members are often effective for task-oriented activities. This size allows for diverse perspectives and ideas while still maintaining manageability and ensuring that everyone has a chance to contribute effectively. However, the ideal group size can depend on the specific context, including the nature of the task, the skills and personalities of the group members, and the goals of the group. For instance, smaller groups might be more effective for brainstorming or creative tasks, whereas larger groups might be better suited for tasks that require a broader range of expertise or for decision-making processes.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context:\nTypical networking activities last ½ - 2 hours.

But more about that later …\nBy the very hear-worth Podcast “Führungs auf den Punkt gebracht” by leadership coach Bernd Geropp a topic came to me, over which I wanted to blog for a long time: The ideal team size and the dangerously rising communication effort with too large teams. The magic number 7\nIn the Episode 165 of the podcast Bernd Geropp describes the ideal leadership span, i.e. the number of people that can be meaningfully led by a manager. The findings can be applied thereby not only to high-level personnel, but also and particularly with self-leading agile teams. He mentions an article of Professor Dr. Wolfgang Grunwald, work and industrial psychologist. It is shown that groups in the cultural history always consist of approx. 7 humans and larger groups inevitably fall into smaller groups. (For further background information I recommend the podcast or a Google search for the article “Psychologische Gesetzmäßigkeiten der Gruppenarbeit” [Psychological laws of group work].) I found the article and podcast so interesting because it’s more than 20 years old, but picks up on things I first learned in agile teams and UX:\nHick’s law and the magic 7\nIn UX we often speak of Hick’s Law. It describes the relationship between response time and number of choices. In short: With the number of options our reaction time increases. With about 7 options the reaction time is more than one second. This time can only be reduced by training. With UX and web designers the rule of thumb has established itself, never to offer more than 7 options e.g. in the main menu or to display at the same time. Brooks’s Law and the communication paths\nBrook’s Law by the American computer pioneer Fred Brooks states that adding more people to a delayed software project will increase the implementation time, not decrease it. [pullquote align=”right” cite=”Fred Brooks” tweet=”true”]adding human resources to a late software project makes it later[\/pullquote]\nIn addition to the difficult induction and the complex special tasks involved in software development, this is also due to the higher communication effort within the team. The non-linear growth of communication paths according to team size\nIn addition to the formula behind Hick’s Law, another formula is interesting. It describes the possible lines of communication of people, if everyone would have to coordinate with everyone:\nn × (n-1) \/ 2\nCommunication does not increase linearly with the number of people:\n- For 2 persons it is 1 connection\n- For 3 persons there are 3 connections\n- For 4 persons there are 6 connections\n- For 10 persons there are already 45 connections! (Very impressive in this context also this graphic from Stackoverflow.) If we now take our rule of thumb discovered in Hick’s Law, we have a manageable amount of communication lines somewhere with 5-7 people, depending on how many active\/extroverted participants there are. Small anecdote: I recently participated in a workshop with about 35 participants. What do you think: how many possible communication channels would that have been? I’ll tell you: 595. Agile teams and methods of communication avoidance\nCommunication avoidance sounds absurd at first. We are an agile team, we do dailies, we have product owners who manage stakeholders, we have extensive retrospectives. We should avoid communication? Yes! We’re already doing it! In the Wikipedia article on Brook’s Law there are a few limitations: His law dates back to 1975. Today, there are many things that actively avoid communication because they are convention:\n- Scrum Meetings with fixed Timebox\n- Design Patterns and Coding Guidelines, which define certain formalities at work\n- Modern practices such as Continuous Integration or Iterative development make a large part of the coordination between developers superfluous or reduce it strongly. 5 Rules for effective avoidance Communication\nOn this basis you can summarize 5 simple rules, as well as you can reduce your communication outside of agile teams and achieve more:\n- Creates standards and rules\nStandard meetings like in Scrum, email rules like: “Don’t answer when you’re in CC” or “Only answer in case of emergency”. - Shared Meetings\nPick up participants individually or in small groups. Resists the temptation to coordinate everything in a big, clarifying conversation.\n\nCreating Passion-Driven Teams\nJob Descriptions \/ Job Analysis\nThis method of Job Analysis is GREAT for creating job descriptions and it's the starting point getting people trained in a particular position. 1.

Work through all the duties, and you have a comprehensive\nduty & task list.\n\nDetails also help your teams act as a second pair of eyes for spotting potential problems down the road. The more they know about the work being done, the more help they can be to you in return. Above all, making work precise means each team member is able to complete their allotted tasks without confusion. Requirements let your teams know exactly what conditions need to be met for a task to be considered done. If you're specific enough in your task description, you may already cover the requirements of that task. However, always be sure to double check that each task lists exactly what completion looks like. There can be one requirement or several depending on the relative complexity of the task. When you set completion requirements, anyone can quickly look to see whether the job is done or not. This will help you avoid situations where your team members assume a job is done that actually isn't totally complete. The size of a task can depend on:\nYou can measure the size of a task based on any of these components, but there are certain advantages to paying attention to time, which we'll go over. Consider the following when sizing up your tasks. Obviously, it will be impossible to make your tasks completely even from all perspectives, so it's best to choose one form of measurement, and use that to dictate the size of your tasks. If you choose the length of time required to complete a task, you'll need to split all of your tasks into similarly sized time periods (e.g. ¬Ω a day or 1 day's worth of work.) To do this, you will need to split oversized tasks into smaller pieces and group smaller tasks into batches. Dividing tasks into equal amounts of work by time makes it easier to:\nAs with most recommendations we make in this guide, it will be up to you to decide what the best way of dividing your tasks up is. There's no “correct” size for tasks, but here are a few considerations to think about before making your decision:\nPro Tip: Think about how your team feels about their work. Aside from the logistical advantages to grouping your tasks into ¬Ω day or 1 day chunks, there's also a psychological advantage. When you make tasks that are achievable in a half a day or a day, your team members are able to check off at least one task per workday, giving them a sense of accomplishment each and every day they walk out of the office. By setting an assignee to every task, you attach clear responsibility to every piece of work within your project. Assigning every task is also important for transparency. Without an assignee, you‚Äîthe Project Manager‚Äîmight know the status of the task or perhaps a few members of one team, but other team members, teams, and stakeholders will not easily be able to tell the status of an unassigned task which compromises their ability to understand the progress of the project as a whole. Pro Tip: Focus on what matters. You can set a number of parameters for tasks, but the assignee and due date are the most important. As a rule of thumb, unless you have significant reason not to, always set an assignee and due date for every task. The assignee of a task acts as the point person for the work being done. Should someone have a question about that work, they should feel confident in turning to the assignee for answers. When thinking of who would be best for a task, it's important to get to know your team's strengths, weaknesses, and skills. Over time, you'll learn which types of tasks are done best by which team members, and your projects will run more efficiently. Pro Tip: Don't leave anything unassigned. If there is no appropriate person to assign a task yet, or you are the only person fully aware of every aspect of the task, assign it to yourself‚Äîeven if it's just temporarily. There may be projects where tasks require two or more team members to collaborate. It's still best to select one assignee who will act as the supervisor to that task. When multiple people are assigned to the same task, one of two mistakes can easily happen: multiple people do some of the same work or multiple people neglect a piece of the same work. When collaborating on single tasks, there are a few ways to ensure proper collaboration and communication. Pro Tip: Distribute tasks fairly, and play to your team's strengths. You'll want to ensure that each member of your teams have realistic and fair workloads.\n\nDifference between revisions of \"TeamUp\"\n(→Perfect repartition is not always possible)\n(→Perfect repartition is not always possible)\n|Line 148:||Line 148:|\n== Perfect repartition is not always possible ==\n== Perfect repartition is not always possible ==\nNote that, depending on student responses, it may happen that no group composition is perfectly optimal.

Manual adaptations can sometimes help to balance groups, but in some cases it is impossible to make all to be validated. Then save a partially optimal composition or possibly test another composition with less restrictive criteria. Revision as of 23:36, 7 June 2019\nDo you dream of composing groups on the basis of criteria, such as gathering students on the basis of their preference for work topics or mixing students according to their orientation ? The TeamUp activity allows the teacher to define a questionnaire and to compose groups, taking into account student responses. The TeamUp activity first enables you to compose a questionnaire with multiple choice questions with possibility of restrictions on the answers .For example, it is possible to require the student to tick exactly 2 options from the list of available options. The questionnaire is available to students on the opening date and they can respond to it. As soon as the closing date has passed, the teacher can start the group composition using four approaches :\n- group similar individuals;\n- disperse similar individuals;\n- avoid minorities ;\n- balance the skill level (based on a question with numerical options). Several criteria can be combined to compose the groups and the tool provides a diagnosis on the number of optimal groups. - 1 Create a TeamUp activity\n- 2 Create a questionnaire with distribution criteria\n- 3 Publish the questionnaire and collect student responses\n- 4 Generate groups\n- 5 Perfect repartition is not always possible\nCreate a TeamUp activity\n- a name and an introduction to the activity to present this activity;\n- an opening date from which students will be able to answer the questionnaire (as a result, the questions then can not be modified when this date is passed);\n- a closing date from which student responses will no longer be allowed;\n- the parameter \"Allow updating of answers\" specifies whether you allow students to modify their answers during the opening period of the questionnaire;\nCreate a questionnaire with distribution criteria\nGo to the Questionnaire tab to build the multiple-choice questions that will allow students to provide useful information for group composition. Type your question and define the associated restrictions on the possible answers :\n- none : the student can select any number of options, or none at all;\n- at least one check mark : the student must select at least one option;\n- exactly 1 check mark : the student must select one and only one option;\n- exactly 2 check marks : the student must select exactly 2 options;\n- exactly 3 check marks : the student must select exactly 3 options. When your questionnaire is finalized, you can preview it via the Preview Questions tab . For example, your questions may include the time range for student availability for group meetings (to group them), their curriculum (to mix), their gender (to avoid minorities), their preference thematic (to group them), on their average score over the past year exam (to balance the level of the groups), ... If you want your students to select several options from a list, for example to choose a discussions theme, we advise you to avoid questions that require you to make hierarchical choices (first choice, second choice, ... ). This type of question has two disadvantages :\n- we can not prevent a student from making the same choice 3 times and the algorithm can only attribute this choice to him;\n- the criteria based on hierarchical choices are very restrictive for the distribution algorithm, so that optimal groups are difficult to obtain and, therefore, an unfair distribution for the students. Publish the questionnaire and collect student responses\nWhen your questionnaire is ready, you can change its opening date to make it accessible to students. Do not hesitate to invite your students to answer the questionnaire by using the Moodle Annoucements. You will be able to observe the answers evolution via the Compose groups tab : the students who answered are shown in blue while the students who have not yet responded are displayed in red . If some students do not answer the questionnaire, it do not block the groups composition. They are then randomly placed to complete the groups and you can also move them manually.\n\nI completely agree with Woody. When classes are too large you end up with\ndays where it seems every child needs help and you end up with not enough\ntime to help them. Ideally, I have appx. 2 1\/2 minutes per student (high\nschool level) - every student won't need help every day, but this seems to\nbe a nice number (20-23). BUT numbers are relevant - a class of 11 of the\nright mix of students and the class ends up being more like \"40\" (our first\ngrade is like this this year - only 17 of them, but they are a mighty 17! Full of strong personalities!). On the other hand, a class of 11 highly\nmotivated students can allow you to try projects you might not otherwise - I\ndid the tape sculptures last year when my class was small, and they were\nawesome!

It’s not that larger groups are somehow less secure, it’s just that 150 is the cognitive limit to the number of people a human brain can maintain a coherent social relationship with. Primatologist Robin Dunbar derived this number by comparing neocortex — the “thinking” part of the mammalian brain — volume with the size of primate social groups. By analyzing data from 38 primate genera and extrapolating to the human neocortex size, he predicted a human “mean group size” of roughly 150. This number appears regularly in human society; it’s the estimated size of a Neolithic farming village, the size at which Hittite settlements split, and the basic unit in professional armies from Roman times to the present day. Larger group sizes aren’t as stable because their members don’t know each other well enough. Instead of thinking of the members as people, we think of them as groups of people. For such groups to function well, they need externally imposed structure, such as name badges. Of course, badges aren’t the only way to determine in-group\/out-group status. Other markers include insignia, uniforms, and secret handshakes. They have different security properties and some make more sense than others at different levels of technology, but once a group reaches 150 people, it has to do something. More generally, there are several layers of natural human group size that increase with a ratio of approximately three: 5, 15, 50, 150, 500, and 1500 — although, really, the numbers aren’t as precise as all that, and groups that are less focused on survival tend to be smaller. The layers relate to both the intensity and intimacy of relationship and the frequency of contact. The smallest, three to five, is a “clique”: the number of people from whom you would seek help in times of severe emotional distress. The twelve to 20 group is the “sympathy group”: people with which you have special ties. After that, 30 to 50 is the typical size of hunter-gatherer overnight camps, generally drawn from the same pool of 150 people. No matter what size company you work for, there are only about 150 people you consider to be “co-workers.” (In small companies, Alice and Bob handle accounting. In larger companies, it’s the accounting department — and maybe you know someone there personally.) The 500-person group is the “megaband,” and the 1,500-person group is the “tribe.” Fifteen hundred is roughly the number of faces we can put names to, and the typical size of a hunter-gatherer society. These numbers are reflected in military organization throughout history: squads of 10 to 15 organized into platoons of three to four squads, organized into companies of three to four platoons, organized into battalions of three to four companies, organized into regiments of three to four battalions, organized into divisions of two to three regiments, and organized into corps of two to three divisions. Coherence can become a real problem once organizations get above about 150 in size. So as group sizes grow across these boundaries, they have more externally imposed infrastructure — and more formalized security systems. In intimate groups, pretty much all security is ad hoc. Companies smaller than 150 don’t bother with name badges; companies greater than 500 hire a guard to sit in the lobby and check badges. The military have had centuries of experience with this under rather trying circumstances, but even there the real commitment and bonding invariably occurs at the company level. Above that you need to have rank imposed by discipline. The whole brain-size comparison might be bunk, and a lot of evolutionary psychologists disagree with it. But certainly security systems become more formalized as groups grow larger and their members less known to each other. When do more formal dispute resolution systems arise: town elders, magistrates, judges? At what size boundary are formal authentication schemes required? Small companies can get by without the internal forms, memos, and procedures that large companies require; when does what tend to appear? How does punishment formalize as group size increase? And how do all these things affect group coherence? People act differently on social networking sites like Facebook when their list of “friends” grows larger and less intimate.\n\nI’ve mentioned in several blog entries that I am a member of a Mastermind Group, and people often ask me a variety of questions about how my meeting is structured and run. Since I think Mastermind Groups are a wonderful tool for personal growth and connection, I’d like to share some of the details about how my group works which will help you form and run your own group. In essence, a Mastermind Group is a group that helps you become a vibrational match for your goals or your intentions. The belief is that your group members know you so well, they can tell when you are not really a vibrational match for your desire, so they will help you locate blocks or help you craft an intention that is in alignment with who you are and what you want. How many people are in the group? My group has 6 members. Sometimes someone takes a break for a few months if their schedule gets too full, if they’re traveling, or if they just need a break. Sometimes a member will bring a guest to a meeting to see if they are a good fit for the group. We generally have the guest come to a few meetings so we can get a feel for her and for her to decide if joining our group is something she’s really interested in. But generally speaking, we keep the number at 6 or 7. The number of people in the Mastermind is really up to each group, but I think 5-7 people is ideal. If the group is too big you can sometimes lose the intimate connection as people split into cliques or sub groups. Or your meetings can take 2 hours. If the group is too small you don’t get the wisdom of a larger collective, and if people are absent you could be at your meeting with just one other person. How often do you meet? My group meets every other week. Even if someone can’t make the meeting, we don’t try to find a day when everyone can make it. We stick to our schedule and whoever can come, comes. Most of the time, every member is present. It works best that way if the members are committed to attending every meeting. I think meeting once a month is not quite enough because a lot can happen in a month and if you miss even one meeting then you’re really going long without your supportive group. Meeting weekly is also a good option if everyone is comfortable meeting that often. How long are your meetings? We meet for one hour, however we have learned to reserve some time after our meeting for chatting about other things going on in our lives. During the meeting, we are all business, otherwise it’s easy to get sidetracked. Sometimes a member is going through a personal crisis, but we honor our meeting structure and then spend time after the meeting helping her with practical solutions to her problem. Is your group for women only? We tested out having men in our group but decided it changed the energy and dynamic too much, so now we’re a woman-only group. You can specify a gender or invite anyone. It all depends on what kind of energy you want to create and how compatible everyone is with each other. Compatible energy is more important than gender. Where do you meet? Our group meets at the home of one of our members. You can meet in a conference room, a park, a restaurant, or really anywhere that you can ensure privacy, because you need to be able to be emotionally intimate with your members. You can rotate the home in which you have your meetings to make it fair for everyone. How do you find members? Adding new members to my group usually happens when one of us brings a friend who we think would be interested in joining and also be a good fit for our other members. I think it’s vital that you don’t add new members if someone who is already in the group opposes the addition of a new member for whatever reason. There is a great deal of trust involved in having a Mastermind Group and if someone would feel uncomfortable with the addition of another member then it’s not worth adding the new person. If you’re just starting out, I recommend picking people who share a similar vibration to you. Perhaps a close friend. But just because someone is your friend doesn’t mean they will be a good member of a Mastermind Group. To function well, members should be emotionally mature, respect confidential personal information you may discuss at meetings, be reasonably intelligent, and kind. Pick other attributes as best suits your group’s intention (i.e. business minded, other parents, women only, etc.). What happens at the meetings themselves? We start our meetings by reading our Declarations For Mastermind which is simply a list of our group’s goals and guidelines.\n\nConducting a Table Top Job Analysis\nThink of a Table Top Job Analysis (TTJA) as a systematically-organized brainstorm. This process can be used for three purposes:\n- Create a list of duties for a job. - Create a list of tasks needed to perform each duty. - Identifying the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed for each task. Here’s how the process works:\n- Gather a group of “experts” for a particular job. - Have each expert make their own list of that they believe the duties to be. - Starting with one person, have him\/her read out loud one of the identified duties. - Others in the group will likely have that duty, as well. - As a group, decide if it is a duty or a task that fits into a larger duty. - If others have that duty on their list, come to consensus on the best wording for the duty. - Write the duty in large letters on an 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper, and tape it to the wall. - Everyone crosses that duty off their list. - Move on to the next person, have him\/her read off another duty. Repeat step 4. - Continue around the room until everyone has provided a duty, then start over with the first person again and keep going around the room until everyone’s list is exhausted. - There should be between five and fourteen duties on the wall. If more than fourteen exist, look at how some of the duties could be combined so that no more than fourteen exist. - If there are less than five, it may be that some duties have been defined too broadly. Consider which ones may be too comprehensive and break them down, if needed. - Prioritize the duties by starting with three groups:\n- Which are the highest priority duties? Move those to one side of the wall. - Which are the lowest priority duties? Move those to the other side of the wall. - Now that three groups exist, prioritize the duties in each group. This gives you an overall priority list. - Take each duty and repeat the Nominal Group Technique to determine each set of tasks. Instead of prioritizing each completed list, order them for optimal efficiency to perform the duty. Repeat the process, but take each task and brainstorm the necessary knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed to accomplish each task. Instead of prioritizing the KSA’s place them in the most appropriate order for people to learn how to perform each task.\n\nAnother issue of an occasional series—Dear Adrian—in which I answer questions about event design, elementary particle physics, solar hot water systems, facilitation, and anything else I might conceivably know something about. If you have a question you’d like me to answer, please contact me (don’t worry, I won’t publish anything without your permission). Here’s a great question from Australian facilitator, trainer, and coach Steve Rohan-Jones about … The Three Questions! (Check out the link if you aren’t already familiar with The Three Questions, otherwise what you are about to read won’t make much sense.) Good morning from Canberra, Adrian,\nI have just read through The Power of Participation over one year after I received a signed copy from you! In short, I have a question about The Three Questions. I understand the process both in singular and multiple form (combined with round tables). From my reading, The Three Questions appears to take some time (based on the amount of participants) with only one person speaking. This appears at odds with the aim to get people engaged in conversation. I would also think – not a question just an observation – that group of 6 would be better. This would speed up the set piece of one person speaking and others listening, reduce the need for breaks and keep the energy going early in the day. Can you clarify my understanding of The Three Questions? I look forward to hearing from you. O2C Pty Ltd\nSteve, I like your question because it highlights a key tension inherent in group process design: the tension between intimacy (going deep with a few) and discovery (uncovering the possibilities of the many). Let’s explore this in more detail. When people are meeting for a shared purpose, some of the potentially valuable outcomes include:\n- Learning about each other. - Being and feeling heard. - Sharing with each other. - Learning from each other. The Three Questions focuses on #1, #2, and #3. I love to use it at the start of an event or workshop, because we can’t really learn effectively from our peers (#4) until we:\n- have learnt what they might have to offer (#1);\n- feel safe sharing with them (#2); and\n- have each had an opportunity to share our own expertise and experience (#3). Because each person gets the same amount of time to share their answers to The Three Questions to a group, the time needed to run the process is proportional to the group’s size. [I’m neglecting here the few minutes needed to a) explain the process and b) provide one or two short breaks for large groups.] In practice, I’ve found this restricts the maximum effective size of a single group using The Three Questions to 60 people. If more than 60 people are present, you divide them into smaller groups and run multiple simultaneous The Three Questions sessions. Even if we have 60 people or less, we may still decide to divide our group into several smaller groups and run multiple simultaneous sessions. Typically we’ll do this when time is a constraint. For example, next month I’m leading a two-hour, ~200 person, participation techniques workshop. In order to cover multiple core techniques in two hours with this many participants, I will give them just a taste of The Three Questions by running 30+ concurrent 6-person groups. Everyone will know five former strangers much better after the ~20 minute session is over, but they won’t have learned more about the others in the room. So when designing a session or conference that includes The Three Questions, there is a trade-off between the time we have or want to allocate and group size, because we need to give each person sufficient time for meaningful sharing with their group (typically 1 – 2 minutes per person). There’s no single answer for this design decision that’s optimum for all circumstances. At a multi-day conference, for example, it makes sense to run multiple simultaneous 50-60 person Three Questions groups for a couple of hours at the start of the event. Everyone in each group will learn important information about the interests and resources of their 50-60 peers. For a monthly board meeting, once a year I might run a single session with the ten board members to remind the group of each member’s “why?”. And at a one-day peer conference with ninety participants, perhaps three simultaneous 30-person sessions would be the way to go. In some ways this design consideration is a parallel application of Jerry Weinberg’s Law of Raspberry Jam:\nThe wider you spread it, the thinner it gets.","passages":[{"passage":"Typical networking activities last ½ - 2 hours.

But more about that later …\nBy the very hear-worth Podcast “Führungs auf den Punkt gebracht” by leadership coach Bernd Geropp a topic came to me, over which I wanted to blog for a long time: The ideal team size and the dangerously rising communication effort with too large teams. The magic number 7\nIn the Episode 165 of the podcast Bernd Geropp describes the ideal leadership span, i.e. the number of people that can be meaningfully led by a manager. The findings can be applied thereby not only to high-level personnel, but also and particularly with self-leading agile teams. He mentions an article of Professor Dr. Wolfgang Grunwald, work and industrial psychologist. It is shown that groups in the cultural history always consist of approx. 7 humans and larger groups inevitably fall into smaller groups. (For further background information I recommend the podcast or a Google search for the article “Psychologische Gesetzmäßigkeiten der Gruppenarbeit” [Psychological laws of group work].) I found the article and podcast so interesting because it’s more than 20 years old, but picks up on things I first learned in agile teams and UX:\nHick’s law and the magic 7\nIn UX we often speak of Hick’s Law. It describes the relationship between response time and number of choices. In short: With the number of options our reaction time increases. With about 7 options the reaction time is more than one second. This time can only be reduced by training. With UX and web designers the rule of thumb has established itself, never to offer more than 7 options e.g. in the main menu or to display at the same time. Brooks’s Law and the communication paths\nBrook’s Law by the American computer pioneer Fred Brooks states that adding more people to a delayed software project will increase the implementation time, not decrease it. [pullquote align=”right” cite=”Fred Brooks” tweet=”true”]adding human resources to a late software project makes it later[\/pullquote]\nIn addition to the difficult induction and the complex special tasks involved in software development, this is also due to the higher communication effort within the team. The non-linear growth of communication paths according to team size\nIn addition to the formula behind Hick’s Law, another formula is interesting. It describes the possible lines of communication of people, if everyone would have to coordinate with everyone:\nn × (n-1) \/ 2\nCommunication does not increase linearly with the number of people:\n- For 2 persons it is 1 connection\n- For 3 persons there are 3 connections\n- For 4 persons there are 6 connections\n- For 10 persons there are already 45 connections! (Very impressive in this context also this graphic from Stackoverflow.) If we now take our rule of thumb discovered in Hick’s Law, we have a manageable amount of communication lines somewhere with 5-7 people, depending on how many active\/extroverted participants there are. Small anecdote: I recently participated in a workshop with about 35 participants. What do you think: how many possible communication channels would that have been? I’ll tell you: 595. Agile teams and methods of communication avoidance\nCommunication avoidance sounds absurd at first. We are an agile team, we do dailies, we have product owners who manage stakeholders, we have extensive retrospectives. We should avoid communication? Yes! We’re already doing it! In the Wikipedia article on Brook’s Law there are a few limitations: His law dates back to 1975. Today, there are many things that actively avoid communication because they are convention:\n- Scrum Meetings with fixed Timebox\n- Design Patterns and Coding Guidelines, which define certain formalities at work\n- Modern practices such as Continuous Integration or Iterative development make a large part of the coordination between developers superfluous or reduce it strongly. 5 Rules for effective avoidance Communication\nOn this basis you can summarize 5 simple rules, as well as you can reduce your communication outside of agile teams and achieve more:\n- Creates standards and rules\nStandard meetings like in Scrum, email rules like: “Don’t answer when you’re in CC” or “Only answer in case of emergency”. - Shared Meetings\nPick up participants individually or in small groups.

The more they know about the work being done, the more help they can be to you in return. Above all, making work precise means each team member is able to complete their allotted tasks without confusion. Requirements let your teams know exactly what conditions need to be met for a task to be considered done. If you're specific enough in your task description, you may already cover the requirements of that task. However, always be sure to double check that each task lists exactly what completion looks like. There can be one requirement or several depending on the relative complexity of the task. When you set completion requirements, anyone can quickly look to see whether the job is done or not. This will help you avoid situations where your team members assume a job is done that actually isn't totally complete. The size of a task can depend on:\nYou can measure the size of a task based on any of these components, but there are certain advantages to paying attention to time, which we'll go over. Consider the following when sizing up your tasks. Obviously, it will be impossible to make your tasks completely even from all perspectives, so it's best to choose one form of measurement, and use that to dictate the size of your tasks. If you choose the length of time required to complete a task, you'll need to split all of your tasks into similarly sized time periods (e.g. ¬Ω a day or 1 day's worth of work.) To do this, you will need to split oversized tasks into smaller pieces and group smaller tasks into batches. Dividing tasks into equal amounts of work by time makes it easier to:\nAs with most recommendations we make in this guide, it will be up to you to decide what the best way of dividing your tasks up is. There's no “correct” size for tasks, but here are a few considerations to think about before making your decision:\nPro Tip: Think about how your team feels about their work. Aside from the logistical advantages to grouping your tasks into ¬Ω day or 1 day chunks, there's also a psychological advantage. When you make tasks that are achievable in a half a day or a day, your team members are able to check off at least one task per workday, giving them a sense of accomplishment each and every day they walk out of the office. By setting an assignee to every task, you attach clear responsibility to every piece of work within your project. Assigning every task is also important for transparency. Without an assignee, you‚Äîthe Project Manager‚Äîmight know the status of the task or perhaps a few members of one team, but other team members, teams, and stakeholders will not easily be able to tell the status of an unassigned task which compromises their ability to understand the progress of the project as a whole. Pro Tip: Focus on what matters. You can set a number of parameters for tasks, but the assignee and due date are the most important. As a rule of thumb, unless you have significant reason not to, always set an assignee and due date for every task. The assignee of a task acts as the point person for the work being done. Should someone have a question about that work, they should feel confident in turning to the assignee for answers. When thinking of who would be best for a task, it's important to get to know your team's strengths, weaknesses, and skills. Over time, you'll learn which types of tasks are done best by which team members, and your projects will run more efficiently. Pro Tip: Don't leave anything unassigned. If there is no appropriate person to assign a task yet, or you are the only person fully aware of every aspect of the task, assign it to yourself‚Äîeven if it's just temporarily. There may be projects where tasks require two or more team members to collaborate. It's still best to select one assignee who will act as the supervisor to that task. When multiple people are assigned to the same task, one of two mistakes can easily happen: multiple people do some of the same work or multiple people neglect a piece of the same work. When collaborating on single tasks, there are a few ways to ensure proper collaboration and communication. Pro Tip: Distribute tasks fairly, and play to your team's strengths. You'll want to ensure that each member of your teams have realistic and fair workloads.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:7b222247-6212-4c03-b74f-e07fa5bab293>"]},{"passage":"Difference between revisions of \"TeamUp\"\n(→Perfect repartition is not always possible)\n(→Perfect repartition is not always possible)\n|Line 148:||Line 148:|\n== Perfect repartition is not always possible ==\n== Perfect repartition is not always possible ==\nNote that, depending on student responses, it may happen that no group composition is perfectly optimal.

Manual adaptations can sometimes help to balance groups, but in some cases it is impossible to make all to be validated. Then save a partially optimal composition or possibly test another composition with less restrictive criteria. Revision as of 23:36, 7 June 2019\nDo you dream of composing groups on the basis of criteria, such as gathering students on the basis of their preference for work topics or mixing students according to their orientation ? The TeamUp activity allows the teacher to define a questionnaire and to compose groups, taking into account student responses. The TeamUp activity first enables you to compose a questionnaire with multiple choice questions with possibility of restrictions on the answers .For example, it is possible to require the student to tick exactly 2 options from the list of available options. The questionnaire is available to students on the opening date and they can respond to it. As soon as the closing date has passed, the teacher can start the group composition using four approaches :\n- group similar individuals;\n- disperse similar individuals;\n- avoid minorities ;\n- balance the skill level (based on a question with numerical options). Several criteria can be combined to compose the groups and the tool provides a diagnosis on the number of optimal groups. - 1 Create a TeamUp activity\n- 2 Create a questionnaire with distribution criteria\n- 3 Publish the questionnaire and collect student responses\n- 4 Generate groups\n- 5 Perfect repartition is not always possible\nCreate a TeamUp activity\n- a name and an introduction to the activity to present this activity;\n- an opening date from which students will be able to answer the questionnaire (as a result, the questions then can not be modified when this date is passed);\n- a closing date from which student responses will no longer be allowed;\n- the parameter \"Allow updating of answers\" specifies whether you allow students to modify their answers during the opening period of the questionnaire;\nCreate a questionnaire with distribution criteria\nGo to the Questionnaire tab to build the multiple-choice questions that will allow students to provide useful information for group composition. Type your question and define the associated restrictions on the possible answers :\n- none : the student can select any number of options, or none at all;\n- at least one check mark : the student must select at least one option;\n- exactly 1 check mark : the student must select one and only one option;\n- exactly 2 check marks : the student must select exactly 2 options;\n- exactly 3 check marks : the student must select exactly 3 options. When your questionnaire is finalized, you can preview it via the Preview Questions tab . For example, your questions may include the time range for student availability for group meetings (to group them), their curriculum (to mix), their gender (to avoid minorities), their preference thematic (to group them), on their average score over the past year exam (to balance the level of the groups), ... If you want your students to select several options from a list, for example to choose a discussions theme, we advise you to avoid questions that require you to make hierarchical choices (first choice, second choice, ... ). This type of question has two disadvantages :\n- we can not prevent a student from making the same choice 3 times and the algorithm can only attribute this choice to him;\n- the criteria based on hierarchical choices are very restrictive for the distribution algorithm, so that optimal groups are difficult to obtain and, therefore, an unfair distribution for the students. Publish the questionnaire and collect student responses\nWhen your questionnaire is ready, you can change its opening date to make it accessible to students. Do not hesitate to invite your students to answer the questionnaire by using the Moodle Annoucements. You will be able to observe the answers evolution via the Compose groups tab : the students who answered are shown in blue while the students who have not yet responded are displayed in red . If some students do not answer the questionnaire, it do not block the groups composition. They are then randomly placed to complete the groups and you can also move them manually.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:b7547913-b9d3-45cd-a542-4dd476d41409>"]},{"passage":"I completely agree with Woody.

It’s not that larger groups are somehow less secure, it’s just that 150 is the cognitive limit to the number of people a human brain can maintain a coherent social relationship with. Primatologist Robin Dunbar derived this number by comparing neocortex — the “thinking” part of the mammalian brain — volume with the size of primate social groups. By analyzing data from 38 primate genera and extrapolating to the human neocortex size, he predicted a human “mean group size” of roughly 150. This number appears regularly in human society; it’s the estimated size of a Neolithic farming village, the size at which Hittite settlements split, and the basic unit in professional armies from Roman times to the present day. Larger group sizes aren’t as stable because their members don’t know each other well enough. Instead of thinking of the members as people, we think of them as groups of people. For such groups to function well, they need externally imposed structure, such as name badges. Of course, badges aren’t the only way to determine in-group\/out-group status. Other markers include insignia, uniforms, and secret handshakes. They have different security properties and some make more sense than others at different levels of technology, but once a group reaches 150 people, it has to do something. More generally, there are several layers of natural human group size that increase with a ratio of approximately three: 5, 15, 50, 150, 500, and 1500 — although, really, the numbers aren’t as precise as all that, and groups that are less focused on survival tend to be smaller. The layers relate to both the intensity and intimacy of relationship and the frequency of contact. The smallest, three to five, is a “clique”: the number of people from whom you would seek help in times of severe emotional distress. The twelve to 20 group is the “sympathy group”: people with which you have special ties. After that, 30 to 50 is the typical size of hunter-gatherer overnight camps, generally drawn from the same pool of 150 people. No matter what size company you work for, there are only about 150 people you consider to be “co-workers.” (In small companies, Alice and Bob handle accounting. In larger companies, it’s the accounting department — and maybe you know someone there personally.) The 500-person group is the “megaband,” and the 1,500-person group is the “tribe.” Fifteen hundred is roughly the number of faces we can put names to, and the typical size of a hunter-gatherer society. These numbers are reflected in military organization throughout history: squads of 10 to 15 organized into platoons of three to four squads, organized into companies of three to four platoons, organized into battalions of three to four companies, organized into regiments of three to four battalions, organized into divisions of two to three regiments, and organized into corps of two to three divisions. Coherence can become a real problem once organizations get above about 150 in size. So as group sizes grow across these boundaries, they have more externally imposed infrastructure — and more formalized security systems. In intimate groups, pretty much all security is ad hoc. Companies smaller than 150 don’t bother with name badges; companies greater than 500 hire a guard to sit in the lobby and check badges. The military have had centuries of experience with this under rather trying circumstances, but even there the real commitment and bonding invariably occurs at the company level. Above that you need to have rank imposed by discipline. The whole brain-size comparison might be bunk, and a lot of evolutionary psychologists disagree with it. But certainly security systems become more formalized as groups grow larger and their members less known to each other. When do more formal dispute resolution systems arise: town elders, magistrates, judges? At what size boundary are formal authentication schemes required? Small companies can get by without the internal forms, memos, and procedures that large companies require; when does what tend to appear? How does punishment formalize as group size increase? And how do all these things affect group coherence? People act differently on social networking sites like Facebook when their list of “friends” grows larger and less intimate.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:665b930c-8f12-4762-9d6a-71bb33173374>"]},{"passage":"I’ve mentioned in several blog entries that I am a member of a Mastermind Group, and people often ask me a variety of questions about how my meeting is structured and run. Since I think Mastermind Groups are a wonderful tool for personal growth and connection, I’d like to share some of the details about how my group works which will help you form and run your own group. In essence, a Mastermind Group is a group that helps you become a vibrational match for your goals or your intentions. The belief is that your group members know you so well, they can tell when you are not really a vibrational match for your desire, so they will help you locate blocks or help you craft an intention that is in alignment with who you are and what you want. How many people are in the group? My group has 6 members. Sometimes someone takes a break for a few months if their schedule gets too full, if they’re traveling, or if they just need a break. Sometimes a member will bring a guest to a meeting to see if they are a good fit for the group. We generally have the guest come to a few meetings so we can get a feel for her and for her to decide if joining our group is something she’s really interested in. But generally speaking, we keep the number at 6 or 7. The number of people in the Mastermind is really up to each group, but I think 5-7 people is ideal. If the group is too big you can sometimes lose the intimate connection as people split into cliques or sub groups. Or your meetings can take 2 hours. If the group is too small you don’t get the wisdom of a larger collective, and if people are absent you could be at your meeting with just one other person. How often do you meet? My group meets every other week. Even if someone can’t make the meeting, we don’t try to find a day when everyone can make it. We stick to our schedule and whoever can come, comes. Most of the time, every member is present. It works best that way if the members are committed to attending every meeting. I think meeting once a month is not quite enough because a lot can happen in a month and if you miss even one meeting then you’re really going long without your supportive group. Meeting weekly is also a good option if everyone is comfortable meeting that often. How long are your meetings? We meet for one hour, however we have learned to reserve some time after our meeting for chatting about other things going on in our lives. During the meeting, we are all business, otherwise it’s easy to get sidetracked. Sometimes a member is going through a personal crisis, but we honor our meeting structure and then spend time after the meeting helping her with practical solutions to her problem. Is your group for women only? We tested out having men in our group but decided it changed the energy and dynamic too much, so now we’re a woman-only group. You can specify a gender or invite anyone. It all depends on what kind of energy you want to create and how compatible everyone is with each other. Compatible energy is more important than gender. Where do you meet? Our group meets at the home of one of our members. You can meet in a conference room, a park, a restaurant, or really anywhere that you can ensure privacy, because you need to be able to be emotionally intimate with your members. You can rotate the home in which you have your meetings to make it fair for everyone. How do you find members? Adding new members to my group usually happens when one of us brings a friend who we think would be interested in joining and also be a good fit for our other members. I think it’s vital that you don’t add new members if someone who is already in the group opposes the addition of a new member for whatever reason. There is a great deal of trust involved in having a Mastermind Group and if someone would feel uncomfortable with the addition of another member then it’s not worth adding the new person. If you’re just starting out, I recommend picking people who share a similar vibration to you. Perhaps a close friend. But just because someone is your friend doesn’t mean they will be a good member of a Mastermind Group. To function well, members should be emotionally mature, respect confidential personal information you may discuss at meetings, be reasonably intelligent, and kind. Pick other attributes as best suits your group’s intention (i.e. business minded, other parents, women only, etc.). What happens at the meetings themselves? We start our meetings by reading our Declarations For Mastermind which is simply a list of our group’s goals and guidelines.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:1d39addb-a557-46b4-8dfd-8c87ec1567f6>"]},{"passage":"Conducting a Table Top Job Analysis\nThink of a Table Top Job Analysis (TTJA) as a systematically-organized brainstorm. This process can be used for three purposes:\n- Create a list of duties for a job. - Create a list of tasks needed to perform each duty. - Identifying the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed for each task. Here’s how the process works:\n- Gather a group of “experts” for a particular job. - Have each expert make their own list of that they believe the duties to be. - Starting with one person, have him\/her read out loud one of the identified duties. - Others in the group will likely have that duty, as well. - As a group, decide if it is a duty or a task that fits into a larger duty. - If others have that duty on their list, come to consensus on the best wording for the duty. - Write the duty in large letters on an 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper, and tape it to the wall. - Everyone crosses that duty off their list. - Move on to the next person, have him\/her read off another duty. Repeat step 4. - Continue around the room until everyone has provided a duty, then start over with the first person again and keep going around the room until everyone’s list is exhausted. - There should be between five and fourteen duties on the wall.

Instead of prioritizing each completed list, order them for optimal efficiency to perform the duty.

If you have a question you’d like me to answer, please contact me (don’t worry, I won’t publish anything without your permission). Here’s a great question from Australian facilitator, trainer, and coach Steve Rohan-Jones about … The Three Questions! (Check out the link if you aren’t already familiar with The Three Questions, otherwise what you are about to read won’t make much sense.) Good morning from Canberra, Adrian,\nI have just read through The Power of Participation over one year after I received a signed copy from you! In short, I have a question about The Three Questions. I understand the process both in singular and multiple form (combined with round tables). From my reading, The Three Questions appears to take some time (based on the amount of participants) with only one person speaking. This appears at odds with the aim to get people engaged in conversation. I would also think – not a question just an observation – that group of 6 would be better. This would speed up the set piece of one person speaking and others listening, reduce the need for breaks and keep the energy going early in the day. Can you clarify my understanding of The Three Questions? I look forward to hearing from you. O2C Pty Ltd\nSteve, I like your question because it highlights a key tension inherent in group process design: the tension between intimacy (going deep with a few) and discovery (uncovering the possibilities of the many). Let’s explore this in more detail. When people are meeting for a shared purpose, some of the potentially valuable outcomes include:\n- Learning about each other. - Being and feeling heard. - Sharing with each other. - Learning from each other. The Three Questions focuses on #1, #2, and #3. I love to use it at the start of an event or workshop, because we can’t really learn effectively from our peers (#4) until we:\n- have learnt what they might have to offer (#1);\n- feel safe sharing with them (#2); and\n- have each had an opportunity to share our own expertise and experience (#3). Because each person gets the same amount of time to share their answers to The Three Questions to a group, the time needed to run the process is proportional to the group’s size. [I’m neglecting here the few minutes needed to a) explain the process and b) provide one or two short breaks for large groups.] In practice, I’ve found this restricts the maximum effective size of a single group using The Three Questions to 60 people. If more than 60 people are present, you divide them into smaller groups and run multiple simultaneous The Three Questions sessions. Even if we have 60 people or less, we may still decide to divide our group into several smaller groups and run multiple simultaneous sessions. Typically we’ll do this when time is a constraint. For example, next month I’m leading a two-hour, ~200 person, participation techniques workshop. In order to cover multiple core techniques in two hours with this many participants, I will give them just a taste of The Three Questions by running 30+ concurrent 6-person groups. Everyone will know five former strangers much better after the ~20 minute session is over, but they won’t have learned more about the others in the room. So when designing a session or conference that includes The Three Questions, there is a trade-off between the time we have or want to allocate and group size, because we need to give each person sufficient time for meaningful sharing with their group (typically 1 – 2 minutes per person). There’s no single answer for this design decision that’s optimum for all circumstances. At a multi-day conference, for example, it makes sense to run multiple simultaneous 50-60 person Three Questions groups for a couple of hours at the start of the event. Everyone in each group will learn important information about the interests and resources of their 50-60 peers. For a monthly board meeting, once a year I might run a single session with the ten board members to remind the group of each member’s “why?”. And at a one-day peer conference with ninety participants, perhaps three simultaneous 30-person sessions would be the way to go. In some ways this design consideration is a parallel application of Jerry Weinberg’s Law of Raspberry Jam:\nThe wider you spread it, the thinner it gets.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:3a372d4c-14cc-4c24-822c-59b5c99768e2>"]}]}

Understandably, this policy was put in place to prevent people from taking advantage of the system. If you would like to keep the rewards you earned from an item you’d like to return, you can ask the merchant to refund you in the form of store credit. Receiving store credit, however, does mean that you would still be responsible for paying the balance on your credit card account. Does a credit card refund go toward your required payment? Money refunded to your account is not considered a payment or a partial payment toward your monthly required minimum. Additionally, if you incurred any interest from the purchase but don’t receive your refund within the statement period, it is unlikely to be refunded. Don’t forget to pay at least any minimum required payment in full regardless of any refunds. What happens if my account has a zero balance after a credit card refund? If the purchase amount of the item you are returning is the only balance on your account, then your balance will return to zero after the refund is processed. If you have paid your card down to a zero balance and then receive your refund, you will have a negative balance on your credit account. Any future purchases will be applied to the negative balance first. If it’s a card that you don’t use often or if the negative balance is quite large, you may want to request the amount in the form of a check, should your card issuer not automatically send one. The bottom line\nRewards and credit card purchase protections are great incentives to buy items on credit. Refunding any of your purchases to your credit account doesn’t need to be a hassle, even for big-ticket items. Credit card refunds are quite simple to accomplish and are generally processed within two weeks.

If you are searching for a new credit card, the purchase protections, especially for returns, are definitely an important factor to be considered.\n\nLearn about payments and the payment facilitator model from our team of experts\nRefund Fraud – The Facts\nBy Dan Spalinger, VP of Global Advisory Services\nFraudsters don’t get day jobs, goes the saying and despite various card security improvements in recent years, fairly simple vectors for such individuals to take advantage of still exist. One of these that continues to be an issue for Payment Facilitators and Acquirers alike is that of “refund fraud”. A common example of such a scheme might begin with the fraudulent acquisition of a merchant account through any number of ways (stolen identity, synthetic identity, “friendly” merchant fraud, typical merchant fraud). Such an acquired account may quickly seek to begin processing (in part or whole) what are commonly called “orphan refunds” but more accurately labeled as unmatched refunds. These refund transactions are unlinked to any prior transactions—because no true transactions have occurred. These unlinked refund transactions are more than likely to have the resulting credits directed towards any number of accounts under the control of either the same or other fraudsters frequently using prepaid cards for ease of use and anonymity. Without rapid identification of such events, Payment Facilitator and Acquirer losses can ramp quickly and six or seven figure loss liabilities are not unheard of. One method of confronting these fraud events is simply to disable the capability for any terminal or system. Not allowing any refund to be processed that does not match to a prior transaction can work—if you maintain awareness of the need to do so as you expand your support of various devices and systems or move into different business verticals that may be more subject to this type of fraud than others. Simply prohibiting such transactions is not always feasible. For example, if a merchant has previously processed transactions with one acquirer and then moved its processing relationship to the Payment Facilitator, there may be a need or request to process an unmatched refund via their new acquiring relationship. The card brands themselves have been aware of such a method of fraud and include rules requiring monitoring for such occurrences by an Acquirer or Payment Facilitator. They specifically call for identification of unusual credit voucher activity to include credit vouchers without offsetting activity. All Payment Facilitators should be aware of this requirement even if their current systems and processes do not support unmatched refunds today. Infinicept provides the method by which to monitor for these transactions within its exception reporting capabilities. To the extent that a Payment Facilitator wishes to identify and review every unmatched refund it has that capability. Identifying these incidents via the Infinicept system quickly is an easy first step to take in halting such events. Of course, robust underwriting and customer due diligence at the inception of a relationship stands as the foremost method of weeding out such bad actors, looking for typical fraudster red flags including requested account changes in the early days of a merchant relationship, use of “general” vs. corporate email accounts, and similar.\n\nA payment method can be defined as stored payment information that has been verified for a debit \/ credit card or checking account.

A \"bench warrant\" is a warrant for your arrest that's been issued by the \"bench\" (by the judge.) It means that a judge has directed police officers to arrest you if they find you. Why Do I Have a Bench Warrant? There are a few reasons you could have a bench warrant. Bench warrants are commonly issued when someone doesn't complete a requirement of their sentence, doesn't pay a fine or court costs, or, most commonly, doesn't show up for a court date. Failure to Appear Penalties\nIt may be a simple misdemeanor to willfully fail to appear for your court date when you've been directed to show up by a citation (like a speeding ticket.) In addition, the court can punish you for contempt. If you're out on bail, you'll forfeit bail -- that means you or whoever bailed you out won't get their money back when the case is over. If the court lets you out on bail again, the bail amount you're expected to pay will probably be higher than the bail amount that you forfeited was, and it will likely be \"cash only\" bail, which means you'll have to pay the whole thing in cash (no bail bonds allowed) or hang out in jail until your case is over. If you have an active arrest warrant, this is a good time to get in touch with a criminal defense lawyer at Clark & Sears Law. We can't guarantee any particular outcome, but we can sit down with you and talk about your case. It won't cost you anything. Your chances of resolving a bench warrant without getting arrested are better if you talk to an attorney, resolve any issues underlying the warrant (such as not paying a fine) and then arrange to appear before a judge instead of waiting for a cop to pick you up for speeding or for breathing too loudly in public. If we take your case, we can set up text (or email) reminders for your court dates, if you'd like, so that you won't forget and miss another one.\n\n2013 ORS § 153.992¹\nPenalty for failure to appear\n(1) A person commits the offense of failure to appear in a violation proceeding if the person has been served with a violation citation issued under this chapter and the person knowingly fails to do any of the following:\n(a) Make a first appearance in the manner required by ORS 153.061 (Appearance by defendant) within the time allowed. (b) Make appearance at the time set for trial in the violation proceeding. (c) Appear at any other time required by the court or by law.

After Successful Completion of an Alcohol Education Program, First Offenders May Have the Charges Dismissed\nJack O’Donnell: Individuals would be looking at, as a first offender, being eligible for the alcohol education program which, if after you successfully complete the program the charges are dismissed. You Will Be Charged a Fee to Attend the Alcohol Education Classes\nYou might have to attend 10 classes or you might have to attend 15 classes. 10 classes would cost you $350, 15 classes would cost you $500, and then at the end of a year, if you haven’t picked up a new DWI, the charges will be dismissed. You Can Still Face a Loss of Driving Privileges through the Department of Motor Vehicle Action\nYou still can lose your license through the Department of Motor Vehicles but the alcohol education program is something that you try to get for most first-time DWI offenders. Is Self-Representation a Viable Option to Defend Your DWI Charge in Connecticut? Interviewer: Are the alcohol education classes difficult to get into? Jack O’Donnell: As defense attorneys, we do try to inform our clients that the outcome is never guaranteed, plus being represented by an attorney can get you in and out of court a lot faster than if you are not being represented by legal counsel. Considering Self-Representation? It Is Difficult to Navigate the Judicial System but Online Information Is Available\nAs a layperson, it is very difficult to navigate the judicial system. However, people will research online and learn that it’s probably an easy thing for them to do themselves. Considering the Consequences of a DWI Conviction or a Denial into the Alcohol Education Program, Is Self-Representation Really the Best Option? Interviewer: But it is safe to say it would be a lot easier and the outcome would be more certain if you had an attorney at your side instead of representing yourself. Jack O’Donnell: That’s right. This is because no two judges are the same as far as granting admittance into these programs. This is why it’s just prudent to have an experienced attorney who can advise you on all aspects of the program and evaluate whether or not you should even be applying for the program. Does Your DWI Case Have Valid Defensible Issues? It Is Possible That the Alcohol Education Program Isn’t the Best Option\nFor example, maybe there are some defensible issues in this particular case and you make the prosecutor take a long, hard look at it. Then, the alcohol program would be a fallback position as opposed to your go-to option. Interviewer: If the alcohol education program is not an option, what are the possible penalties someone will face for a first time DUI? First-Time DWI Offenders May Face a Six Month Jail Sentence; More Likely the Penalties Will Comprise Fines, Probation and a License Suspension\nJack O’Donnell: The possible penalty is six months in jail. However, you are not likely to be sentenced six months in jail unless something really egregious transpired. Your license will be suspended and then you’d be placed on probation for 18 months. There’d be a $500 fine, probation costs of $200 and court costs would get you up to almost $795. First-Time Offenders May Be Eligible for a Permit to Drive to and from Their Place of Employment\nConnecticut still may issue a work permit that enables driving to and from work. However, that’s only for our first-timer offenders who are subject to the 90-day license suspension. The work permit serves as a partial driving privilege restoration for those 90 days. Driver’s with License Suspensions for Twelve Months Will Be Required to Install an Ignition Interlock Device in Order to Drive within That Year\nIf you lost your license for 120 days, you can get the work permit for 120 days, but if you lost it for a year, you had no ability to go to work. They now order the installation of an ignition interlock device, which is now available to people after 45 days. However, in that case, you are still without a license for 45 days.","passages":[{"passage":"If you are charged with committing a second OWI offense, then a conviction results in a charge for an aggravated misdemeanor.

A \"bench warrant\" is a warrant for your arrest that's been issued by the \"bench\" (by the judge.) It means that a judge has directed police officers to arrest you if they find you. Why Do I Have a Bench Warrant? There are a few reasons you could have a bench warrant. Bench warrants are commonly issued when someone doesn't complete a requirement of their sentence, doesn't pay a fine or court costs, or, most commonly, doesn't show up for a court date. Failure to Appear Penalties\nIt may be a simple misdemeanor to willfully fail to appear for your court date when you've been directed to show up by a citation (like a speeding ticket.) In addition, the court can punish you for contempt. If you're out on bail, you'll forfeit bail -- that means you or whoever bailed you out won't get their money back when the case is over. If the court lets you out on bail again, the bail amount you're expected to pay will probably be higher than the bail amount that you forfeited was, and it will likely be \"cash only\" bail, which means you'll have to pay the whole thing in cash (no bail bonds allowed) or hang out in jail until your case is over. If you have an active arrest warrant, this is a good time to get in touch with a criminal defense lawyer at Clark & Sears Law. We can't guarantee any particular outcome, but we can sit down with you and talk about your case. It won't cost you anything. Your chances of resolving a bench warrant without getting arrested are better if you talk to an attorney, resolve any issues underlying the warrant (such as not paying a fine) and then arrange to appear before a judge instead of waiting for a cop to pick you up for speeding or for breathing too loudly in public. If we take your case, we can set up text (or email) reminders for your court dates, if you'd like, so that you won't forget and miss another one.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:2ffb586e-c613-4027-a9cb-ea5a645c2a34>"]},{"passage":"2013 ORS § 153.992¹\nPenalty for failure to appear\n(1) A person commits the offense of failure to appear in a violation proceeding if the person has been served with a violation citation issued under this chapter and the person knowingly fails to do any of the following:\n(a) Make a first appearance in the manner required by ORS 153.061 (Appearance by defendant) within the time allowed.

After Successful Completion of an Alcohol Education Program, First Offenders May Have the Charges Dismissed\nJack O’Donnell: Individuals would be looking at, as a first offender, being eligible for the alcohol education program which, if after you successfully complete the program the charges are dismissed. You Will Be Charged a Fee to Attend the Alcohol Education Classes\nYou might have to attend 10 classes or you might have to attend 15 classes. 10 classes would cost you $350, 15 classes would cost you $500, and then at the end of a year, if you haven’t picked up a new DWI, the charges will be dismissed. You Can Still Face a Loss of Driving Privileges through the Department of Motor Vehicle Action\nYou still can lose your license through the Department of Motor Vehicles but the alcohol education program is something that you try to get for most first-time DWI offenders. Is Self-Representation a Viable Option to Defend Your DWI Charge in Connecticut? Interviewer: Are the alcohol education classes difficult to get into? Jack O’Donnell: As defense attorneys, we do try to inform our clients that the outcome is never guaranteed, plus being represented by an attorney can get you in and out of court a lot faster than if you are not being represented by legal counsel. Considering Self-Representation? It Is Difficult to Navigate the Judicial System but Online Information Is Available\nAs a layperson, it is very difficult to navigate the judicial system. However, people will research online and learn that it’s probably an easy thing for them to do themselves. Considering the Consequences of a DWI Conviction or a Denial into the Alcohol Education Program, Is Self-Representation Really the Best Option? Interviewer: But it is safe to say it would be a lot easier and the outcome would be more certain if you had an attorney at your side instead of representing yourself. Jack O’Donnell: That’s right. This is because no two judges are the same as far as granting admittance into these programs. This is why it’s just prudent to have an experienced attorney who can advise you on all aspects of the program and evaluate whether or not you should even be applying for the program. Does Your DWI Case Have Valid Defensible Issues? It Is Possible That the Alcohol Education Program Isn’t the Best Option\nFor example, maybe there are some defensible issues in this particular case and you make the prosecutor take a long, hard look at it. Then, the alcohol program would be a fallback position as opposed to your go-to option. Interviewer: If the alcohol education program is not an option, what are the possible penalties someone will face for a first time DUI? First-Time DWI Offenders May Face a Six Month Jail Sentence; More Likely the Penalties Will Comprise Fines, Probation and a License Suspension\nJack O’Donnell: The possible penalty is six months in jail. However, you are not likely to be sentenced six months in jail unless something really egregious transpired. Your license will be suspended and then you’d be placed on probation for 18 months. There’d be a $500 fine, probation costs of $200 and court costs would get you up to almost $795. First-Time Offenders May Be Eligible for a Permit to Drive to and from Their Place of Employment\nConnecticut still may issue a work permit that enables driving to and from work. However, that’s only for our first-timer offenders who are subject to the 90-day license suspension. The work permit serves as a partial driving privilege restoration for those 90 days. Driver’s with License Suspensions for Twelve Months Will Be Required to Install an Ignition Interlock Device in Order to Drive within That Year\nIf you lost your license for 120 days, you can get the work permit for 120 days, but if you lost it for a year, you had no ability to go to work. They now order the installation of an ignition interlock device, which is now available to people after 45 days. However, in that case, you are still without a license for 45 days.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:6f798bd2-9071-4289-a475-ecbbdbf737b1>"]}]}

These programs range in focus from cyber-security and database management to disaster response workshops and high-level policy analyses. Despite the design of the individual course, an emergency management curriculum must include the following three competencies. Any prospective student of such a program should be basing their decision on this structure and any graduate of such a program should be able to:\n- Adopt a “Comprehensive Emergency Management” framework – comprehensive emergency management can best be summarized as: “all hazards, all phases and all actors.” This means emergency managers who are proficient in using new technologies such as fixed and mobile asset management platforms to coordinate with other agencies and jurisdictions to best deploy resources and personnel. The focus is a balanced approach to emergency management capabilities and readiness. - Integrate with other Emergency Managers and Agencies – The property management and emergency management industries are trending towards a culture of inter-agency cooperation and collaboration. Cooperation has resulted in increased productivity, a repealing of inflexible and inefficient bureaucratic stalling, and most importantly, an economical use of shared resources. Emergency managers must use fixed and mobile asset management software to gain total asset visibility into a range of fixed and mobile asset inventories. This requires that emergency management organizations work to get other governmental organizations within their jurisdiction to “integrate” fixed and mobile asset resources and broader emergency management concerns (such as risk assessment, planning, training, exercise participation) into their thinking, systems and operations. - Master the New Technologies, Technical Systems and Property Management Standards – students need to learn the tools of the trade. Social media is factoring heavily into communicating disaster response efforts and educating the public of potential and on-going disasters. As such, emergency management students must learn to embrace social media strategies in an effort to harness and embrace the medium. Moreover, as FEMA and the DHS impose stricter and more targeted grant stipulations, emergency managers must become proficient with software that manage not only the deployment and maintenance of fixed and mobile asset inventories but their highly-valuable financial data as well such as depreciation. Among the technological topics today’s emergency management students must embrace are:\n- National Incident Management System (NIMS)\n- National Response Plan (NRP)\n- NFPA 1600 (National Fire Protection Association “Standard for Disaster\/Emergency Management and Business Continuity Programs”)\n- Certified Emergency Manager credential administered by the International Association of Emergency Managers\n- Geospatial and geographical information systems (GPS and GIS)\n- Communications systems\n- Warning systems\n- Computers and hazard and emergency management related software packages\n\n- Assist your partners in providing Individual Assistance by:\n- Pre-identifying where you might establish Disaster Recovery Centers (DRCs). - Once the disaster is declared, encouraging your citizens to register and visit a DRC. - Getting emergency management personnel actively involved to assist State and FEMA teams in the delivery of Individual Assistance programs. Recovery from disaster is unique to each community depending on the amount and kind of damage caused by the disaster and the resources that the community has ready or can get. Long-term recovery can take months or years because it is a complex process of revitalizing homes, businesses, public infrastructure, and the community’s economy and restoring quality of life. Long-term recovery considerations include:\n- Keeping people informed and preventing unrealistic expectations. - Conducting donations management. - Developing partnerships with business and industry for resources. - Considering competing interests of groups involved in the planning process. - Identifying environmental issues and public health measures. - Identifying the unmet needs of survivors. - Implementing mitigation measures while rebuilding infrastructure to ensure against future disaster damage. When we think about disaster recovery, we tend to think of rebuilding homes and businesses, repairing infrastructure, enforcing building codes, paying for new construction, and rebuilding the tax base. But communities are made up of people, and a community’s recovery process is not just material rebuilding and economic recovery. Recovery involves rebuilding emotional resilience and the individual and collective spirit of the community. Emergency managers can take steps before, during, and after a disaster that help facilitate the emotional healing process for survivors, response personnel, volunteers—for anyone in the community whose life or loved ones are touched by the event. Continue Your Learning: Next Steps\nBelow are some steps you can take to begin learning how your jurisdiction manages disaster recovery. - Find out what recovery policies, plans, and procedures your jurisdiction has in place. - What predisaster recovery plans have been developed (e.g., debris management plan, continuity of government plan, continuity of operations plan, other recovery plans)? - Is the emergency manager’s role specified in those plans? - When were the plans last updated? - What provisions have been made for setting up Disaster Recovery Centers when needed? - Learn about your jurisdiction’s recovery history. - Has your jurisdiction experienced disasters for which recovery plans were implemented? - What strategies were used to facilitate physical, economic, and emotional recovery of the community? Continue Your Learning: Additional Resources\nBelow are links to resources you can use to learn more about recovering from emergencies. FEMA’s Emergency Management Institute (EMI) Courses:\n- IS-403: Introduction to Individual Assistance (IA)\n- IS-546: Continuity of Operations Awareness Course (introduces continuity planning)\n- IS-547: Introduction to Continuity of Operations\n- IS-559: Local Damage Assessment\n- IS-632: Introduction to Debris Operations\n- IS-634: Introduction to FEMA’s Public Assistance Program\nThis lesson discussed your role in recovering from an emergency, including:\n- Key roles and responsibilities of the emergency manager in disaster recovery. - Core principles for recovery. - Purpose of a predisaster recovery plan. - Typical disaster recovery operations. - The Individual Assistance and Public Assistance programs. Lesson 8: Administering Your Program\nThis lesson discusses the emergency manager’s role in administering the emergency management program. After completing this lesson, you should be able to:\n- Identify typical administrative responsibilities of an emergency manager. - Describe staffing options for routine and emergency operations. - Identify items typically included in an emergency management budget. - Describe the importance of documentation in emergency management. - Indicate the characteristics of an effective records management system. - Explain the impact of privacy laws on recordkeeping. - Identify strategies to ensure information security. The Emergency Manager As Administrator\nThe administrative functions of daily operations affect the community’s ability to respond effectively during emergencies. Four important administrative functions are carried out on a daily basis and during emergencies:\n- Budgeting and Accounting\n- Records Management\n- Information Security\nEmergency Management Programs: No Single Model\nStaffing requirements and resources vary from one community to the next. A large city or county may have a full-time emergency manager with a paid supporting staff. There also may be a full-time fire and police department.\n\nWe reached out to Mike McHargue, Director of Public Health & Medical Planning and Response at the Bureau of Preparedness and Response, to get his thoughts on the future of the public health workforce and ways our FPHTC Online Mentor Program participants can prepare for a successful career in emergency management. “Retaining our human resources is critical to sustaining public health preparedness and leadership,” says McHargue, who supports both formal and informal mentoring. He knows first-hand the challenges that come with sustaining a preparedness and response knowledge base, especially during times of budgets cuts and staff reductions. “Many of the public health pioneers that established current programs have moved on to new endeavors or retired and took critical knowledge and skills with them.”\nMcHargue is responsible for implementing Health and Medical preparedness capabilities during emergencies and coordinating the ESF8 (Health and Medical) support activities within the established emergency response systems with local, state, and federal partners. “At the State ESF 8 level, we provide planning, training, and exercise support to train and develop current and future practitioners and leaders for local County Health Departments and the Department of Health,” he says. Mentees who are looking to gain employment in preparedness and response positions should have a range of capabilities – from public health knowledge and clinical skills to emergency management experience. Of course, formal training in Basic National Incident Management System (NIMS) for ICS 100, 200, 700, and 800 are required pre-requisites. McHargue believes that a combination of these skills among their total staff is vital to effective preparedness and response planning and implementation. “We also seek out [professionals] who are flexible and can adapt to changing circumstances, are available to work altered work schedules, are available to deploy to the field, and demonstrate their ability to collaborate with diverse groups for planning and response activities,” he says.

Postdisaster plans are based on the strategy laid out in the predisaster plan and will guide funding for public-sector and nongovernmental investments. Disaster Recovery Operations\nDisaster recovery operations will vary with the type, scope, and duration of the disaster. However, disaster recovery typically consists of the following activities:\nRecovery management and coordination: Each partner contributes resources and capabilities and represents different stakeholders within the community. These resources and efforts have to be managed and coordinated in order to accomplish a speedy, efficient, and effective recovery. Damage assessment: Various types of damage assessments are conducted during response and recovery. They are used to gauge the impact of the disaster and to determine whether a request for a Presidential disaster declaration will be made and to help determine the funding levels of assistance programs and the eligibility for that funding. Care for survivors: Disaster survivors may require a variety of care options including medical assistance and supplies, evacuation from damaged facilities, and other functional needs. Community partners may be able to provide some of these services. You should be aware of the status of disaster survivors and how their needs are being addressed. Restoration of services, facilities, and infrastructure: Damaged or interrupted services, facilities, and infrastructure may need to be restored during recovery, including electrical power, natural gas, telecommunications, water\/sewer, solid waste collection and disposal, drainage and flood control systems, transportation systems, and community services. Building inspection: Building inspections are conducted during recovery to provide estimates of repairs based upon previous experience, actual estimates from contractors, or other sources. Potential issues related to such inspections include inspection practices, reentry and access, building permits, contractor licensing, code adequacy, and demolition. Community redevelopment: Repair and replacement of damaged structures provide tangible evidence that recovery is taking place. The planning and community development departments can compare development plans with hazard mapping to identify hazard reduction opportunities and requirements. They can also work closely with the business sector to facilitate economic recovery. These actions contribute to the resilience and sustainability of the community. Support for business recovery: The main opportunity for the business sector during recovery is its ability to form business alliances and professional organizations that can pool resources and solicit help for recovery both locally and nationally. In recent disasters, the business sector has become increasingly active in recovery operations by:\n- Providing resources to assist in recovery for other sectors of the community. - Forming business alliances and partnerships to assist those parts of the business community affected by the disaster. - Reaching out to regional and national business organizations to either request help or provide resources to others in need. Documentation of disaster operations and costs: The documentation of activities and costs is both a legal and financial concern for communities during disaster recovery. Disaster recovery activities should be documented to help protect the community from liability for damages or actions associated with disaster operations. Disaster recovery costs should be tracked in order to support requests for reimbursement in the event of State or Federal disaster declarations. The local emergency management office is an ideal coordination point for documentation and is often chosen for this task. Recovery Assistance Programs\nAlthough recovery is primarily a responsibility of local government, if the emergency or disaster receives a Presidential declaration, a number of assistance programs may be available under the Stafford Act. - Public Assistance is for repair of infrastructure, public facilities, and debris removal, and may include repair or replacement of non-Federal roads, public buildings, and bridges as well as implementation of mitigation measures. - Individual Assistance is for damage to residences and businesses or for personal property losses, and may include grants to individuals and families for temporary housing, repairs, replacement of possessions, and medical and funeral expenses; Small Business Administration (SBA) loans to individuals and businesses; crisis counseling for survivors and responders; legal services; and disaster unemployment benefits. Emergency Manager’s Role in Recovery Assistance\nAn emergency manager is not expected to become expert in the Federal recovery assistance programs and policies. However, there are things you can do to help the processes run smoothly:\n- Become aware of the Public Assistance program and how it may involve local\/tribal organizations.\n\n- Directing the establishment of alternative dispute resolution procedures (including binding arbitration), building on FEMA’s current appeals process, to resolve federal and state disagreements on costs and eligibility questions. - Directing the creation of a joint process for environmental and historical review for disaster recovery projects with the goal of increasing the speed of the process. Amendments to the Stafford Act also include:\n- Directing FEMA to study, and report to Congress, whether it is appropriate to increase the dollar size of “small projects” eligible for simplified procedures. - Including child care as an eligible expense under the “other needs assistance” provided in certain disasters. - Specifically authorizing the reimbursement of the base wages of government employees providing emergency work under certain circumstances. - Directing FEMA to update the factors considered when assessing the need for Individual Assistance in the declaration process. - Authorizing the chief executive of a tribal government to directly request disaster or emergency declarations from the President, much as a governor can for a state. - Directing FEMA to create a comprehensive national strategy for reducing the cost of future disasters.

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended (including the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 updates)\nAs the emergency management system evolves, the focus is increasingly on preparedness. Preparedness refers to actions taken to plan, organize, equip, train, and exercise to build and sustain the capabilities necessary to:\n- Protect against,\n- Mitigate the effects of,\n- Respond to, and\n- Recover from those threats that pose the greatest risk. Presidential Policy Directive 8\nPreparedness requires the commitment of our entire Nation. Presidential Policy Directive 8 (PPD-8) describes our Nation’s approach to national preparedness—one in which the whole community, including individuals, businesses, community- and faith-based organizations, schools, tribes, and all levels of government, works together in preparing for emergencies. National Preparedness Goal\nThe National Preparedness Goal presents an integrated, layered, and all-of-Nation approach to preparedness with an emphasis on building and sustaining core capabilities across five mission areas. Mission areas differ from phases of emergency management. Each area is comprised of the capabilities required for executing the mission or function at any time (before, during, or after an incident) and across all threats and hazards. It is important to shift your thinking to capabilities! Prevention: The capabilities necessary to avoid, prevent, or stop a threatened or actual act of terrorism. As defined by PPD-8, the term “prevention” refers to preventing imminent threats. Protection: The capabilities necessary to secure the homeland against acts of terrorism and manmade or natural disasters. Mitigation: The capabilities necessary to reduce loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters. Response: The capabilities necessary to save lives, protect property and the environment, and meet basic human needs after an incident has occurred. Recovery: The capabilities necessary to assist communities affected by an incident to recover effectively. What Are Core Capabilities? The core capabilities are distinct critical elements necessary to meet the National Preparedness Goal. Core capabilities are essential for the execution of each mission area. There are three core capabilities that cut across all five mission areas:\n- Public Information and Warning\n- Operational Coordination\nPrevention Mission Area Core Capabilities\nPlanning Conduct a systematic process engaging the whole community as appropriate in the development of executable strategic, operational, and\/or community-based approaches to meet defined objectives. Public Information and Warning Deliver coordinated, prompt, reliable, and actionable information to the whole community through the use of clear, consistent, accessible, and culturally and linguistically appropriate methods to effectively relay information regarding any threat or hazard, as well as the actions being taken and the assistance being made available, as appropriate. Operational Coordination Establish and maintain a unified and coordinated operational structure and process that appropriately integrates all critical stakeholders and supports the execution of core capabilities.\n\n|Response & Recovery|\nWhat is: Response & Recovery? Even after the disaster has passed, there is still the need for organization. When help is provided during or immediately after an emergency in order to meet the needs of the people affected, it’s called response. Response, or relief, can be immediate, short-term, or for an extended period of time. The focus here is giving emergency assistance to those who have been injured, reducing the chance of persons getting additional injuries and most importantly, trying to set the foundation for everything to return to normal. In the recovery phase, activities are geared towards the restoring basic services like electricity and running water. Also, this is when repairs start. During this time, it’s important that you support and help those who are in charge of the response and recovery effort. Obviously, after a disaster, you will be concerned about the safety of your family and possessions. However, this isn’t an excuse to be irrational. Authorities will give you instructions, which should always be followed. For example, only leave your home or the emergency shelter when you are told it is safe to do so. What you can do during this period is put the knowledge you’ve gathered to good use. Educate others around you about what they should be doing or if you have any basic first aid skills, you can help persons with minor injuries. You can also help by clearing debris from around your home and community. You may feel as though you’re doing nothing, but during this phase, every little bit counts.\n\nRecovery is a sequence of interdependent and often concurrent activities that advance a community toward a successful recovery. Disaster recovery is based on the following core principles:\n|Individual and Family Empowerment||Individuals and households are encouraged to engage in their own recovery.|\n|Leadership and Local Primacy||It is important to remember that all disasters are local; therefore, local governments must be partners in all recovery actions taken on their behalf.|\n|Predisaster Recovery Planning||Individuals, households, and local governments can enhance their recovery from disaster by taking preparedness measures such as developing a predisaster recovery plan, using disaster-resistant building practices, and participating in or conducting training and exercise programs.|\n|Partnerships and Inclusiveness||Successful recovery involves the support and involvement of all stakeholders within the community and with outside entities that are assisting in recovery operations.|\n|Public Information||The public must be kept informed of the status of recovery operations if they are to support and participate in recovery activities.|\n|Unity of Effort||The combined efforts of all stakeholders will help achieve an effective recovery.|\n|Timeliness and Flexibility||There is no established timeframe for recovery to be accomplished. It depends on the makeup of the community, the nature and complexity of the incident, and the combined efforts of all stakeholders.|\n|Resilience and Sustainability||Successful recovery incorporates mitigation actions and best practices to help ensure the future viability of the community. It also involves the ability to adapt to changing conditions and withstand and rapidly recover from disruption due to emergencies.|\n|Psychological and Emotional Recovery||Disaster recovery isn’t just about restoring places and things. It also involves actions to help individuals and households cope with stress, illness, and uncertainty resulting from the disaster.|\nFactors in a Successful Recovery\nExperience shows that the following factors in a community can help ensure a successful recovery:\n- Effective decisionmaking and coordination\n- Integration of community recovery planning processes\n- Well-managed recovery\n- Proactive community engagement, public participation, and public awareness\n- Well-administered financial acquisition\n- Organizational flexibility\n- Resilient rebuilding\nRecovery—like other facets of emergency management—is a whole community endeavor, beginning with the individual and building to the larger community and local government. Community planning efforts are supported by voluntary, faith-based, and community organizations; local, State, tribal, and Federal governments; and the private sector. Each partner contributes resources and capabilities and represents different stakeholders within the community. These resources and efforts have to be managed and coordinated in order to accomplish a speedy, efficient, and effective recovery. Emergency Manager’s Recovery Role\nThe local government has the primary role of planning and managing all aspects of the community’s recovery. Individuals, families, and businesses look to local governments to articulate their recovery needs. Although community leaders are ultimately responsible for the recovery of their community, they rely on the emergency management team in general—and the emergency manager specifically—to manage and coordinate the disaster recovery effort. Recovery Task Force\nSome jurisdictions establish a local Recovery Task Force—often led by the emergency manager—to guide the community through recovery. If a Recovery Task Force has not been created by a community, the responsibility for managing and coordinating recovery resources and activities is still often accomplished by the emergency manager. In this capacity, you will not be directing or controlling the resources of other members of the emergency management team; rather, you will be coordinating those resources to help ensure their efficient use. Potential Members of a Recovery Task Force\n- Elected\/Appointed officials\n- Public information officer\n- Emergency management\n- Public safety department\n- Public works department\n- Building department\n- Finance department\n- Planning\/community development department\n- Community services\n- Health care (hospitals and public health)\n- Chamber of commerce\n- Business community\n- Voluntary agencies\n- School districts\n- Neighborhood\/Citizens groups\nBoth predisaster and postdisaster recovery planning are critical for communities to develop resilience and for successful and timely recovery. - Predisaster recovery planning identifies activities, priorities, and roles and responsibilities required for the community to recover from disaster. Predisaster recovery plans should include a continuity of government (COG) and continuity of operations (COOP) plan.\n\nMessage from Head of Department\nEmergency and Disaster management is a profession!

These programs range in focus from cyber-security and database management to disaster response workshops and high-level policy analyses. Despite the design of the individual course, an emergency management curriculum must include the following three competencies. Any prospective student of such a program should be basing their decision on this structure and any graduate of such a program should be able to:\n- Adopt a “Comprehensive Emergency Management” framework – comprehensive emergency management can best be summarized as: “all hazards, all phases and all actors.” This means emergency managers who are proficient in using new technologies such as fixed and mobile asset management platforms to coordinate with other agencies and jurisdictions to best deploy resources and personnel. The focus is a balanced approach to emergency management capabilities and readiness. - Integrate with other Emergency Managers and Agencies – The property management and emergency management industries are trending towards a culture of inter-agency cooperation and collaboration. Cooperation has resulted in increased productivity, a repealing of inflexible and inefficient bureaucratic stalling, and most importantly, an economical use of shared resources. Emergency managers must use fixed and mobile asset management software to gain total asset visibility into a range of fixed and mobile asset inventories. This requires that emergency management organizations work to get other governmental organizations within their jurisdiction to “integrate” fixed and mobile asset resources and broader emergency management concerns (such as risk assessment, planning, training, exercise participation) into their thinking, systems and operations. - Master the New Technologies, Technical Systems and Property Management Standards – students need to learn the tools of the trade. Social media is factoring heavily into communicating disaster response efforts and educating the public of potential and on-going disasters. As such, emergency management students must learn to embrace social media strategies in an effort to harness and embrace the medium. Moreover, as FEMA and the DHS impose stricter and more targeted grant stipulations, emergency managers must become proficient with software that manage not only the deployment and maintenance of fixed and mobile asset inventories but their highly-valuable financial data as well such as depreciation. Among the technological topics today’s emergency management students must embrace are:\n- National Incident Management System (NIMS)\n- National Response Plan (NRP)\n- NFPA 1600 (National Fire Protection Association “Standard for Disaster\/Emergency Management and Business Continuity Programs”)\n- Certified Emergency Manager credential administered by the International Association of Emergency Managers\n- Geospatial and geographical information systems (GPS and GIS)\n- Communications systems\n- Warning systems\n- Computers and hazard and emergency management related software packages","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:900654d3-ef19-443d-b60c-ebd7c3b7688a>"]},{"passage":"- Assist your partners in providing Individual Assistance by:\n- Pre-identifying where you might establish Disaster Recovery Centers (DRCs). - Once the disaster is declared, encouraging your citizens to register and visit a DRC. - Getting emergency management personnel actively involved to assist State and FEMA teams in the delivery of Individual Assistance programs. Recovery from disaster is unique to each community depending on the amount and kind of damage caused by the disaster and the resources that the community has ready or can get. Long-term recovery can take months or years because it is a complex process of revitalizing homes, businesses, public infrastructure, and the community’s economy and restoring quality of life. Long-term recovery considerations include:\n- Keeping people informed and preventing unrealistic expectations. - Conducting donations management. - Developing partnerships with business and industry for resources. - Considering competing interests of groups involved in the planning process. - Identifying environmental issues and public health measures. - Identifying the unmet needs of survivors. - Implementing mitigation measures while rebuilding infrastructure to ensure against future disaster damage. When we think about disaster recovery, we tend to think of rebuilding homes and businesses, repairing infrastructure, enforcing building codes, paying for new construction, and rebuilding the tax base. But communities are made up of people, and a community’s recovery process is not just material rebuilding and economic recovery. Recovery involves rebuilding emotional resilience and the individual and collective spirit of the community. Emergency managers can take steps before, during, and after a disaster that help facilitate the emotional healing process for survivors, response personnel, volunteers—for anyone in the community whose life or loved ones are touched by the event. Continue Your Learning: Next Steps\nBelow are some steps you can take to begin learning how your jurisdiction manages disaster recovery. - Find out what recovery policies, plans, and procedures your jurisdiction has in place. - What predisaster recovery plans have been developed (e.g., debris management plan, continuity of government plan, continuity of operations plan, other recovery plans)? - Is the emergency manager’s role specified in those plans? - When were the plans last updated? - What provisions have been made for setting up Disaster Recovery Centers when needed? - Learn about your jurisdiction’s recovery history. - Has your jurisdiction experienced disasters for which recovery plans were implemented? - What strategies were used to facilitate physical, economic, and emotional recovery of the community?

The Emergency Manager As Administrator\nThe administrative functions of daily operations affect the community’s ability to respond effectively during emergencies. Four important administrative functions are carried out on a daily basis and during emergencies:\n- Budgeting and Accounting\n- Records Management\n- Information Security\nEmergency Management Programs: No Single Model\nStaffing requirements and resources vary from one community to the next. A large city or county may have a full-time emergency manager with a paid supporting staff. There also may be a full-time fire and police department.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:c9e76d0f-8e7f-4444-bb59-15589f9fe9ca>"]},{"passage":"We reached out to Mike McHargue, Director of Public Health & Medical Planning and Response at the Bureau of Preparedness and Response, to get his thoughts on the future of the public health workforce and ways our FPHTC Online Mentor Program participants can prepare for a successful career in emergency management. “Retaining our human resources is critical to sustaining public health preparedness and leadership,” says McHargue, who supports both formal and informal mentoring. He knows first-hand the challenges that come with sustaining a preparedness and response knowledge base, especially during times of budgets cuts and staff reductions. “Many of the public health pioneers that established current programs have moved on to new endeavors or retired and took critical knowledge and skills with them.”\nMcHargue is responsible for implementing Health and Medical preparedness capabilities during emergencies and coordinating the ESF8 (Health and Medical) support activities within the established emergency response systems with local, state, and federal partners. “At the State ESF 8 level, we provide planning, training, and exercise support to train and develop current and future practitioners and leaders for local County Health Departments and the Department of Health,” he says. Mentees who are looking to gain employment in preparedness and response positions should have a range of capabilities – from public health knowledge and clinical skills to emergency management experience. Of course, formal training in Basic National Incident Management System (NIMS) for ICS 100, 200, 700, and 800 are required pre-requisites. McHargue believes that a combination of these skills among their total staff is vital to effective preparedness and response planning and implementation. “We also seek out [professionals] who are flexible and can adapt to changing circumstances, are available to work altered work schedules, are available to deploy to the field, and demonstrate their ability to collaborate with diverse groups for planning and response activities,” he says.

Postdisaster plans are based on the strategy laid out in the predisaster plan and will guide funding for public-sector and nongovernmental investments. Disaster Recovery Operations\nDisaster recovery operations will vary with the type, scope, and duration of the disaster. However, disaster recovery typically consists of the following activities:\nRecovery management and coordination: Each partner contributes resources and capabilities and represents different stakeholders within the community. These resources and efforts have to be managed and coordinated in order to accomplish a speedy, efficient, and effective recovery. Damage assessment: Various types of damage assessments are conducted during response and recovery. They are used to gauge the impact of the disaster and to determine whether a request for a Presidential disaster declaration will be made and to help determine the funding levels of assistance programs and the eligibility for that funding. Care for survivors: Disaster survivors may require a variety of care options including medical assistance and supplies, evacuation from damaged facilities, and other functional needs. Community partners may be able to provide some of these services. You should be aware of the status of disaster survivors and how their needs are being addressed. Restoration of services, facilities, and infrastructure: Damaged or interrupted services, facilities, and infrastructure may need to be restored during recovery, including electrical power, natural gas, telecommunications, water\/sewer, solid waste collection and disposal, drainage and flood control systems, transportation systems, and community services. Building inspection: Building inspections are conducted during recovery to provide estimates of repairs based upon previous experience, actual estimates from contractors, or other sources. Potential issues related to such inspections include inspection practices, reentry and access, building permits, contractor licensing, code adequacy, and demolition. Community redevelopment: Repair and replacement of damaged structures provide tangible evidence that recovery is taking place. The planning and community development departments can compare development plans with hazard mapping to identify hazard reduction opportunities and requirements. They can also work closely with the business sector to facilitate economic recovery. These actions contribute to the resilience and sustainability of the community. Support for business recovery: The main opportunity for the business sector during recovery is its ability to form business alliances and professional organizations that can pool resources and solicit help for recovery both locally and nationally. In recent disasters, the business sector has become increasingly active in recovery operations by:\n- Providing resources to assist in recovery for other sectors of the community. - Forming business alliances and partnerships to assist those parts of the business community affected by the disaster. - Reaching out to regional and national business organizations to either request help or provide resources to others in need. Documentation of disaster operations and costs: The documentation of activities and costs is both a legal and financial concern for communities during disaster recovery. Disaster recovery activities should be documented to help protect the community from liability for damages or actions associated with disaster operations. Disaster recovery costs should be tracked in order to support requests for reimbursement in the event of State or Federal disaster declarations. The local emergency management office is an ideal coordination point for documentation and is often chosen for this task. Recovery Assistance Programs\nAlthough recovery is primarily a responsibility of local government, if the emergency or disaster receives a Presidential declaration, a number of assistance programs may be available under the Stafford Act. - Public Assistance is for repair of infrastructure, public facilities, and debris removal, and may include repair or replacement of non-Federal roads, public buildings, and bridges as well as implementation of mitigation measures. - Individual Assistance is for damage to residences and businesses or for personal property losses, and may include grants to individuals and families for temporary housing, repairs, replacement of possessions, and medical and funeral expenses; Small Business Administration (SBA) loans to individuals and businesses; crisis counseling for survivors and responders; legal services; and disaster unemployment benefits.

That’s why Rittmeyer, a German-based precision engineering company, utilizes a high-tech, coax shielding cutting device called the BERI.CO.CUT. To make operation of this electro-pneumatic machine safer, Rittmeyer integrated ACE shock absorbers and clamping elements into its design.\nEnd Position Protection. The BERI.CO.CUT precision-cuts the shielding and braids cables used in electric and hybrid vehicles. As the cables are being worked on, the head of the machine moves. To protect operating personnel and the machine itself, Rittmeyer, along with ACE specialists, selected miniature format MC75EUM-3 shock absorbers.\nThese maintenance-free, hydraulic elements ensure gentle impact of the head against the rear pane, preventing costly damage to both the head and overall structure. And with a net weight of only 30 grams, a length of 70 mm and a reset time of 0.3 seconds, ACE shock absorbers far exceeded the cable cutting machine’s compact requirements.\nPneumatic Rod Clamping. In addition to the shock absorbers, Rittmeyer selected ACE LOCKED PN clamping elements to use in its cable cutting machine. These components are designed to immediately clamp in the event the machine loses pressure as it moves concentrically along two guide shafts, protecting both the operators and the machine itself. They also prevent movement during the cutting process—a critical function, as even the slightest cutting inaccuracy can have serious repercussions in automotive or aerospace applications.\nSuitable for rods with diameters of 20 to 40 mm, LOCKED PN clamping elements absorb forces axially and rotationally. With a holding force of up to 36,000 N, they also reach or exceed the levels of hydraulic clamps without the high cost.","question_category":"non-factoid","question_category_desc":"A question to get advice or recommendations on a particular topic. Please be concise as possible","user_category":"expertise","user_category_desc":null,"question":"What are the best safety features to look for in a cable cutting machine for automotive applications?","gold":"For cable cutting machines in automotive applications, key safety features include shock absorbers and pneumatic clamping elements. Specifically, maintenance-free hydraulic shock absorbers protect both personnel and equipment by ensuring gentle impact of moving parts, while pneumatic clamping elements provide protection by immediately clamping if pressure is lost during operation. The clamping elements also prevent movement during cutting, which is crucial as even slight cutting inaccuracies can have serious consequences in automotive applications.","answer":"When looking for a cable cutting machine for automotive applications, safety is a crucial factor to consider. Here are some key safety features you should look for:\n\n1. **Enclosure**: Ensure the machine has a robust enclosure that protects the operator from moving parts and sharp edges. A good machine will have a safety guard that can be easily engaged to prevent accidental contact with the cutting mechanism.\n\n2. **Emergency Stop (E-Stop) Button**: An easily accessible and clearly visible E-Stop button is essential. It should be able to stop the machine immediately in case of an emergency.\n\n3. **Interlock Systems**: Interlock systems ensure that the machine cannot be started unless all safety guards are properly engaged. This prevents the machine from operating when the operator is in a hazardous position.\n\n4. **Anti-Kickback Mechanism**: For machines that cut or strip cables, an anti-kickback feature is important. This prevents the cable from recoiling and potentially causing injury.\n\n5. **Dust and Debris Control**: Automotive cable cutting often generates dust and debris. Look for machines with built-in mechanisms to contain and manage these particles, such as a vacuum system or enclosed collection bins.\n\n6. **Noise Reduction**: Automotive workshops can be noisy environments. Machines with soundproofing or noise-reducing features can help minimize operator exposure to loud noises.\n\n7. **Foot Pedal Control**: For machines that can be operated by foot, ensure they have a separate E-Stop button within easy reach of the operator's hands, as foot pedals can be difficult to disengage quickly.\n\n8. **Clear Labeling and Instructions**: The machine should have clear instructions and labeling for safe operation, maintenance, and troubleshooting.\n\n9. **Regular Maintenance and Inspection**: A machine with a good reputation for reliability and safety will often come with regular maintenance schedules and inspection checklists to ensure all safety features are functioning correctly.\n\n10. **Certifications and Compliance**: Look for machines that comply with recognized safety standards such as OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) regulations or ISO standards.\n\n11. **Training and Support**: A reputable manufacturer will provide training on the safe operation of the machine and offer ongoing support to ensure operators are well-informed about best practices.\n\nBy focusing on these safety features, you can help ensure a safer working environment for those using cable cutting machines in automotive applications.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context:\nFactors to Consider when Looking for Cable Handling Equipment\nWith the growing technology, a lot of cables have come into play in most companies and industries.

Painstakingly……Read More »\n\nNew Orleans is known for many things: music, food, history. Yet, one very intriguing aspect of New Orleans history is not often articulated, and that is the city’s vast array of ghost tours. Whether you believe in the supernatural or not, it is certain that there is something unnerving about pacing through historic cemeteries, meandering through former murderous establishments, and strutting along ghostly cobblestone streets. Below are listed some of the most captivating ghost tours in the city for those who are inclined to push their limits. With over three decades of experience, the reputable Witches Brew Tours boasts some of the most eerie, most haunting, and most interesting ghostly explorations in the metropolis. The guides themselves are incredibly talented and committed to their role. Although theatrical, their efforts help to make the tour a fully immersive experience that is not soon to be forgotten. While there is, to say the least, a number of ghost tour companies available in the city, I would be hard pressed to name one more worth your time than Witches Brew Tours. With a wealth of options available, the Haunted History\/Ghost Tour companies offers ghost, vampire, and cemetery tours for those looking to engage with potentially otherworldly spirits. The tour guides are immensely knowledgeable, providing haunting detail with every establishment and area visited. Additionally, it should be noted that when traveling through the French Quarter, tour participants will see the voodoo queen Marie Laveaux’s tomb, a vital part to any trip in the Big Easy. Always in competition with aforementioned Haunted History\/Ghost Tour, French Quarter Phantoms provides a nearly unparalleled haunting trip through time. Historically accurate, the tour is not only vastly entertaining but insightfully educational. Appropriate for all ages, the theatricality of this tour is diminished to a lesser degree than in others. In fact, the real fear comes at the hand of stone cold incontrovertible truth. To listen is to feel the transparent hand of the supernatural prickle your skin goosebump by goosebump. The next time you find yourself in the Crescent City, take advantage of these notably eerie supernatural awakenings. The green isn’t always greener on the other side; and it’s time you found that out for yourself.\n\nHappy Mardi Gras! Laissez les bon temps rouler! I thought it’d be fun to explore the most haunted Fat Tuesday\/Carnival cities that I could find. Dare to join me? Let’s indulge…\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\nI think it’s safe to say that the first place that probably pops to most people’s minds if they live in the U.S. and hear “Mardi Gras” is New Orleans. As for haunted places? Yep. New Orleans is loaded with those too. In the French Quarter alone you can find a concentration of New Orleans’ most haunted places. I’m talking haunted hotels, haunted restaurants, even haunted cemeteries! Just a few of the many popular haunted hotels include the Andrew Jackson Hotel, Omni Royal Orleans Hotel, and\nBourbon Orleans Hotel. You’ll find everything from the ghosts of Confederate soldiers, a ghost maid who tucks guests in, and the ghosts of children who died in a fire. Ghosts aren’t the only haunting things you might encounter in this city either. Be on the lookout for vampires. As Stephen P. Unger once wrote in a guest post here, New Orleans’ vampire scene has been active for many, many decades. Centuries even. Ever since the city was first established. Anne Rice certainly had a lot to draw from for her beloved novels. And if you want to take a Mardi Gras, ghost, or vampire tour, Viator offers a bunch, such as:\n- Mardi Gras World: Behind-the-Scenes Tour in New Orleans\n- Mardi Gras Walking Tour in New Orleans\n- New Orleans Ghost Adventure\n- Murder in New Orleans Ghost Tour\n- New Orleans Haunted History Ghost Tour\n- New Orleans Ghosts and Spirits Walking Tour\n- French Quarter Haunted Excursion In New Orleans\n- New Orleans Supernatural Tour\n- New Orleans Voodoo Mystery and Paranormal Tour\n- French Quarter Walking Ghost Tour of New Orleans\n- Haunted History Of New Orleans\n- Ghostly Galavant New Orleans\n- New Orleans Vampire Tour\nRio de Janeiro, Brazil\nAnother huge Mardi Gras –or, rather, Carnival— hot spot is Brazil’s Rio. As for being haunted…well, that’s not among its claims to fame. There are a lot of haunting stories about the real life struggles of living there (especially in the favelas), but no real ghost accounts like what I’m looking for. However, it’s such an iconic Mardi Gras destination that to not include it would be blasphemous. So I searched hard and came up with one haunted place to share. Not far from Rio is the Imperial Museum in Petropolis. (It’s also known as the Petropolis Museum.) Allegedly the ghost of Emperor Dom Pedros II haunts its garden. (It used to be the Emperor’s favorite residence.) Viator even offers a tour there:\nAnother iconic Carnival hot spot is Venice. Mysterious, beguiling, and enchanting, this Italian City of Love is famous for its canals, culture and architecture. But it does possess a dark side. And seems to have its fair share of curses. (Which caught my eye, because of my recently released Shadow People and Cursed Objects: 13 Tales of Terror Based on True Stories…or are they? anthology.) Some feel sure that the Cà Dario, or Palazzo Dario, is cursed. After all, death has befallen all who have owned it. The Casin degli spiriti is a palace that is also regarded as a cursed location. It includes tales ranging from spirit and demon-invoking religious sects who practiced there to a heartbroken suicidal ghost who still roams there. Fishermen won’t fish in that lagoon because of a horrible murder in the 1950s where the killer chopped the victim’s body up before throwing the remains in those waters. And then there’s the very creepy Poveglia Island. Another place fisherman don’t dare go near for fear it’s cursed. It’s a 10 minute ferry ride from Venice and was home to Black Death victims during the plague epidemic. Centuries later it became a psychiatric hospital run by a doctor who tortured the patients. He went mad himself and committed suicide after claiming to be haunted by the island’s ghosts. 160,000 deaths are said to have occurred there.\n\n500 activities found\nNew Orleans Vampire Walking Tour\nVisit the dark and mysterious world of the undead on this popular New Orleans vampire tour.

I’d much rather hike in the woods or paddle a kayak on a quiet lake instead of spending all day shopping, then hitting up the clubs at night. But New Orleans is different…at least parts of it. The French Quarter in particular has a magical quality that nearly persuaded me (for a few brief moments, anyway) that living there might be a dream come true. This was not my first impression of the city, however. My first impression was one of true terror—but not the kind I had hoped to find. There were no ghosts upon entering the city. No vampires. No rougarou greeting me with a vicious snarl, or an unknown creature reaching out from the depths of Lake Pontchartrain. No. My first impression was trying to find my hotel by driving through ridiculously crowded Memorial Day weekend streets: Streets that were planned out in the late 1700s for a population of under 150,000 and haven’t been updated to accommodate hordes of drunks and 21st century traffic. There were far more drunk people in the streets than vehicles…and there were a LOT of vehicles. I adjusted quickly. I typically do. But how does one find ghosts, vampires, and all other creatures of lore in an environment so crowded? In a place that defines the term ‘sensory overload’? Clearly people do. It’s known for being one of the most haunted cities in the United States, perhaps even the world. It’s filled with legends of vampires, and nearly every building has a ghost story attached to it. It seems like there’s a voodoo shop, metaphysical store, or museum dedicated to dark tourism on every block; at least in some parts of town. And yet, though every street has a scary story to tell, I spent a week there and didn’t find even one paranormal entity. Of course, part of that is likely because I didn’t go there specifically looking for them. That surely would have made a difference. When I go back (of course I’m going back) it will be better. I’ll find so much more of the unknown. I know this, because I’ve identified the steps needed to track down all the ghosties and the beasties of the Big Easy. - Stay in the older areas. Stay in the areas where the inhabitants have gone to great lengths to keep history alive. Sure, there are probably ghosts in some of the modern, trendy buildings downtown, but they may be a bit harder to find. See, there’s this theory floating around the paranormal community that communicating with spirits attracts more spirits, and encourages the ones that were already there to be more active. In some cases, it has even been said that this can even attract ghosts to places where there weren’t originally any ghosts. And the old parts of town, the spaces that have kept their history alive, have ghost stories being told on the streets all day and well into the night. So, even if there weren’t ghosts there before, there certainly are now. 2. Go outside. No… The REAL outside. Not everyone knows this, but there are two outsides. There’s the real outside, and the kind of outside. Kind of outside includes streets and sidewalks, restaurant patios, Jackson Square, and any other city space where there’s not a roof over your head or walls around you, but you’re still surrounded by bricks, cement, and metal instead of nature. Sure, you’re technically outside. You’ll get wet if it rains. But you’re not really outside. Real outside means you’re actually out in nature. It means you can look around without seeing a row of buildings or a line of cars. Your paths are made of dirt or rocks, not pavement. So, go camping on the shores Lake Pontchartrain. Spend a night or two in a cabin in one of the many natural areas outside of the city. You’re not going to see a rougarou on Bourbon Street. There are no swamp lights at Dat Dog. Of course, you should still go to all those other places. It would be silly to visit New Orleans without checking out Jackson Square, Bourbon Street, and Dat Dog (or any of the other amazing restaurants the city has to offer).\n\nDid you schedule a guided tour - 9\/11 Memorial and Museum at Ground Zero Free Tours\nWo95\/3919)34 Pieces of YouThe Mystery Fancier (Vol. 4 No. 6) A Guided Tour for BeginnersThe Night Sky Observers Guide - Page 3.

It’s famous for loving life — for Mardi Gras parades, a vibrant music scene, drinking and eating and gorgeous architecture in the French Quarter — but it’s also known as the City of the Dead, with cemeteries, Voodoo, ghost stories, vampires, and of course, the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. In today’s episode, native New Orleanian Laura Martone and her husband, Dan, talk about the history of the French Quarter and some of the haunted buildings there, the best cemeteries to visit, vampires, voodoo and Creole cuisine. Laura and Daniel Martone write fiction in multiple genres including space opera, post-apocalyptic and urban fantasy. They lived in the French Quarter of New Orleans for many years and produced several audio walking guides.

They lived in the French Quarter of New Orleans for many years and produced several audio walking guides. Laura has also written a guidebook to the city and they now live in their RV, Serenity, and travel between New Orleans and Michigan. Welcome, Laura and Dan. Daniel: Hey Jo. Laura: Hey, it’s so good to be here. Joanna: It’s great to have you on the show. Before we get into the questions, I have to ask about the pronunciation of New Orleans because I think I got it from the song, House of the Rising Sun. But when I was there with you guys people pronounce it differently. So let’s start with pronunciation. Laura: Okay. The funny thing is Dan always makes fun of me that I don’t have a New Orleans accent, and I don’t, but my whole family does. But I definitely have been there long enough to know New Orleans is how I think most people pronounce it. That’s how I say it. But people do say New Orleans. The thing that I think a lot of natives hate is n’awlins because n’awlins is like this sort of a hybrid. It’s definitely more of a manufactured thing. You know, some people say it jokingly, but I think New Orleans is pretty standard. Start by telling us a bit more about your links to the city and how you both came to live and work there. Laura: I was born and raised there. So it’s my hometown and it’s my favorite American city. It always has been. We’ve both traveled a lot throughout the US and other countries. So, we’ve had a lot to compare it to and there’s no place like New Orleans. I left for college when I was 17 and ended up at Northwestern University in the Chicago area. Dan’s a little older than me, but we met in a job and we stayed in Chicago for a little bit and then hit the road the first time in another RV and ended up settling in Los Angeles because we both interested in being in the film industry as screenwriters and filmmakers and so we were there for several years. Then Hurricane Katrina hit and it destroyed all but one of my childhood homes. And I just felt this pull, that it was time to go back. So we went there and we started a film festival to bring some awareness to what was happening to the city and try to be a part of the rebirth of the city and Dan just fell in love with New Orleans. It suddenly became his favorite place and definitely his home. He’s an incredible cook. So as you would imagine New Orleans is an amazing place for a cook to be and he has completely embraced the cuisine of the region and everything.\n\nBy Stephanie Oswald\nSpecial to CNN\n(CNN) — The “official” night set aside for ghosts and goblins is nearly here, but if you’re bewitched by the macabre and the supernatural, there are plenty of places that provide spooky sensations year-round. You won’t need a costume to take in these attractions, but if you’re looking for ideas on what to wear on October 31, you might find some inspiration from these historic — and sometimes horrific — destinations. WTKR NewsChannel 3 (@WTKR3) October 23, 2012\nOhio’s unusual tourism trend\nAnyone with a penchant for gloom and doom may want to head for Ohio. The state’s tourism department is promoting all things grim — and it has nothing to do with Halloween. “These experiences are all genuine and originated due to someone’s desire to preserve the history, traditions and tools of the trade,” says Tourism Director Pat Barker. That trade is the funeral home business. Highlights include historic hearses, celebrity death memorabilia and how-to lessons on embalming and burial. The Peoples Mortuary Museum is part of a working mortuary in Marietta, Ohio, and it boasts a collection of classic hearses from past centuries, even a horse-drawn hearse from 1895. Staff members double as tour guides to educate the public on the post-death process. Funeral transportation is also in the spotlight at the William Lafferty Memorial Funeral and Carriage Collection in West Union, Ohio, with vehicles dating back to 1848. The antiques were collected during the four generations that the Lafferty family served in the Ohio funeral business. The Famous Endings Funeral Collection in Dover, Ohio, is a must-see for history buffs curious about celebrity deaths. Inside you’ll find programs from the farewell ceremonies of everyone from Ronald Reagan to Evel Knievel to George Burns. There’s the original temporary crypt marker for Humphrey Bogart and a memorial card from Farrah Fawcett’s funeral. This quirky collection even has a Facebook page. If you want to spend the night in the company of such unusual history, check in at the Sturgis House, a funeral parlor turned bed and breakfast in East Liverpool, Ohio. The death mask for Charles Arthur “Pretty Boy” Floyd, who was Public Enemy No. 1 in 1934, hangs above the washing machine in the downstairs laundry room. It’s just steps away from the embalming equipment that remains on display as an informal mortuary museum. Voodoo culture in New Orleans\nNovelist Anne Rice was born here and her popular tales often include spirited descriptions of her hometown. She’s not the only one to imagine New Orleans as vampire-friendly: The supernatural side of the Big Easy is easy to find on your own or with the help of a professional guide. Several companies offer tours specializing in cemeteries, voodoo or the city’s impressive array of stores selling all things eerie such as custom-blended potions, Tarot cards and authentic voodoo dolls. West Africans brought the voodoo way of life to New Orleans in the 1700s, and the religion flourished in the 19th century. Delve into its many layers at the New Orleans Historic Voodoo Museum, where admission is $5 for adults. Public rituals were once performed in Congo Square, an open space inside Louis Armstrong Park just north of the French Quarter, and even today you can find a voodoo spiritual temple nearby where a modern-day priestess performs rituals. Perhaps the most popular voodoo-related attraction sought by history-loving tourists of all kinds is the marked tomb of Marie Laveau, the city’s famous “Voodoo Queen.” On any given day you’ll find tourists in spiritual meditation or simply gawking at all the graffiti and triple-X markings on her tall white tomb inside the walls of St. Louis Cemetery No. 1. Each set of X’s represents someone making a request in the fashion of an age-old voodoo ritual. There’s also a cornucopia of New Orleans hotels where the paranormal is considered normal, such as the Monteleone, where you can stay in a haunted room or ride an elevator that seems to have a mind of its own. In 2003, a team of paranormal researchers stayed in the hotel and allegedly confirmed contact with more than a dozen spirits.\n\nRead what other Viator.com travelers think about the Small-Group Louisiana Plantations Tour from New Orleans.

The guides were very knowledgeable and made us want to know more, so we bought the books! The homes were so authentic and had been well cared for. The history was presented in such a way that you could imagine being there. We loved our hotel accommodations at the St. James and the people were so accommodating.

We highly recommend them. No problems were encountered and everything went as planned. Terry and Sue Sublett\nJohn had good info but he didn't project very well. It was difficult to hear him and the sound system crackled when turned up. He seemed to speed through the information so there was little time for questions or to truly absorb what he was saying. Dylan, our shuttle bus driver was FANTASTIC! He was soo knowledgeable about everything New Orleans. I am a history buff and like to know details and he KNOWS details. It was by far the most informative tour - and I did them all during my vacation. Please if you can get Dylan consider yourself very fortunate and expect insight you would not imagine. BTW, the actual tour was good - glossed over Slavery and those conditions. The grounds are absolutely gorgeous - oak trees as old as 600 years old and the Houmas House Plantation and Gardens is a plantation in exceptional state. Really enjoyed seeing both San Francisco and Houmas House. Good to do two in one day, making for easier compare\/contrast. Our guide was knowledgeable, funny and thoughtful. I learned a lot about Louisiana history (I now know the difference between Creole and Cajun!) and I saw something unique and beautiful that only exists in America! Thank you Viator. I have been a number of tours since I travel a great deal and this was one of the best tours I have been on. Our tour guide was native to Louisianna and New Orleans and she was able to give extensive history. Truly enjoyed this tour. We did the short tour because there was not enough people interested in the longer tour\nVery interesting tour!

REAL HISTORIAN GUIDED TOURS, NOT A THEATRICAL TOUR\nNew Orleans Ghost Adventures is the first tour company in New Orleans to provide ghost tours that teach people the historical origins of the tales they’ve heard; a study and not a story. Therefore, there are no theatrics (like people dressed up like drunkin pirates). No one jumping out to scare you because the focus is to be historically accurate. Due to this the stories are told by college professors or high school history teachers as well as history students\/historians.

Yet, one very intriguing aspect of New Orleans history is not often articulated, and that is the city’s vast array of ghost tours. Whether you believe in the supernatural or not, it is certain that there is something unnerving about pacing through historic cemeteries, meandering through former murderous establishments, and strutting along ghostly cobblestone streets. Below are listed some of the most captivating ghost tours in the city for those who are inclined to push their limits. With over three decades of experience, the reputable Witches Brew Tours boasts some of the most eerie, most haunting, and most interesting ghostly explorations in the metropolis. The guides themselves are incredibly talented and committed to their role. Although theatrical, their efforts help to make the tour a fully immersive experience that is not soon to be forgotten. While there is, to say the least, a number of ghost tour companies available in the city, I would be hard pressed to name one more worth your time than Witches Brew Tours. With a wealth of options available, the Haunted History\/Ghost Tour companies offers ghost, vampire, and cemetery tours for those looking to engage with potentially otherworldly spirits. The tour guides are immensely knowledgeable, providing haunting detail with every establishment and area visited. Additionally, it should be noted that when traveling through the French Quarter, tour participants will see the voodoo queen Marie Laveaux’s tomb, a vital part to any trip in the Big Easy. Always in competition with aforementioned Haunted History\/Ghost Tour, French Quarter Phantoms provides a nearly unparalleled haunting trip through time. Historically accurate, the tour is not only vastly entertaining but insightfully educational. Appropriate for all ages, the theatricality of this tour is diminished to a lesser degree than in others. In fact, the real fear comes at the hand of stone cold incontrovertible truth. To listen is to feel the transparent hand of the supernatural prickle your skin goosebump by goosebump. The next time you find yourself in the Crescent City, take advantage of these notably eerie supernatural awakenings. The green isn’t always greener on the other side; and it’s time you found that out for yourself.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:0241c846-6edb-447d-955b-62089928a4f1>"]},{"passage":"Happy Mardi Gras! Laissez les bon temps rouler! I thought it’d be fun to explore the most haunted Fat Tuesday\/Carnival cities that I could find. Dare to join me? Let’s indulge…\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\nI think it’s safe to say that the first place that probably pops to most people’s minds if they live in the U.S. and hear “Mardi Gras” is New Orleans. As for haunted places? Yep. New Orleans is loaded with those too. In the French Quarter alone you can find a concentration of New Orleans’ most haunted places. I’m talking haunted hotels, haunted restaurants, even haunted cemeteries! Just a few of the many popular haunted hotels include the Andrew Jackson Hotel, Omni Royal Orleans Hotel, and\nBourbon Orleans Hotel. You’ll find everything from the ghosts of Confederate soldiers, a ghost maid who tucks guests in, and the ghosts of children who died in a fire. Ghosts aren’t the only haunting things you might encounter in this city either. Be on the lookout for vampires. As Stephen P. Unger once wrote in a guest post here, New Orleans’ vampire scene has been active for many, many decades. Centuries even. Ever since the city was first established. Anne Rice certainly had a lot to draw from for her beloved novels. And if you want to take a Mardi Gras, ghost, or vampire tour, Viator offers a bunch, such as:\n- Mardi Gras World: Behind-the-Scenes Tour in New Orleans\n- Mardi Gras Walking Tour in New Orleans\n- New Orleans Ghost Adventure\n- Murder in New Orleans Ghost Tour\n- New Orleans Haunted History Ghost Tour\n- New Orleans Ghosts and Spirits Walking Tour\n- French Quarter Haunted Excursion In New Orleans\n- New Orleans Supernatural Tour\n- New Orleans Voodoo Mystery and Paranormal Tour\n- French Quarter Walking Ghost Tour of New Orleans\n- Haunted History Of New Orleans\n- Ghostly Galavant New Orleans\n- New Orleans Vampire Tour\nRio de Janeiro, Brazil\nAnother huge Mardi Gras –or, rather, Carnival— hot spot is Brazil’s Rio. As for being haunted…well, that’s not among its claims to fame. There are a lot of haunting stories about the real life struggles of living there (especially in the favelas), but no real ghost accounts like what I’m looking for. However, it’s such an iconic Mardi Gras destination that to not include it would be blasphemous. So I searched hard and came up with one haunted place to share. Not far from Rio is the Imperial Museum in Petropolis. (It’s also known as the Petropolis Museum.) Allegedly the ghost of Emperor Dom Pedros II haunts its garden. (It used to be the Emperor’s favorite residence.) Viator even offers a tour there:\nAnother iconic Carnival hot spot is Venice. Mysterious, beguiling, and enchanting, this Italian City of Love is famous for its canals, culture and architecture. But it does possess a dark side. And seems to have its fair share of curses. (Which caught my eye, because of my recently released Shadow People and Cursed Objects: 13 Tales of Terror Based on True Stories…or are they? anthology.) Some feel sure that the Cà Dario, or Palazzo Dario, is cursed. After all, death has befallen all who have owned it. The Casin degli spiriti is a palace that is also regarded as a cursed location. It includes tales ranging from spirit and demon-invoking religious sects who practiced there to a heartbroken suicidal ghost who still roams there. Fishermen won’t fish in that lagoon because of a horrible murder in the 1950s where the killer chopped the victim’s body up before throwing the remains in those waters. And then there’s the very creepy Poveglia Island. Another place fisherman don’t dare go near for fear it’s cursed. It’s a 10 minute ferry ride from Venice and was home to Black Death victims during the plague epidemic. Centuries later it became a psychiatric hospital run by a doctor who tortured the patients. He went mad himself and committed suicide after claiming to be haunted by the island’s ghosts. 160,000 deaths are said to have occurred there.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:2f4a1bc1-0e11-415f-9266-7f7e7a83e9da>"]},{"passage":"500 activities found\nNew Orleans Vampire Walking Tour\nVisit the dark and mysterious world of the undead on this popular New Orleans vampire tour.

That’s incredibly high praise coming from someone who hates cities. I’d much rather hike in the woods or paddle a kayak on a quiet lake instead of spending all day shopping, then hitting up the clubs at night. But New Orleans is different…at least parts of it. The French Quarter in particular has a magical quality that nearly persuaded me (for a few brief moments, anyway) that living there might be a dream come true. This was not my first impression of the city, however. My first impression was one of true terror—but not the kind I had hoped to find. There were no ghosts upon entering the city. No vampires. No rougarou greeting me with a vicious snarl, or an unknown creature reaching out from the depths of Lake Pontchartrain. No. My first impression was trying to find my hotel by driving through ridiculously crowded Memorial Day weekend streets: Streets that were planned out in the late 1700s for a population of under 150,000 and haven’t been updated to accommodate hordes of drunks and 21st century traffic. There were far more drunk people in the streets than vehicles…and there were a LOT of vehicles. I adjusted quickly. I typically do. But how does one find ghosts, vampires, and all other creatures of lore in an environment so crowded? In a place that defines the term ‘sensory overload’? Clearly people do. It’s known for being one of the most haunted cities in the United States, perhaps even the world. It’s filled with legends of vampires, and nearly every building has a ghost story attached to it. It seems like there’s a voodoo shop, metaphysical store, or museum dedicated to dark tourism on every block; at least in some parts of town. And yet, though every street has a scary story to tell, I spent a week there and didn’t find even one paranormal entity. Of course, part of that is likely because I didn’t go there specifically looking for them. That surely would have made a difference. When I go back (of course I’m going back) it will be better. I’ll find so much more of the unknown. I know this, because I’ve identified the steps needed to track down all the ghosties and the beasties of the Big Easy. - Stay in the older areas. Stay in the areas where the inhabitants have gone to great lengths to keep history alive. Sure, there are probably ghosts in some of the modern, trendy buildings downtown, but they may be a bit harder to find. See, there’s this theory floating around the paranormal community that communicating with spirits attracts more spirits, and encourages the ones that were already there to be more active. In some cases, it has even been said that this can even attract ghosts to places where there weren’t originally any ghosts. And the old parts of town, the spaces that have kept their history alive, have ghost stories being told on the streets all day and well into the night. So, even if there weren’t ghosts there before, there certainly are now. 2. Go outside. No… The REAL outside. Not everyone knows this, but there are two outsides. There’s the real outside, and the kind of outside. Kind of outside includes streets and sidewalks, restaurant patios, Jackson Square, and any other city space where there’s not a roof over your head or walls around you, but you’re still surrounded by bricks, cement, and metal instead of nature. Sure, you’re technically outside. You’ll get wet if it rains. But you’re not really outside. Real outside means you’re actually out in nature. It means you can look around without seeing a row of buildings or a line of cars. Your paths are made of dirt or rocks, not pavement. So, go camping on the shores Lake Pontchartrain. Spend a night or two in a cabin in one of the many natural areas outside of the city. You’re not going to see a rougarou on Bourbon Street. There are no swamp lights at Dat Dog. Of course, you should still go to all those other places. It would be silly to visit New Orleans without checking out Jackson Square, Bourbon Street, and Dat Dog (or any of the other amazing restaurants the city has to offer).","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:d337388e-e519-4e78-b849-bec4fec03908>"]},{"passage":"Did you schedule a guided tour - 9\/11 Memorial and Museum at Ground Zero Free Tours\nWo95\/3919)34 Pieces of YouThe Mystery Fancier (Vol. 4 No. 6) A Guided Tour for BeginnersThe Night Sky Observers Guide - Page 3.

It’s famous for loving life — for Mardi Gras parades, a vibrant music scene, drinking and eating and gorgeous architecture in the French Quarter — but it’s also known as the City of the Dead, with cemeteries, Voodoo, ghost stories, vampires, and of course, the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. In today’s episode, native New Orleanian Laura Martone and her husband, Dan, talk about the history of the French Quarter and some of the haunted buildings there, the best cemeteries to visit, vampires, voodoo and Creole cuisine. Laura and Daniel Martone write fiction in multiple genres including space opera, post-apocalyptic and urban fantasy. They lived in the French Quarter of New Orleans for many years and produced several audio walking guides. Laura has also written a guidebook to the city and they now live in their RV, Serenity, and travel between New Orleans and Michigan, USA. - The various pronunciations of New Orleans\n- Why the French Quarter has mostly Spanish influenced architecture\n- Interesting cemeteries in the city\n- Why vampires are associated with New Orleans\n- How and why Catholicism and voodoo are so entwined\n- The importance of music and its influence on the culture in New Orleans\n- The different parades at Mardi Gras\n- Seafood boils as social occasions\n- The beautiful natural ecosystems that surround the city\nYou can find Dan and Laura Martone at TheMartones.com\nTranscript of the interview\nJoanna: Laura and Daniel Martone write fiction in multiple genres including space opera, post-apocalyptic and urban fantasy. They lived in the French Quarter of New Orleans for many years and produced several audio walking guides. Laura has also written a guidebook to the city and they now live in their RV, Serenity, and travel between New Orleans and Michigan. Welcome, Laura and Dan. Daniel: Hey Jo. Laura: Hey, it’s so good to be here. Joanna: It’s great to have you on the show. Before we get into the questions, I have to ask about the pronunciation of New Orleans because I think I got it from the song, House of the Rising Sun. But when I was there with you guys people pronounce it differently. So let’s start with pronunciation. Laura: Okay. The funny thing is Dan always makes fun of me that I don’t have a New Orleans accent, and I don’t, but my whole family does. But I definitely have been there long enough to know New Orleans is how I think most people pronounce it. That’s how I say it. But people do say New Orleans. The thing that I think a lot of natives hate is n’awlins because n’awlins is like this sort of a hybrid. It’s definitely more of a manufactured thing. You know, some people say it jokingly, but I think New Orleans is pretty standard. Start by telling us a bit more about your links to the city and how you both came to live and work there. Laura: I was born and raised there. So it’s my hometown and it’s my favorite American city. It always has been. We’ve both traveled a lot throughout the US and other countries. So, we’ve had a lot to compare it to and there’s no place like New Orleans. I left for college when I was 17 and ended up at Northwestern University in the Chicago area. Dan’s a little older than me, but we met in a job and we stayed in Chicago for a little bit and then hit the road the first time in another RV and ended up settling in Los Angeles because we both interested in being in the film industry as screenwriters and filmmakers and so we were there for several years. Then Hurricane Katrina hit and it destroyed all but one of my childhood homes. And I just felt this pull, that it was time to go back. So we went there and we started a film festival to bring some awareness to what was happening to the city and try to be a part of the rebirth of the city and Dan just fell in love with New Orleans. It suddenly became his favorite place and definitely his home. He’s an incredible cook. So as you would imagine New Orleans is an amazing place for a cook to be and he has completely embraced the cuisine of the region and everything.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:d2b10255-f88a-4565-80ab-9822e71a8753>"]},{"passage":"By Stephanie Oswald\nSpecial to CNN\n(CNN) — The “official” night set aside for ghosts and goblins is nearly here, but if you’re bewitched by the macabre and the supernatural, there are plenty of places that provide spooky sensations year-round. You won’t need a costume to take in these attractions, but if you’re looking for ideas on what to wear on October 31, you might find some inspiration from these historic — and sometimes horrific — destinations. WTKR NewsChannel 3 (@WTKR3) October 23, 2012\nOhio’s unusual tourism trend\nAnyone with a penchant for gloom and doom may want to head for Ohio. The state’s tourism department is promoting all things grim — and it has nothing to do with Halloween. “These experiences are all genuine and originated due to someone’s desire to preserve the history, traditions and tools of the trade,” says Tourism Director Pat Barker. That trade is the funeral home business. Highlights include historic hearses, celebrity death memorabilia and how-to lessons on embalming and burial. The Peoples Mortuary Museum is part of a working mortuary in Marietta, Ohio, and it boasts a collection of classic hearses from past centuries, even a horse-drawn hearse from 1895. Staff members double as tour guides to educate the public on the post-death process. Funeral transportation is also in the spotlight at the William Lafferty Memorial Funeral and Carriage Collection in West Union, Ohio, with vehicles dating back to 1848. The antiques were collected during the four generations that the Lafferty family served in the Ohio funeral business. The Famous Endings Funeral Collection in Dover, Ohio, is a must-see for history buffs curious about celebrity deaths. Inside you’ll find programs from the farewell ceremonies of everyone from Ronald Reagan to Evel Knievel to George Burns. There’s the original temporary crypt marker for Humphrey Bogart and a memorial card from Farrah Fawcett’s funeral. This quirky collection even has a Facebook page. If you want to spend the night in the company of such unusual history, check in at the Sturgis House, a funeral parlor turned bed and breakfast in East Liverpool, Ohio. The death mask for Charles Arthur “Pretty Boy” Floyd, who was Public Enemy No. 1 in 1934, hangs above the washing machine in the downstairs laundry room. It’s just steps away from the embalming equipment that remains on display as an informal mortuary museum. Voodoo culture in New Orleans\nNovelist Anne Rice was born here and her popular tales often include spirited descriptions of her hometown. She’s not the only one to imagine New Orleans as vampire-friendly: The supernatural side of the Big Easy is easy to find on your own or with the help of a professional guide. Several companies offer tours specializing in cemeteries, voodoo or the city’s impressive array of stores selling all things eerie such as custom-blended potions, Tarot cards and authentic voodoo dolls. West Africans brought the voodoo way of life to New Orleans in the 1700s, and the religion flourished in the 19th century. Delve into its many layers at the New Orleans Historic Voodoo Museum, where admission is $5 for adults. Public rituals were once performed in Congo Square, an open space inside Louis Armstrong Park just north of the French Quarter, and even today you can find a voodoo spiritual temple nearby where a modern-day priestess performs rituals. Perhaps the most popular voodoo-related attraction sought by history-loving tourists of all kinds is the marked tomb of Marie Laveau, the city’s famous “Voodoo Queen.” On any given day you’ll find tourists in spiritual meditation or simply gawking at all the graffiti and triple-X markings on her tall white tomb inside the walls of St. Louis Cemetery No. 1. Each set of X’s represents someone making a request in the fashion of an age-old voodoo ritual. There’s also a cornucopia of New Orleans hotels where the paranormal is considered normal, such as the Monteleone, where you can stay in a haunted room or ride an elevator that seems to have a mind of its own. In 2003, a team of paranormal researchers stayed in the hotel and allegedly confirmed contact with more than a dozen spirits.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:9443ff87-e137-4ada-8c01-3317382eb286>"]},{"passage":"Read what other Viator.com travelers think about the Small-Group Louisiana Plantations Tour from New Orleans.

Not that Spanish cinema really needs me to champion it with the number of consistently excellent films that appear every year. Solas (meaning Alone) is in fact quite an old film - it was released in 1999 – but it was new to me when I watched it recently. It is an unsentimental and often very moving film about the difficult relationship between a mother and daughter, forced by the illness of their violent husband\/father to spend time under the same roof. Maria, 35, was estranged from her family when she left her home village for the city only to swap rural for urban poverty, and lives alone, bitter and (when the film starts) pregnant from a boyfriend who has long since done a runner. Her elderly mother Rosa, is initially an unwanted guest not least because she forces Maria to face up to her own problems but as the film goes on the two learn to appreciate each other. And ultimately there is some kind of redemption in what otherwise is a very bleak landscape. I probably couldn't describe watching Solas as a wholly enjoyable experience, but it is beautifully scripted and brilliantly acted - and, like all great films, it stays with you long after the credits have rolled.\n\nitalicizing it could be better since I believe you should italicize words or phrases or titles that are foreign to napoleon made mistake in underestimating his opponents La familia - describing your family in spanish | spanish.

This series was designed to give this unknown branch of film the visibility it deserves. From more than a thousand films, forty-three were chosen to be screened at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in six sessions. In order to spark a dialogue between the different eras, this vastly diverse group of seminal films was shown out of chronological order, blazing a trail through the almost unknown history of Spanish cinema. The programme Documents\/Itineraries opened the series with Fuego en Castilla (1958-1960) by José Val del Omar (Granada, 1904-Madrid, 1982), one of the most important figures in Spanish film. The session concluded with works by Gabriel Blanco (Cadiz, 1936-1991), Benet Rossell (Lerida, 1937) and Antoni Miralda (Tarrasa, 1942), José Luis Guerín (Barcelona, 1960) and Virginia García del Pino (Barcelona, 1966). The cult classic Arrebato (1979), directed by Iván Zulueta (San Sebastian, 1943-2009), was included in the series to introduce the world to a masterpiece that is one of the most hypnotic films of all time, loaded with mysticism and open to numerous readings. Animated Experiments: rhythm, light and colour looks at different periods from the history of experimental animated film in Spain, from pure abstraction to narrative. …Ere erera baleibu izik aruaren…, a nonsense phrase, is the title of the first and only full-length animated feature in the history of Spanish cinema, a film entirely hand painted using animation techniques without a camera. Jose Antonio Sistiaga (San Sebastian, 1932) used 35 mm celluloid film as his canvas, applying paint directly to the film. Investigations\/Metafilm invites viewers to reflect on the essence of film in its different manifestations from cinematic essays to blank screen, passing through a dialogue with dance, performance art, photography and poetry. The programme Appropriations\/Great Super 8 sets up a conversation between the generation of filmmakers who tried to break into experimental film from the avant-garde in Barcelona, Madrid and Valencia during the 1970s and the new crop appearing at the dawn of the 21st century. In addition to this retrospective of Spanish experimental film, the programme offers a chance to meet the artist Toni Serra (Barcelona, 1960) - whose film Minnesota 1943 (1995) is included in the series - with a presentation of his recent works, which explore the idea of trance and the reality of dreams. HYPERLINK \"http:\/\/www.museoreinasofia.es\/programas-publicos\/audiovisuales\/2010\/exta...\"Schedule and programme\n‘From Ecstasy to Rapture’ is a presentation of Xcèntric, the CCCB theatre, produced by:\nAñadir artistas en todos con cronología, incluir algún concepto más, de forma que sea menos descriptivo\n\nYou may remember that when we featured the favorite films of Federico Fellini, the 8 1\/2 director’s top-ten list included… well, 8 1\/2. But then, no filmmaker before Fellini or after him has had quite the same sensibility, so if Fellini made the kind of movies he himself wanted to watch — and I suspect he made only that kind of movie — then we might wonder why his list didn’t include even more of his own work. And maybe we should wonder the same about this list of favorites from Luis Buñuel, the Spanish surrealist who started doing for vivid, dreamlike, and grotesque European cinema in the 1920s what Fellini kept doing for it until the 1990s:\n- Underworld (1927, Josef von Sternberg)\n- The Gold Rush (1925, Charles Chaplin)\n- The Bicycle Thief (1947, Vittorio De Sica)\n- Battleship Potemkin (1925, Sergei Eisenstein)\n- Portrait of Jennie (1948, William Dieterle)\n- Cavalcade (1933, Frank Lloyd)\n- White Shadows in the South Seas (1928, W.S. Van Dyle\/Robert Flaherty)\n- Dead of Night (1945, Alberto Cavalcanti\/Charles Crichton\/Basil Deardon\/Robert Hamer)\n- L’Age d’Or (1930, Luis Bunuel\/Salvador Dali)\n- I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932, Mervyn LeRoy)\nAt the top of the post, you can watch Buñuel’s number-one pick, Josef von Sternberg’s silent proto-gangster picture Underworld. Just above, you’ll find his number-nine pick, and the one he had a hand in himself: L’Age d’Or, the 1930 societal satire on which he collaborated with the Spanish artist Salvador Dalí. It came as the follow-up to their 1929 silent short Un Chien Andalou, a work widely recognized as the foundation stone of surrealist cinema (see also our post on both films), and it came with much greater ambitions. Neither Buñuel’s own directorial style nor the medium of cinema itself had quite found their form yet; those conditions produced a film that still retains many striking and even cutting qualities today, albeit not, perhaps, to the same degree that they caused contemporary right-wingers to toss ink at the screen and start brawls in the aisles. Watch the pre-1930 films on the list, like Battleship Potemkin and The Gold Rush, to understand what formed Buñuel’s cinematic sensibility; watch L’Age d’Or to understand why, when it comes to his own work, he prefers the early stuff.

Written by\nLisa Dowling <email@example.com>\nI sat down to watch this last night, expecting to see the movie with Jennifer Love Hewitt (this one is called \"If Only\" on this side of the pond), and almost turned it off in the first 10 minutes. I'm glad I didn't. Douglas Henshaw looks so shambolic that its difficult to believe he pulled a poppet like Lena Headley, but he is a very good actor and gradually the movie draws you in, taking you on a whimsical ride in the style of Richard Curtis, albeit rather more subdued. My guess is that Penelope Cruz was there to provide American audiences with a familiar name, and she does an reasonable job without ever setting the screen alight. What I'd really like to know though is whether the characters of the Spanish garbagemen came about as a result of casting her, or vice-versa. Either way, it works well, and the resulting story of love, choices, fate and moving on is nicely told, without preaching. Unfortunately, I worked out what was going to happen about half an hour before the end, and for that reason can only give it 8\/10; but it was a good enough film to watch it out, and I'm sure it'll provide canoodling couples with a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours for many years to come. 2 of 3 people found this review helpful. Was this review helpful to you?\n\nI am the writer and director of this feature film. I have always had an interest in romantic crime thrillers. I am thrilled that we can present our film project on this site ... and the possibility that\nbackers around the world will be able to participate in making this dream ... a reality. \"Blood on the Streets\" is the story about a mysterious detective, a beautiful woman, and a criminal family in Madrid, Spain who launches a\nbloody war when someone crosses over to the other side and commits the ultimate sin of betrayal. It is an English\/Spanish language full-length\nfeature film that combines action, romance, and suspense. We have traveled to Spain to scout locations. We met with actors, talent agencies and production companies. Spain is known for having a very\nwell-established film infrastructure as well as their talented cast and crews. And, it is cheaper to shoot in Spain. Once we are funded, we will\ntravel to Spain and begin our preproduction and production schedule. We have a completed script ... Completed storyboards (shot for shot) ...\nLetter of interest from an award winning director of photography ... Letters of interest from bilingual Latin American and Spaniard Actors ... Please feel free to view the actors demos and resumes at ... Soaring cinematic score ...\nWe have spoken to several distributors. They have all expressed interest in the film project. They have asked us to contact them once we are\nfunded and we can show them a rough cut of the film. We plan on having a screening for them. We have contacted a few US talent agencies. They are also interested in being involved in the film project. If we our able to raise our projected\nbudget, then we can cast a couple of American stars. What is the synopsis of the film? Blood on the Streets is the story about a mysterious detective name Curtis Raven who falls in love with Sylvia Buñuel, a beautiful woman with\na secret past. Sylvia is searching for her missing brother David. She hires Curtis to find him, but they come up against a ruthless crime family. Franco Scala is the head of the family and will destroy anyone who comes across his path. Franco has escaped from prison and once again\nbegins his reign of threats and extortion. Franco makes the fatal mistake of getting involved in a love triangle that quickly becomes entangled\ninto a web of deceit and murder. He’s forced to hide in an abandoned warehouse with a hostage in tow. Five years ago, Franco had left Curtis\nfor dead in a dark alley. And now, Curtis has returned to exact his revenge in a fight to the death. But not everything looks as it appears and we\nare left with a surprising twist at the end. Yes. All of the actors from Latin America and Spain are fully bilingual. Have you thought about having an English and Spanish version? Yes. We are interested in shooting a film simultaneously in both English and Spanish and release both versions in domestic and international\nmarkets. Four or five takes in English. Then, four or five takes in Spanish. All of the actors are looking forward to this challenge. Have you thought about shooting the film in the US? Yes, but after making trips to various locations in Spain, meeting with the talented casts and crews, and that it is less expensive ... it makes\nsense both financially and logistically ... to shoot the entire film on location in Spain. Why are you interested in using the thriller genre in the film? Blood on the Streets will use the thriller genre to explore the romance, passion, the sorrow, and the triumph of a deeply human story that is\ncommon to us all. Blood on the Streets is intended to offer all of its audiences a portrait of a man who seeks revenge and the other his\nBlood on the Streets provides an opportunity to fully explore the story of two different men. One of them wants his revenge over being left for\ndead in a dark alley. The other man is a hardened criminal who will destroy anyone who gets in his way. There are several women who\nbecome involved with these men and ultimately some of them meet their final fate at the end. Our film provides a fresh and new prospective\non this story … yet the themes of the thriller are still familiar to a universal audience. What format will you be shooting in? We will be shooting in Sony HD. What will be the total running time of the film? The film should run about 90 to 95 minutes long. Do you have any other feature film projects that you intend to shoot in Latin America or Spain? Letter of interest from an award winning sound designer ...\n\nHow did you get interested in filmmaking? By going to the pictures. I was very impressed particularly by a film called Goliath and the Dragon, because there was a dinosaur in it, by Ray Harryhausen films, and by the original King Kong. If there was a dinosaur in it, I was there. In your Revengers Tragedy diary, you mention taking footage for use in future mini-DV movies. Can you tell me more about these movies? Are they hobbies, home movies or just for fun? That was probably footage for the additional DVD elements. The producers and I had a feeling while we were in production that the financiers or DVD distributors would want more than a half-hour \"making of.\" So we rustled up a small crew, and later, I concocted half a dozen small films around the making of Revengers. They're on the American and the Japanese DVDs, though strangely not the British one. Are there plans to release the film theatrically or on DVD in mainland Europe? The film has played theatrically in the UK and at festivals in Locarno, Cork, and Bruxelles. It was rejected by the Berlin Festival. I don't know what other European sales on DVD or film there might be. You have mentioned several times your admiration for Buñuel and Kurosawa. What are your personal favorite films by each of them? My favorite Buñuel films are El Ángel exterminador, El and L'Age D'Or. My favorite Kurosawas are Seven Samurai, Ikiru and Madadayo. Do you see any similarities in their work? I don't see any similarities at all! What other films or filmmakers do you admire or have influenced your work? I like very much the work of Francesco Rosi, especially The Mattei Affair, and the Russian film Idi y smotri (Come and See), Corbucci's Il Grande Silenzio (The Great Silence), and Leone's For a Few Dollars More. Of American directors, my favorites are Welles, Peckinpah, Huston, Hellman andAldrich. Everything I've seen has probably had some impact on my stuff, unless it was instantly forgotten. Any current films or filmmakers you admire? The only film I've seen recently that impressed me was Gus Van Sant's Elephant. Music has always played an important role in your films, from the classic soundtracks of Repo Man and Straight to Hell to Chumbawamba scoring your Revengers Tragedy. How do you go about choosing the music for your films? Does music ever come first? That is to say, are characters, scenes or dialog ever shaped by the music you want to use? Music was influential in advance in Sid & Nancy, where sequences are constructed around specific songs, and Walker, where Rudy wrote that Walker's men depart the burning cathedral singing \"Onward Christian Soldiers.\" The main theme for Straight to Hell was composed before the film was made, and it was nice to listen to it out there on a desert evening. But I don't think it made any difference to the film. Whereas some of the songs that arose spontaneously in Straight to Hell - \"Danny Boy,\" the \"Hardware Man's Love Song\" and the \"Weiner Song\" - were very significant. Do you play music yourself? No, I have no musical talents. But I like listening to it. What are some of your current favorites? My favorite bands are the Beatles and the Clash. So you know how old I am. I am also very keen on Chumbawamba, Space, Pete Wylie aka The Mighty Wah!, and when I'm in the mood for film soundtracks, Morricone and Pray For Rain. Yorkie of Space has a massive collection of solo material and I have been enjoying that of late. How did it come about that you lived in Mexico City? I lived in Mexico City because it was the capital of the Mexican film industry - the last two studios were there, as was the editing, camera and sound equipment. So even if you shot in Durango, or Zacatecas, the base was Mexico City. I love the Distrito Federal very much. It has a great Metro system, great steam baths, a superb museum of Mexican art - including landscapes by Jose Maria Velasco - the Museo Nacional. And I made many friends there. If I must be based in a city, Mexico is the city I would prefer. You have made films in several countries.\n\nIn general terms, how would you suggest to approach your work? With the anxiety of going to the movies. With that determined capacity to plunge into the seat of the cinema. Looking for something to be revealed, in a broad sense of the relationship of the observer and the world. As a journey, a quest, a testimony. To produce questions and mystery. 3. In reference to your work and your position in the national and international art fields, what tradition do you recognize yourself in? Who are your contemporary referents? What artists of previous generations are of interest to you? The tradition of those who work hard and not only for personal satisfaction, but also thinking that what is said has to be heard. My references are Ricardo Carreira, Diana Aisenberg, Rodolfo Walsh, Robert Jacoby, Alfred Hichtcock, Kara Walker. Movements such as the Situationist and experimental local practices of the '60s. From movies, where sound, image and text is used to create and fracture time. 4. Choose works or exhibitions from the last ten or fifteen years which in your opinion were very significant and explain why\nIn 1999 Bellleza y Felicidad Gallery opens up, creating a space and a state of things which is still an important part of our local art scene. I am interested in the existence of a space container of these features, where many offices and different genres may intersect. Some of them have nothing to do with each other. The fact that it was created by artists is not a value in itself, if it produces what it is meant to produce. What I think that is important in the fact that it was led by artists, is the ability to view and create a community needs. I think the gallery managed to modify and develop other ways to show and produce artworks in the city. It produced links both between individuals and between different medias (literature, art, music). What was shown there during 1999 and 2007 deserves a further development and analysis that I will not do here. “Darkroom” by Roberto Jacoby at Belleza y Felicidad, 2002. Because it made me think of the limits of the artistic productions. “Art histories, convictions and intuitions dictionary”, by Diana Aisenberg, 2004. I am interested in the idea that from many voices you can create a text that exceeds the individual persona. And that the way to present oneself and think art might be contained in the artwork itself. Because it ends on the last page but is affordable countless times, because it does not start on the first page neither finishes in the last one. “Damages” by Diego Bianchi, Belleza y Felicidad, 2004. All the motion produced by the accumulation of things mounted on the spine of the place, it generated a circular and constant motion. He broke the container space. Nothing moved fast enough to change location, but each one of the things that were in the exhibition were difficult to be described individually as objects. Xul Solar MALBA. 2005. The form and content of his ideas. The strength and perseverance of many years of work. The proper office revealed. 5. What tendencies or groupings from common elements do you see in argentine art of the last ten or fifteen years? The lack of criticism among the artists over the things that are happening and the exhibited works in our local context. Thoughts are reserved for an intimate sphere of friends and acquaintances. And that not being said seems to be a disadvantage. What is truly thought about the exhibited works, the events, the awards and competitions and the cultural policies is not honestly spoken up. And when I think of \"speaking up\" I do not mean to categorize things between what is right and wrong, between what I like and do not like; but think about what is happening now developing arguments that exceed those levels. To not expose and develop thoughts is \"to let art be less dangerous, to let art take no action on life, no real direct influence on our moment\" *. The action of openly thinking about art is not only critics and historians’ work.

Not that Spanish cinema really needs me to champion it with the number of consistently excellent films that appear every year. Solas (meaning Alone) is in fact quite an old film - it was released in 1999 – but it was new to me when I watched it recently. It is an unsentimental and often very moving film about the difficult relationship between a mother and daughter, forced by the illness of their violent husband\/father to spend time under the same roof. Maria, 35, was estranged from her family when she left her home village for the city only to swap rural for urban poverty, and lives alone, bitter and (when the film starts) pregnant from a boyfriend who has long since done a runner. Her elderly mother Rosa, is initially an unwanted guest not least because she forces Maria to face up to her own problems but as the film goes on the two learn to appreciate each other. And ultimately there is some kind of redemption in what otherwise is a very bleak landscape. I probably couldn't describe watching Solas as a wholly enjoyable experience, but it is beautifully scripted and brilliantly acted - and, like all great films, it stays with you long after the credits have rolled.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:dd69f2a9-26d8-4ad2-adde-ec2503b52170>"]},{"passage":"italicizing it could be better since I believe you should italicize words or phrases or titles that are foreign to napoleon made mistake in underestimating his opponents La familia - describing your family in spanish | spanish.

This series was designed to give this unknown branch of film the visibility it deserves. From more than a thousand films, forty-three were chosen to be screened at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in six sessions. In order to spark a dialogue between the different eras, this vastly diverse group of seminal films was shown out of chronological order, blazing a trail through the almost unknown history of Spanish cinema. The programme Documents\/Itineraries opened the series with Fuego en Castilla (1958-1960) by José Val del Omar (Granada, 1904-Madrid, 1982), one of the most important figures in Spanish film. The session concluded with works by Gabriel Blanco (Cadiz, 1936-1991), Benet Rossell (Lerida, 1937) and Antoni Miralda (Tarrasa, 1942), José Luis Guerín (Barcelona, 1960) and Virginia García del Pino (Barcelona, 1966). The cult classic Arrebato (1979), directed by Iván Zulueta (San Sebastian, 1943-2009), was included in the series to introduce the world to a masterpiece that is one of the most hypnotic films of all time, loaded with mysticism and open to numerous readings. Animated Experiments: rhythm, light and colour looks at different periods from the history of experimental animated film in Spain, from pure abstraction to narrative. …Ere erera baleibu izik aruaren…, a nonsense phrase, is the title of the first and only full-length animated feature in the history of Spanish cinema, a film entirely hand painted using animation techniques without a camera. Jose Antonio Sistiaga (San Sebastian, 1932) used 35 mm celluloid film as his canvas, applying paint directly to the film. Investigations\/Metafilm invites viewers to reflect on the essence of film in its different manifestations from cinematic essays to blank screen, passing through a dialogue with dance, performance art, photography and poetry. The programme Appropriations\/Great Super 8 sets up a conversation between the generation of filmmakers who tried to break into experimental film from the avant-garde in Barcelona, Madrid and Valencia during the 1970s and the new crop appearing at the dawn of the 21st century. In addition to this retrospective of Spanish experimental film, the programme offers a chance to meet the artist Toni Serra (Barcelona, 1960) - whose film Minnesota 1943 (1995) is included in the series - with a presentation of his recent works, which explore the idea of trance and the reality of dreams.

But then, no filmmaker before Fellini or after him has had quite the same sensibility, so if Fellini made the kind of movies he himself wanted to watch — and I suspect he made only that kind of movie — then we might wonder why his list didn’t include even more of his own work. And maybe we should wonder the same about this list of favorites from Luis Buñuel, the Spanish surrealist who started doing for vivid, dreamlike, and grotesque European cinema in the 1920s what Fellini kept doing for it until the 1990s:\n- Underworld (1927, Josef von Sternberg)\n- The Gold Rush (1925, Charles Chaplin)\n- The Bicycle Thief (1947, Vittorio De Sica)\n- Battleship Potemkin (1925, Sergei Eisenstein)\n- Portrait of Jennie (1948, William Dieterle)\n- Cavalcade (1933, Frank Lloyd)\n- White Shadows in the South Seas (1928, W.S. Van Dyle\/Robert Flaherty)\n- Dead of Night (1945, Alberto Cavalcanti\/Charles Crichton\/Basil Deardon\/Robert Hamer)\n- L’Age d’Or (1930, Luis Bunuel\/Salvador Dali)\n- I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932, Mervyn LeRoy)\nAt the top of the post, you can watch Buñuel’s number-one pick, Josef von Sternberg’s silent proto-gangster picture Underworld. Just above, you’ll find his number-nine pick, and the one he had a hand in himself: L’Age d’Or, the 1930 societal satire on which he collaborated with the Spanish artist Salvador Dalí. It came as the follow-up to their 1929 silent short Un Chien Andalou, a work widely recognized as the foundation stone of surrealist cinema (see also our post on both films), and it came with much greater ambitions. Neither Buñuel’s own directorial style nor the medium of cinema itself had quite found their form yet; those conditions produced a film that still retains many striking and even cutting qualities today, albeit not, perhaps, to the same degree that they caused contemporary right-wingers to toss ink at the screen and start brawls in the aisles. Watch the pre-1930 films on the list, like Battleship Potemkin and The Gold Rush, to understand what formed Buñuel’s cinematic sensibility; watch L’Age d’Or to understand why, when it comes to his own work, he prefers the early stuff.

I'm glad I didn't. Douglas Henshaw looks so shambolic that its difficult to believe he pulled a poppet like Lena Headley, but he is a very good actor and gradually the movie draws you in, taking you on a whimsical ride in the style of Richard Curtis, albeit rather more subdued. My guess is that Penelope Cruz was there to provide American audiences with a familiar name, and she does an reasonable job without ever setting the screen alight. What I'd really like to know though is whether the characters of the Spanish garbagemen came about as a result of casting her, or vice-versa. Either way, it works well, and the resulting story of love, choices, fate and moving on is nicely told, without preaching. Unfortunately, I worked out what was going to happen about half an hour before the end, and for that reason can only give it 8\/10; but it was a good enough film to watch it out, and I'm sure it'll provide canoodling couples with a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours for many years to come. 2 of 3 people found this review helpful.

It is an English\/Spanish language full-length\nfeature film that combines action, romance, and suspense. We have traveled to Spain to scout locations. We met with actors, talent agencies and production companies. Spain is known for having a very\nwell-established film infrastructure as well as their talented cast and crews.

They have asked us to contact them once we are\nfunded and we can show them a rough cut of the film. We plan on having a screening for them. We have contacted a few US talent agencies. They are also interested in being involved in the film project. If we our able to raise our projected\nbudget, then we can cast a couple of American stars. What is the synopsis of the film? Blood on the Streets is the story about a mysterious detective name Curtis Raven who falls in love with Sylvia Buñuel, a beautiful woman with\na secret past. Sylvia is searching for her missing brother David. She hires Curtis to find him, but they come up against a ruthless crime family. Franco Scala is the head of the family and will destroy anyone who comes across his path. Franco has escaped from prison and once again\nbegins his reign of threats and extortion. Franco makes the fatal mistake of getting involved in a love triangle that quickly becomes entangled\ninto a web of deceit and murder. He’s forced to hide in an abandoned warehouse with a hostage in tow. Five years ago, Franco had left Curtis\nfor dead in a dark alley. And now, Curtis has returned to exact his revenge in a fight to the death. But not everything looks as it appears and we\nare left with a surprising twist at the end. Yes. All of the actors from Latin America and Spain are fully bilingual. Have you thought about having an English and Spanish version? Yes.

Yes, but after making trips to various locations in Spain, meeting with the talented casts and crews, and that it is less expensive ... it makes\nsense both financially and logistically ... to shoot the entire film on location in Spain. Why are you interested in using the thriller genre in the film?

Blood on the Streets is intended to offer all of its audiences a portrait of a man who seeks revenge and the other his\nBlood on the Streets provides an opportunity to fully explore the story of two different men.

By going to the pictures. I was very impressed particularly by a film called Goliath and the Dragon, because there was a dinosaur in it, by Ray Harryhausen films, and by the original King Kong. If there was a dinosaur in it, I was there. In your Revengers Tragedy diary, you mention taking footage for use in future mini-DV movies. Can you tell me more about these movies? Are they hobbies, home movies or just for fun? That was probably footage for the additional DVD elements. The producers and I had a feeling while we were in production that the financiers or DVD distributors would want more than a half-hour \"making of.\" So we rustled up a small crew, and later, I concocted half a dozen small films around the making of Revengers. They're on the American and the Japanese DVDs, though strangely not the British one. Are there plans to release the film theatrically or on DVD in mainland Europe? The film has played theatrically in the UK and at festivals in Locarno, Cork, and Bruxelles. It was rejected by the Berlin Festival. I don't know what other European sales on DVD or film there might be. You have mentioned several times your admiration for Buñuel and Kurosawa. What are your personal favorite films by each of them? My favorite Buñuel films are El Ángel exterminador, El and L'Age D'Or. My favorite Kurosawas are Seven Samurai, Ikiru and Madadayo. Do you see any similarities in their work? I don't see any similarities at all! What other films or filmmakers do you admire or have influenced your work? I like very much the work of Francesco Rosi, especially The Mattei Affair, and the Russian film Idi y smotri (Come and See), Corbucci's Il Grande Silenzio (The Great Silence), and Leone's For a Few Dollars More. Of American directors, my favorites are Welles, Peckinpah, Huston, Hellman andAldrich. Everything I've seen has probably had some impact on my stuff, unless it was instantly forgotten. Any current films or filmmakers you admire? The only film I've seen recently that impressed me was Gus Van Sant's Elephant. Music has always played an important role in your films, from the classic soundtracks of Repo Man and Straight to Hell to Chumbawamba scoring your Revengers Tragedy. How do you go about choosing the music for your films? Does music ever come first? That is to say, are characters, scenes or dialog ever shaped by the music you want to use? Music was influential in advance in Sid & Nancy, where sequences are constructed around specific songs, and Walker, where Rudy wrote that Walker's men depart the burning cathedral singing \"Onward Christian Soldiers.\" The main theme for Straight to Hell was composed before the film was made, and it was nice to listen to it out there on a desert evening. But I don't think it made any difference to the film. Whereas some of the songs that arose spontaneously in Straight to Hell - \"Danny Boy,\" the \"Hardware Man's Love Song\" and the \"Weiner Song\" - were very significant. Do you play music yourself? No, I have no musical talents. But I like listening to it. What are some of your current favorites? My favorite bands are the Beatles and the Clash. So you know how old I am. I am also very keen on Chumbawamba, Space, Pete Wylie aka The Mighty Wah!, and when I'm in the mood for film soundtracks, Morricone and Pray For Rain. Yorkie of Space has a massive collection of solo material and I have been enjoying that of late. How did it come about that you lived in Mexico City? I lived in Mexico City because it was the capital of the Mexican film industry - the last two studios were there, as was the editing, camera and sound equipment. So even if you shot in Durango, or Zacatecas, the base was Mexico City. I love the Distrito Federal very much. It has a great Metro system, great steam baths, a superb museum of Mexican art - including landscapes by Jose Maria Velasco - the Museo Nacional. And I made many friends there. If I must be based in a city, Mexico is the city I would prefer. You have made films in several countries.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:387bb762-3aba-4518-a585-f4834a1b5a14>"]},{"passage":"In general terms, how would you suggest to approach your work? With the anxiety of going to the movies. With that determined capacity to plunge into the seat of the cinema. Looking for something to be revealed, in a broad sense of the relationship of the observer and the world. As a journey, a quest, a testimony. To produce questions and mystery. 3. In reference to your work and your position in the national and international art fields, what tradition do you recognize yourself in? Who are your contemporary referents? What artists of previous generations are of interest to you? The tradition of those who work hard and not only for personal satisfaction, but also thinking that what is said has to be heard. My references are Ricardo Carreira, Diana Aisenberg, Rodolfo Walsh, Robert Jacoby, Alfred Hichtcock, Kara Walker. Movements such as the Situationist and experimental local practices of the '60s. From movies, where sound, image and text is used to create and fracture time. 4. Choose works or exhibitions from the last ten or fifteen years which in your opinion were very significant and explain why\nIn 1999 Bellleza y Felicidad Gallery opens up, creating a space and a state of things which is still an important part of our local art scene. I am interested in the existence of a space container of these features, where many offices and different genres may intersect. Some of them have nothing to do with each other. The fact that it was created by artists is not a value in itself, if it produces what it is meant to produce. What I think that is important in the fact that it was led by artists, is the ability to view and create a community needs. I think the gallery managed to modify and develop other ways to show and produce artworks in the city. It produced links both between individuals and between different medias (literature, art, music). What was shown there during 1999 and 2007 deserves a further development and analysis that I will not do here. “Darkroom” by Roberto Jacoby at Belleza y Felicidad, 2002. Because it made me think of the limits of the artistic productions. “Art histories, convictions and intuitions dictionary”, by Diana Aisenberg, 2004. I am interested in the idea that from many voices you can create a text that exceeds the individual persona. And that the way to present oneself and think art might be contained in the artwork itself. Because it ends on the last page but is affordable countless times, because it does not start on the first page neither finishes in the last one. “Damages” by Diego Bianchi, Belleza y Felicidad, 2004. All the motion produced by the accumulation of things mounted on the spine of the place, it generated a circular and constant motion. He broke the container space. Nothing moved fast enough to change location, but each one of the things that were in the exhibition were difficult to be described individually as objects. Xul Solar MALBA. 2005. The form and content of his ideas. The strength and perseverance of many years of work. The proper office revealed. 5. What tendencies or groupings from common elements do you see in argentine art of the last ten or fifteen years? The lack of criticism among the artists over the things that are happening and the exhibited works in our local context. Thoughts are reserved for an intimate sphere of friends and acquaintances. And that not being said seems to be a disadvantage. What is truly thought about the exhibited works, the events, the awards and competitions and the cultural policies is not honestly spoken up. And when I think of \"speaking up\" I do not mean to categorize things between what is right and wrong, between what I like and do not like; but think about what is happening now developing arguments that exceed those levels. To not expose and develop thoughts is \"to let art be less dangerous, to let art take no action on life, no real direct influence on our moment\" *. The action of openly thinking about art is not only critics and historians’ work. It is also something that, although not materialize in artworks, we can be accomplished. * Taken from the interview to Rodolfo Walsh by Ricardo Piglia (March 1970).","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:6e452256-09ac-4310-91eb-2cb898725829>"]}]}

It has expanded over the years, with multiple manufacturers and distributors around the world. Arduino also has the Arduino IDE, the software that you use to program the board. The Arduino is a great educational tool to learn the basics of coding and electronics. There are lots of boards, starter kits, and shields to ensure that whatever your project is, you can find the parts for it. Arduino is simple enough that beginners can dive in easily, yet has enough options that advanced users can use it as well. The Arduino software can be used with any Windows, Linux or Mac computer. See the Official Arduino Introduction for a more in depth overview of the board. You can also see the Arduino Foundations page to get an idea of what’s involved in Arduino programming. Step 2: Which board do I use? Through the years, there have been many revisions of the Arduino board. We will go over a few key differences between the boards. You can see a full overview of all the Arduino products here: www.arduino.cc\/en\/Main\/Products\nThese boards are good for getting started with, and good for basic programming. Arduino Uno – Get it now! This is the basic beginners board. It has 14 digital input\/outputs (6 of which can be PWM pins), 6 analog inputs, and a 16MHz clock. This allows it to interface with a variety of sensors and applications. The Uno operates at 5V, and can be powered via the USB port, or it can take an input voltage of 6-20V (7-12 recommended) on the Vin pin. The 5V pin can supply 1A max for powering external sensors and outputs, if more then that is required you need an external power supply. If you try to draw more then 1A, the board will be damaged. The Arduino Uno measures 2.7″ by 2.1″. Arduino Micro – Get it now! The Arduino Micro is a small control board for when space is at a premium in your project. It measures 0.7″ by 1.9″. The Arduino Micro has many of the same specifications as the Uno, with a few differences. The Micro has 20 digital input\/output pins. 7 can be used as PWM pins, 12 as analog inputs. The serial communication with the computer is done differently, see the Arduino Leonardo board for more details. Arduino Pro\/Pro Micro\nThe Arduino Pro is a board with a few different versions. The Pro is a full sized board, compatible with the various shields. The Pro Mini measures 0.7″ by 1.3″, which makes it perfect for small projects. Each board comes in a 5V and 3.3V version. There are no headers attached to the board, which makes it slightly harder to use for prototyping, but gives it more flexibility when you are soldering the board into your project. The Arduino Pro has many of the same specifications as the Uno, with a few differences.The 3.3V version runs on a 8MHz clock, the 5V has a 16MHz clock. For power input, you need 3.3-12V for the 3.3V board, and 5-12V for the 5V board. The Arduino Nano is used for when you want the size of an Arduino Micro, but the functionality of an Uno. It has 14 digital input\/output pins (6 can be PWM), 8 analog inputs, and a 16MHz clock. It runs on 5V, taking an input power voltage of 7-12V. It measures 0.73″ x 1.7″. More Advanced Boards:\nThese boards have more advanced features for your next level projects. Arduino Mega – Get it now! The Arduino Mega is used for projects with tons of inputs and outputs. All the specs are the same as the Arduino Uno, but it has 54 digital inputs\/outputs (14 can be PWM), 16 analog inputs, and 4 UARTs for serial communication. It measures 2.1″ by 4″. Arduino Leonardo – Get it now! The Arduino Leonardo has the same specifications as the Arduino Micro. The big difference between the Leonardo\/Micro and all the other boards, is that there is no external chip for USB programming. Everything is built in to one controller. This allows these boards to be connected through a “Virtual COM port”, and allows the Leonardo\/Micro to communicate as a keyboard\/mouse to the computer. This also means that unlike the other boards, there is no reset when the serial port is opened.\n\n- Published in issue 5\/2019 on page 36\nMicrocontroller Kits for intermediate Users\nFor more challenging projects\nIf you've been dealing with the Arduino Uno or other 8-bit controller boards, but now need more processing power for more demanding projects, 32-bitters and professional development environments are the way forward. Taking the plunge is not as daunting as you imagined, as Elektor authors Viacheslav Gromov and Tam Hanna show in this article.\n\nFor debugging your programs, you need to do workarounds to see the Serial.prints() in your setup() routine. Arduino Due – Get it now! The Arduino Due is the biggest and baddest of the boards. The most crucial difference between this board and the others is that it runs at 3.3V, not 5V. This means that you may need external circuitry to interface this with regular 5V sensors. You can still input 7-12V, but the input\/output pins require 3.3V. The Arduino Due is the size of a Mega, 2.1″ by 4″. It has 54 digital inputs\/outputs (12 can be PWM), 12 analog inputs, and 4 UARTs for serial communication. It runs on a 32 bit processor, running at 84MHz. This allows it to do bigger calculations (4 bytes at a time, rather then 2), over 5 times faster then the other Arduino boards. This makes the programs run up to 10x faster. The Due also has an unlimited number of interrupt pins, due to the second processor, allowing it to get even more feedback from the world around it. Arduino Ethernet – Get it now! The Arduino Ethernet board is like a Arduino Uno with an Ethernet shield built into it. There is also a micro SD card reader built in. It has the same number of inputs\/outputs as the Uno, but 4 are used for communication with the Ethernet system, and 4 are used for the SD reader. This leaves 6 available digital input\/outputs (4 can be PWM), and 6 analog inputs. By using the ethernet port, you can connect this board to the internet to open a whole new world of possibilities for your projects. The Arduino Yun is a very special board. First, is a combination of two processors. One processor runs the Arduino programs, and the other processor runs a Linux distribution that allows you to write shell and python scripts. Second, it has built in WiFi and Ethernet capabilities, to make it easy to connect your projects to the internet. Finally, it has a built in SD card reader to expand the storage space of your programs. The Yun has 20 digital input\/output pins (7 can be PWM), 12 analog inputs, and a 16MHz clock. It measures 2.09″ by 2.87″. Now that we’ve gone over all the Arduino boards, it’s time to move on to setting up the software! Step 3: Software Setup\nOnce you’ve picked your board, you need to install all the software and drivers so that you can start programming! Arduino has written the best getting started guide, see here for the various instructions for each board. Once all the drivers and the Arduino IDE is installed, you can begin programming. Before you can upload code, ensure that the correct board and port is selected. On the top menus, go to “Tools” – “Board”, and choose which board you are using. Then, go to “Tools” – “Port” and choose the port that corresponds to your Arduino. The getting started guide that is linked above has more information and troubleshooting options if you are having issues getting everything working. Step 4: Basic Examples\nThe easiest example to test your board is the “Blink” example. Most boards have a built in LED, so you can use the “Blink” example to make sure that you can upload code to the board. Find the example by opening the Arduino IDE, then going to “File” – “Examples” – “Basics” – “Blink”. You can change the Pin from 13 to whatever pin the LED is on on your board. The delay(1000) will pause the program for the specified amount of time. It is called in milliseconds, so 1000 means the program will pause for 1 second. Step 5: Conclusion\nWe learned how to get started using an Arduino in your project. Arduinos are a powerful, cost effective microcontroller that can be used in a variety of projects.\n\nThe long awaited ARM board by Arduino is finally here, now you can access higher level functionality while still using the wildly popular Arduino IDE. Warning: Unlike other Arduino boards, the Arduino Due board runs at 3.3V. The maximum voltage that the I\/O pins can tolerate is 3.3V. Providing higher voltages, like 5V to an I\/O pin could damage the board. If you are looking to interface 5V based product to the due we recommend using the Adafruit 8 channel bi-directional level converter. The Arduino Due is a microcontroller board based on the Atmel SAM3X8E ARM Cortex-M3 CPU (datasheet). It is the first Arduino board based on a 32-bit ARM core microcontroller. It has 54 digital input\/output pins (of which 12 can be used as PWM outputs), 12 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 84 MHz clock, an USB OTG capable connection, 2 DAC (digital to analog), 2 TWI, CAN bus, a power jack, an SPI header, a JTAG header, a reset button and an erase button. If you're curious to what the erase button does well it.....hmmm....how can we put this?....it swiftly eliminates the sketch you've uploaded to it....and in other terms: it erases your sketch. The board contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a micro-USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. The Due is compatible with Arduino shields that work at 3.3V and are compliant with the 1.0 Arduino pinout. Some interesting applications for the Due:\nFeatures and Specs:\n|Input Voltage (recommended)||7-12V|\n|Input Voltage (limits)||6-20V|\n|Digital I\/O Pins||54 (of which 12 provide PWM output)|\n|Analog Input Pins||12|\n|Analog Outputs Pins||2 (DAC)|\n|Total DC Output Current on all I\/O lines||130 mA|\n|DC Current for 3.3V Pin||800 mA|\n|DC Current for 5V Pin||800 mA|\n|Flash Memory||512 KB all available for user applications|\n|SRAM||96 KB (two banks: 64KB and 32KB)|\n|Clock Speed||84 MHz|\nThe Due follows the 1.0 pinout:\nThe Due has a dedicated forum for discussing the board. Here is the specification page for more info. Note: You will have download the newer Arduino 1.5 and above in order to have the Due board available in the IDE. If you do any work with the ATtiny cores you will have to temporarily remove the \"hardware\" folder from your main Arduino Sketch folder or the Arduino 1.5.1 IDE will crash on boot. Since we work with the SB-FireFly all the time, this happened to us.\n\nArduino boards are available from a number of outlets including group of Premier-Farnell Companies, namely, Farnell, Newark, Premier-Electronics for the MultiComp versions. Premier-Farnell took a conscious decision to offer their own version of the boards, proving that exact form-fit-function alternatives are possible to make and distribute, hence the Arduino-compatible boards from 'MultiComp' , including the Duemilanove (MC-Nove), Mega (MC-Mega) and Nano (MC-Nano). The popularity of the 3 boards mentioned above is easy to understand when one sees the number of projects being based upon them\nFor the sake of a couple of quid, I'd rather get the real thing and have my money go to the people who got it all started.

In case you are having an impressive and creative idea regarding\nelectronic project then you can avail its services without any kind of issue. Reasons for choosing\nMany individuals want to figure out reasons for choosing arduino and getting answer to raspberry pi vs arduino comparison. Following are some reasons –\n- It can be easily programmed with C++ language. - It is capable of working with the highest\ncommunication speeds with a computer. - In case of damages, the interested ones are\ncapable of replacing it with ease. - If you are buying it then you get ATmega328\nmicrocontroller equipped in it.

On the basis of these factors, the interested ones can\neasily understand its importance and beneficial uses. It depends on the\nindividuals that what kind of activities they want to perform.\n\n+1 the arduino UNO is a good board for beginning, and if you burn the chip, you just have the chip to replace, wich would be difficult for the DUE, and far more expensive (you should find the UNO chip (Atmega328) for 5$, a bit less than the DUE board price ^^)\nThe other good thing with the UNO is that this is THE standard prototyping board on the internet, you shouldn't have any problem finding what you wanna learn on it, while the DUE is a bit new. Even if it is compatible, there are some functions on it that are still a bit hard for a beginner, let the community do its job and you will come back later with some great libraries\nFor the IDE, my advice would be to start with the arduino one, it is really easy, and when you will master it, you will be able to search for something a bit more complete. To learn electronics, the most important thing is to understand the basics, and the UNO makes it easy. When you will need a bit more speed or IOs, you will buy the DUE, you will never regret to have started with the UNO, in a big project it is always handy to have some UNO to complete your main board\nHope it helped\n\nYes these will most likely work for us.

Thank you for your time and help!\n\nEarly Stage Design Considerations of Starting a PCB Project from Scratch\nThere’s nothing quite like the smell of hot solder on a Sunday afternoon, tinkering in your basement as you bring a new electronic concept to life. PCBs are the foundation of modern electronics. Thanks to improvements in manufacturing processes and lower production costs, the DIY community around electronic projects is thriving, and you can easily find instructions for everything from hacking your espresso machine to punch-activated arm flamethrowers. Love technology, but not sure where to get started with your first PCB project? This article is for you. In this post, we’ll do a step-by-step walkthrough of the early stage design considerations of starting a PCB project from scratch. What are you trying to build? If you’re a professional electrical engineer, chances are you’ll already be familiar with the requirements gathering that generally takes place at the start of any product development project. But for the uninitiated, here’s a quick list of questions you can ask yourself:\nWhat are you making? Project requirements will vary depending on what you’re building and if there’s a specific problem you’re trying to solve. Specs for an autonomous robot will differ from the requirements for building a wearable fitness watch. What sensors do you need? From thermistors, to microphones, to buttons, to remote control, and cameras—there are many ways for your PCB to interact with the environment, it’s just a matter of finding the right sensor to do it. What’s your budget? Knowing your budget can help you make design decisions such as choice of materials and components, and number of layers you can have in your board. Who’s going to use it? Do you need to meet certain standards? If your business is building a board for NASA, you’ll need space rated parts. If this is a maritime applications, resistance to salt fog is desirable. There are also “mil-specs,” ISO documents, and other standards you may have to adhere to depending on your industry. More generally you might want to choose parts based on the target market for your business. Things like preferred connectors (e.g. Amphenol for aerospace) or affordability. How many products do you plan to build? Is this a personal project, a limited small batch release, or something that will eventually be mass produced? Your layout, choice of interconnects, choice of materials, and number of layers are all influenced by the manufacturability of the end design. The more detailed you are in your answers up front, the easier the rest of the development process will be. Other common considerations include familiarity with certain PCB design software and existing relationships with part vendors you can tap. Create a Schematic\nOnce you have a clearer picture of what your project is going to be about, it’s time to sketch it out on paper or with your favorite PCB design software. What you’re looking for at this stage is a simple circuit diagram (a.k.a wiring diagram), which is a basic layout of components and electrical connections. For example if you were seeking to build your own headphone amplifier circuit, you might list out the parts such as the subwoofer or speaker, an audio jack, and the audio amplifier circuit (e.g. LM386 IC). You’ll then apply electrical engineering 101 concepts such as Kirchoff’s Voltage Law to put together a functioning circuit, adding all the resistors and capacitors required to make it work. Even if you prefer to use design software, it can be useful to sketch things out with pen and paper first or play around with a breadboard and jumper cables while you’re designing your board. Ease of Manufacture\nManufacturability is something that’s tempting to put off towards later in the design process. In reality, this is something that should factor into your requirements gathering process before you start picking components and materials for your board. Cost optimizations such as using copper instead of higher conductivity silver, or opting for pins instead of high speed interconnects, should be decided up front. Panelization, which involves building multiple boards as an array, can streamline product testing, and make your boards easier to mass produce. Before you invest hours laying out your board, it’s a good idea to factor in the standardized PCB panel sizes of your local manufacturing house. Understanding your manufacturing needs can help you with material selection and where to locate components, traces, and vias.\n\nHow much memory do I need to make it good and have you any tips?

PCBs are the foundation of modern electronics. Thanks to improvements in manufacturing processes and lower production costs, the DIY community around electronic projects is thriving, and you can easily find instructions for everything from hacking your espresso machine to punch-activated arm flamethrowers. Love technology, but not sure where to get started with your first PCB project? This article is for you. In this post, we’ll do a step-by-step walkthrough of the early stage design considerations of starting a PCB project from scratch. What are you trying to build? If you’re a professional electrical engineer, chances are you’ll already be familiar with the requirements gathering that generally takes place at the start of any product development project. But for the uninitiated, here’s a quick list of questions you can ask yourself:\nWhat are you making? Project requirements will vary depending on what you’re building and if there’s a specific problem you’re trying to solve. Specs for an autonomous robot will differ from the requirements for building a wearable fitness watch. What sensors do you need? From thermistors, to microphones, to buttons, to remote control, and cameras—there are many ways for your PCB to interact with the environment, it’s just a matter of finding the right sensor to do it. What’s your budget? Knowing your budget can help you make design decisions such as choice of materials and components, and number of layers you can have in your board. Who’s going to use it? Do you need to meet certain standards? If your business is building a board for NASA, you’ll need space rated parts. If this is a maritime applications, resistance to salt fog is desirable. There are also “mil-specs,” ISO documents, and other standards you may have to adhere to depending on your industry. More generally you might want to choose parts based on the target market for your business. Things like preferred connectors (e.g. Amphenol for aerospace) or affordability. How many products do you plan to build? Is this a personal project, a limited small batch release, or something that will eventually be mass produced? Your layout, choice of interconnects, choice of materials, and number of layers are all influenced by the manufacturability of the end design. The more detailed you are in your answers up front, the easier the rest of the development process will be. Other common considerations include familiarity with certain PCB design software and existing relationships with part vendors you can tap. Create a Schematic\nOnce you have a clearer picture of what your project is going to be about, it’s time to sketch it out on paper or with your favorite PCB design software. What you’re looking for at this stage is a simple circuit diagram (a.k.a wiring diagram), which is a basic layout of components and electrical connections. For example if you were seeking to build your own headphone amplifier circuit, you might list out the parts such as the subwoofer or speaker, an audio jack, and the audio amplifier circuit (e.g. LM386 IC). You’ll then apply electrical engineering 101 concepts such as Kirchoff’s Voltage Law to put together a functioning circuit, adding all the resistors and capacitors required to make it work. Even if you prefer to use design software, it can be useful to sketch things out with pen and paper first or play around with a breadboard and jumper cables while you’re designing your board. Ease of Manufacture\nManufacturability is something that’s tempting to put off towards later in the design process. In reality, this is something that should factor into your requirements gathering process before you start picking components and materials for your board. Cost optimizations such as using copper instead of higher conductivity silver, or opting for pins instead of high speed interconnects, should be decided up front. Panelization, which involves building multiple boards as an array, can streamline product testing, and make your boards easier to mass produce. Before you invest hours laying out your board, it’s a good idea to factor in the standardized PCB panel sizes of your local manufacturing house. Understanding your manufacturing needs can help you with material selection and where to locate components, traces, and vias.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:cbad0000-98d1-4347-8363-5f0bc7b036c8>"]},{"passage":"How much memory do I need to make it good and have you any tips?

However, there are pitfalls along the way. Sometimes researchers want so much to find a person that they ignore facts and make inaccurate connections. This guide will help you ask the questions that will help you decide if a person is, in fact, your ancestor. As you compare what you already know about your ancestor against the new information you find in a record, you can decide whether you have located your ancestor. What You Are Looking For\nYou are trying to decide if the person you found in a record is your ancestor. Once you have found a person in a record who may be your ancestor, the following 5 steps will help you determine if you have, in fact, found your ancestor. Step 1. Review what you already know about your ancestor. Do the following to identify your ancestor clearly:\n- Make a time line, listing known facts about your ancestor. - On your time line, include other persons associated with your ancestor. - Briefly give the source of your information. - Use an analysis chart to identify and evaluate what you know. - Evaluate what that information may suggest. See the following time line for an example of known information:\n|Time Line for My Ancestor: Daniel Currie Hill|\n|Source: All information is from A Dictionary of Scottish Emigrants To Canada Before Confederation, vols. 1 & 2.|\n|1807 Apr 2||Daniel Currie Hill born Johnstone, Renfrew, Scotland, son of Alexander Hill and Elizabeth Currie.|\n|1821 Apr 28||Daniel sailed with his parents and brothers and sisters on the Earl of Buckinghamshire from Greenock for Canada.|\n|1833||Daniel married Elizabeth Bryce.|\n|1835||Daniel moved to Tosorontio Twp., Simcoe Co., Ontario.|\n|1840||Daniel and his extended family moved to Nauvoo, Illinois, United States.|\n|1881 Jul 21||Daniel Currie Hill died in Utah, United States.|\nFor help in making a time line, see Tip 1.

(Show a picture.) It is a very high hill. Very few hills in Ontario are high enough to be called mountains. How high must a hill be before it may be called a mountain? There is no fixed rule for using the term mountain. What is called a mountain in one part of the country would simply be called a hill in another. For example, in some localities a hill about 500 feet high is called a mountain; in other localities, it would need to be over 1,000 feet high to be considered as such. When we speak of the height of a mountain we mean its elevation above the level of the sea. Explain. Some mountains are so low and their slopes are so gentle that one may climb to their tops without much trouble. Others are so high and their sides are so steep that it is difficult and Often impossible to reach their tops. The height of the highest mountain in the world is about five and one-half miles. Their tops may rise far above the clouds and are often hidden by them. Examine as many pictures of mountains as you can find. What shape is the top of a mountain? It has many shapes—sometimes rounded, but often irregular. The top of a mountain that is much higher than the country about it is called a peak. What is the colour of the high mountain tops seen in pictures? Why are they white? They are covered with snow and ice. About two miles above us the atmosphere is so cold that snow will not melt. This is why very high mountain tops are always buried in snow and ice. A large mass of this snow and ice sometimes becomes loosened and slides down the mountain side causing great damage. This is called an avalanche. What name is given to a row of mountains? These ranges, or chains, are sometimes hundreds of miles in length. Why does such a mountain range make a good watershed, or divide? What becomes of the rain that falls upon a mountain range? Which side of the range will have the greater rainfall, the windward or the leeward side? Why? In what ways does a mountain range hinder trade and travel? Where is the best place for crossing a mountain range? What name is given to such a crossing place? It is called a pass. Why was this name given to it? Why do railways always cross mountains through these passes? Of what materials are mountains composed? Rock when exposed to the weather gradually crumbles away. What name is given to powdered rock? What becomes of the soil that is thus formed? Most of it is washed away and leaves the rocks bare; part of it covers the sides of the mountain farther down. This makes it possible for forests to grow on mountain sides. Do you see these forests in the pictures? Why can not trees grow on very high mountain tops? Metals, such as gold, silver, iron, etc., are usually found in rocks. Why are these metals so often found in mountainous countries? Why do fewer people live in mountainous countries than in lowland countries? How do mountaineers make their living? Do they cultivate the land much? Why not? They hunt, pasture sheep, work in mines, etc. What name is given to men who hunt? To those who care for sheep? To those who work in mines? Name some wild animals that live in the mountains. Why do many people go to the mountains for their health? Give reasons why most people find it more pleasant as well as more profitable to live in the valleys rather than up among the mountains? Make black-board sketches and sand and clay models of mountain, mountain range, pass, and valleys. Use -chalk dust to illustrate the snow-capped peaks. Make an examination of a brook near the school. Where does the water come from? Is there a spring, or a swamp, or a tile-drain in the neighbourhood? If so examine it carefully to find out what contribution, if any, it makes to the water-supply of the brook. In what direction is the brook flowing? Why does it flow in this direction? What is meant by the source of the brook? What is its mouth? What evidence can you find that the brook is growing larger as it flows along? What name is given to the smaller streams that flow into it? What is the name given to the land bordering each side of the brook?\n\nThe staff of the Historic Resources Management Branch wishes you a safe and joyous holiday season. We’ve worked hard to identify, protect and conserve Alberta’s historic resources this past year. We’d like to thank the countless people throughout Alberta for helping us to do that. Without your support, conserving our historic places would be impossible. RETROactive will be taking a break over the holidays — we will resume publishing on January 13th, 2014. We look forward to seeing you all in the New Year! An archaeological resource in Alberta is defined as “a work of humans that is of value for its prehistoric, historic, cultural or scientific significance” and is protected under the Historical Resources Act. Sites are classed into two major groups: prehistoric and historic. Over 80% of the sites in the province are prehistoric (which predate the arrival of Europeans); just over 10% are historic (postdating European arrival); and the rest are a mix of both prehistoric and historic, contemporary, indigenous historic (such as Metis sites), and natural sites. Some of the most common prehistoric sites are campsites; stone features; animal kill sites; processing sites; rock art sites and ceremonial sites, such as medicine wheels and cairns. Historic sites include trading posts, police posts, early settlements, homesteads, and industrial sites. Some of the oldest archaeological sites in Alberta date to as early as 13,000-8,000 years ago or what is known as the Palaeoindian Period. Prior to ~13,000 years ago what is now Alberta was covered by massive ice sheets that rendered the landscape uninhabitable. Shortly after the retreat of the ice sheets, however, animals and then people began moving into the area. At a site called Wally’s Beach in southern Alberta, archaeologists have recorded mammoth, camel and horse tracks. Not only that, they have discovered direct evidence of humans hunting these animals! Since then, what is now Alberta has been continuously occupied by numerous cultural groups, whose remnants we find in the form of discarded stone tools, butchered animal bones, hearths, broken pottery, buried palisade walls from forts and various other artifacts and features. These days the majority of new archaeological sites in Alberta are recorded by historic resource management consultants. Consulting companies are hired by developers in the province to carry out Historical Resource Impact Assessments, which involve the survey and testing of areas that will be affected by a proposed development for the potential or presence of archaeological sites. If a consultant deems an area to be high potential (judged by factors such as landforms, proximity to water bodies, and proximity to known sites, among other things) he or she will conduct surface inspection and possibly shovel testing (digging a hole about 40 cm by 40 cm in size) to search for archaeological artifacts or features. If results are positive, the information is submitted to the Archaeological Survey and a unique identifier, called a Borden number, is assigned to the site. The Archaeological Survey can then offer protection and management strategies for these sites. This could involve requirements for complete avoidance or excavation of the site prior to development. Archaeological site information is stored in the Alberta Archaeological Sites Inventory, an important resource for historic resource consultants and other researchers. Artifacts recovered from archaeological sites are stored at the Royal Alberta Museum where they are made accessible for research or put on display in one of their exhibits. Alberta’s archaeology may not be as visible as in other parts of the world, but we really do have a rich heritage and an abundance of archaeological resources — we just have to work a little harder to find them. It’s incredible what we can learn when we start digging into our past! Tell us, what’s your favourite archaeology site in Alberta? Written by: Courtney Lakevold, Archaeological Information Coordinator. “If you get the right angle to float on top of the pressure of the wind you get more distance.” (Clarence Sverold, Canadian Olympian)\nThe huge metal ski jump at the Stoney Creek Valley in Camrose is an impressive sight. It is the legacy of the daring Norwegian flyers who made Camrose the birth place of ski jumping in Alberta.\n\nOrders, decorations, and medals of Slovenia\nThe decorations (Slovene: Odlikovanja Republike Slovenije) for citizens who do great deeds for, or on behalf of, the country. Orders of Freedom of the Republic of Slovenia\nThe Orders of Freedom of the Republic of Slovenia (Slovene: Častni znaki svobode RS) are a special class of decorations \"for services rendered in the defence of freedom and assertion of the sovereignty of the Republic of Slovenia or only in connection with the said acts related to the gaining of independence.\" They are the highest civilian award given by the government of Slovenia. A majority of recipients of the Orders of Freedom were directly involved in Slovenia's struggle for independence from Yugoslavia, including the Ten-Day War which established their independence. There are three levels in the Orders of Freedom:\n- The Golden Order of Freedom (Slovene: Zlati častni znak svobode RS) is symbolised with a medal on a necklace. The medal is a gold version of the Order of Freedom medallion, on a blue ribbon necklace with tricolor stripes. The bar pin is also gold. - The Silver Order of Freedom (Slovene: Srebrni častni znak svobode RS) is symbolised the same way as the Order of Freedom, but the medallion and bar pins are silver. - The Order of Freedom (Slovene: Častni znak svobode RS) is symbolised by a small crystal medallion with a center medal in the tricolors of the Slovenian flag. Recipients also receive an aluminum bar pin with the Slovenian tricolors in the center. The Orders of Freedom were established by the Orders of Freedom of the Republic of Slovenia Act in 1992. Other Orders and Medals\nThe other orders and medals (Slovene: Redi in medalje) were established to honor works that advance Slovenia as a nation. With the exception of the highest honor, the Order of Exceptional Merits, they are split into three different categories, with a different medal design for each category: civil field, diplomatic and international field, and military or security field. These decorations were established by the Decorations of the Republic of Slovenia Act, instituted in 2004. Except for the Order of Exceptional Merits each field has a slightly different medal design. - The Order for Exceptional Merits (Slovene: Red za izredne zasluge) is \"for exceptional work and services rendered in advancing the sovereignty, prosperity, renown and progress of Slovenia.\" It is a white, blue and gold medal with a red dot at the center, suspended from a gold and red ribbon pin. It includes a gold and red bar pin. - The Golden Order for Merits (Slovene: Zlati red za zasluge) is \"for exceptional merits accomplished for Slovenia.\" Its medal is the same as the Order of Exceptional Merits, but is suspended on a yellow ribbon pin. It includes a yellow bar pin in addition. - The Silver Order for Merits (Slovene: Srebrni red za zasluge) is \"for exceptional work and services rendered in the security, defence and protection of the Republic of Slovenia and for international cooperation in these fields.\" Its medal is similar to the Golden Order, but has silver backing and a silver center shield, and is suspended from a blue ribbon pin. It includes a blue bar pin. - The Order for Merits (Slovene: Red za zasluge) is \"for services accomplished for the Republic of Slovenia in other fields.\" Its medal is similar to the Silver Order, but lacks the silver backing. - The Medal for Merits (Slovene: Medalja za zasluge) is \"for especially remarkable achievements and results in the fields marking an important contribution to the development and international standing of the Republic of Slovenia.\" Its medal is white with a blue backing and silver center shield, suspended on a blue ribbon pin with three horizontal gold stripes. Its bar pin is blue with three vertical gold stripes. - The Medal for Valour (Slovene: Medalja za hrabrost) is \"for personal valour and self-sacrifice in saving human lives and material goods.\" Its medal and bar pin are similar to the Medal for Merits, but have only two gold stripes. It is the only honor that does not have a provision for being conferred upon foreign nationals or organisations. - The Medal for Honourable Action (Slovene: Medalja za častna dejanja) is \"for exceptional actions worthy of particular distinction.\"\n\nValor is a gift. Those having it never\nknow for sure if they have it till the test comes. And those having\nit in one test never know for sure if they will have it when the\nnext test comes. For those who have valiantly engaged themselves\nin war, Sandburg’s reflections likely ring true. Bravery among\nenlisted personnel is not uncommon; it can be argued that all soldiers\ndemonstrate courage during combat, even if others never witness\nBut, there are great acts of military valor that\ndo not go unnoticed. These are recognized through the Medal of Honor—\npresented by the president in the name of Congress— the highest\nmilitary honor that can be bestowed upon any American. On December 9, 1861 Iowa Senator James W. Grimes\nintroduced S. No. 82 in the United States Senate, a bill designed\nto \"promote the efficiency of the Navy\" by authorizing\nthe production and distribution of \"medals of honor\". On December 21st the bill was passed, authorizing 200 such medals\nbe produced\" which shall be bestowed upon such petty officers,\nseamen, landsmen and marines as shall distinguish themselves by\ntheir gallantry in action and other seamanlike qualities during\nthe present war (Civil War).\" President Lincoln signed the\nbill and the (Navy) Medal of Honor was born. Two months later on February 17, 1862 Massachusetts\nSenator Henry Wilson introduced a similar bill, this one to authorize\n\"the President to distribute medals to privates in the Army\nof the United States who shall distinguish themselves in battle.\" Over the following months wording changed slightly as the bill made\nits way through Congress. When President Abraham Lincoln signed\nS.J.R. No 82 into law as 12 Stat. 623-624 on July 14, 1862, the\nArmy Medal of Honor was born. It read in part:\nResolved by the Senate and House of Representatives\nof the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the\nPresident of the United States be, and he is hereby, authorized\nto cause two thousand \"medals of honor\" to be prepared\nwith suitable emblematic devices, and to direct that the same be\npresented, in the name of the Congress, to such non--commissioned\nofficers and privates as shall most distinguish themselves by their\ngallantry in action, and other soldier-like qualities, during the\npresent insurrection (Civil War). Though there are myriad military heroes, many unsung,\nthe Medal of Honor sets specific provisions for recipients. At least\ntwo eyewitnesses must provide “incontestable evidence”\nto a deed that proves to “be so outstanding, that it clearly\ndistinguishes gallantry beyond the call of duty from lesser forms\nof bravery, involve the risk of life, and be the type of deed, which,\nif not done, would not subject the recipient to any unjustified\nThe correct title of the award is the Medal of Honor. Because the U.S. President presents the medal in the name of the\nUnited States Congress, it is sometimes called the Congressional\nMedal of Honor. The latter title is typically connected only with\nthe organization—the Congressional Medal of Honor Society—that\nrepresents those who have earned the medal. There are also\nthree medals for the Navy, Army, and Air Force. Conceived in 1860 and first awarded in 1863, the\nMedal of Honor has been awarded only 3,459 times to 3,440 recipients,\nalmost half of them Civil War soldiers. (There have been 19 double\nrecipients.) More than half of those who have received the Medal\nof Honor did not survive the action for which it was awarded. Over the years, the Medal of Honor’s parameters\nhave undergone revisions to ensure it is justly bestowed upon those\nwho merit it, even if this is done in a belated fashion. It took\nnearly 60 years, for example, for 29 African-American and Asian-American\nheroes to be recognized for their actions in World War II. They\nwere finally honored, many posthumously, at ceremonies at the White\nHouse in 1997 and 2000. There have also been cases where medals\nwere rescinded and then reinstated, mistakenly awarded, and even\nabused by recipients. On rare occasions, the Medal of Honor has been issued for individual acts of bravery occurring during peacetime. Capt. Charles A. Lindbergh, for example, received the medal for\nhis “heroic courage and skills as a navigator, at the risk\nof his life, for his nonstop flight in his airplane from New York\nto Paris, France, 20-21 May 1927.\"","passages":[{"passage":"- Given the situation surrounding COVID-19, the Canadian Heritage Information Network is no longer able to follow up on the requests that will be submitted until further notice.

However, there are pitfalls along the way. Sometimes researchers want so much to find a person that they ignore facts and make inaccurate connections. This guide will help you ask the questions that will help you decide if a person is, in fact, your ancestor. As you compare what you already know about your ancestor against the new information you find in a record, you can decide whether you have located your ancestor. What You Are Looking For\nYou are trying to decide if the person you found in a record is your ancestor. Once you have found a person in a record who may be your ancestor, the following 5 steps will help you determine if you have, in fact, found your ancestor. Step 1. Review what you already know about your ancestor. Do the following to identify your ancestor clearly:\n- Make a time line, listing known facts about your ancestor. - On your time line, include other persons associated with your ancestor. - Briefly give the source of your information. - Use an analysis chart to identify and evaluate what you know. - Evaluate what that information may suggest. See the following time line for an example of known information:\n|Time Line for My Ancestor: Daniel Currie Hill|\n|Source: All information is from A Dictionary of Scottish Emigrants To Canada Before Confederation, vols. 1 & 2.|\n|1807 Apr 2||Daniel Currie Hill born Johnstone, Renfrew, Scotland, son of Alexander Hill and Elizabeth Currie.|\n|1821 Apr 28||Daniel sailed with his parents and brothers and sisters on the Earl of Buckinghamshire from Greenock for Canada.|\n|1833||Daniel married Elizabeth Bryce.|\n|1835||Daniel moved to Tosorontio Twp., Simcoe Co., Ontario.|\n|1840||Daniel and his extended family moved to Nauvoo, Illinois, United States.|\n|1881 Jul 21||Daniel Currie Hill died in Utah, United States.|\nFor help in making a time line, see Tip 1.

(Show a picture.) It is a very high hill. Very few hills in Ontario are high enough to be called mountains. How high must a hill be before it may be called a mountain? There is no fixed rule for using the term mountain. What is called a mountain in one part of the country would simply be called a hill in another. For example, in some localities a hill about 500 feet high is called a mountain; in other localities, it would need to be over 1,000 feet high to be considered as such. When we speak of the height of a mountain we mean its elevation above the level of the sea. Explain. Some mountains are so low and their slopes are so gentle that one may climb to their tops without much trouble. Others are so high and their sides are so steep that it is difficult and Often impossible to reach their tops. The height of the highest mountain in the world is about five and one-half miles. Their tops may rise far above the clouds and are often hidden by them. Examine as many pictures of mountains as you can find. What shape is the top of a mountain? It has many shapes—sometimes rounded, but often irregular. The top of a mountain that is much higher than the country about it is called a peak. What is the colour of the high mountain tops seen in pictures? Why are they white? They are covered with snow and ice. About two miles above us the atmosphere is so cold that snow will not melt. This is why very high mountain tops are always buried in snow and ice. A large mass of this snow and ice sometimes becomes loosened and slides down the mountain side causing great damage. This is called an avalanche. What name is given to a row of mountains? These ranges, or chains, are sometimes hundreds of miles in length. Why does such a mountain range make a good watershed, or divide? What becomes of the rain that falls upon a mountain range? Which side of the range will have the greater rainfall, the windward or the leeward side? Why? In what ways does a mountain range hinder trade and travel? Where is the best place for crossing a mountain range? What name is given to such a crossing place? It is called a pass. Why was this name given to it? Why do railways always cross mountains through these passes? Of what materials are mountains composed? Rock when exposed to the weather gradually crumbles away. What name is given to powdered rock? What becomes of the soil that is thus formed? Most of it is washed away and leaves the rocks bare; part of it covers the sides of the mountain farther down. This makes it possible for forests to grow on mountain sides. Do you see these forests in the pictures? Why can not trees grow on very high mountain tops? Metals, such as gold, silver, iron, etc., are usually found in rocks. Why are these metals so often found in mountainous countries? Why do fewer people live in mountainous countries than in lowland countries? How do mountaineers make their living? Do they cultivate the land much? Why not? They hunt, pasture sheep, work in mines, etc. What name is given to men who hunt? To those who care for sheep? To those who work in mines? Name some wild animals that live in the mountains. Why do many people go to the mountains for their health? Give reasons why most people find it more pleasant as well as more profitable to live in the valleys rather than up among the mountains? Make black-board sketches and sand and clay models of mountain, mountain range, pass, and valleys. Use -chalk dust to illustrate the snow-capped peaks. Make an examination of a brook near the school. Where does the water come from? Is there a spring, or a swamp, or a tile-drain in the neighbourhood? If so examine it carefully to find out what contribution, if any, it makes to the water-supply of the brook. In what direction is the brook flowing? Why does it flow in this direction? What is meant by the source of the brook? What is its mouth? What evidence can you find that the brook is growing larger as it flows along? What name is given to the smaller streams that flow into it? What is the name given to the land bordering each side of the brook?","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:45991a6c-6298-4630-a734-9cd9d6521a99>"]},{"passage":"The staff of the Historic Resources Management Branch wishes you a safe and joyous holiday season. We’ve worked hard to identify, protect and conserve Alberta’s historic resources this past year. We’d like to thank the countless people throughout Alberta for helping us to do that. Without your support, conserving our historic places would be impossible. RETROactive will be taking a break over the holidays — we will resume publishing on January 13th, 2014. We look forward to seeing you all in the New Year! An archaeological resource in Alberta is defined as “a work of humans that is of value for its prehistoric, historic, cultural or scientific significance” and is protected under the Historical Resources Act. Sites are classed into two major groups: prehistoric and historic. Over 80% of the sites in the province are prehistoric (which predate the arrival of Europeans); just over 10% are historic (postdating European arrival); and the rest are a mix of both prehistoric and historic, contemporary, indigenous historic (such as Metis sites), and natural sites. Some of the most common prehistoric sites are campsites; stone features; animal kill sites; processing sites; rock art sites and ceremonial sites, such as medicine wheels and cairns. Historic sites include trading posts, police posts, early settlements, homesteads, and industrial sites. Some of the oldest archaeological sites in Alberta date to as early as 13,000-8,000 years ago or what is known as the Palaeoindian Period. Prior to ~13,000 years ago what is now Alberta was covered by massive ice sheets that rendered the landscape uninhabitable. Shortly after the retreat of the ice sheets, however, animals and then people began moving into the area. At a site called Wally’s Beach in southern Alberta, archaeologists have recorded mammoth, camel and horse tracks. Not only that, they have discovered direct evidence of humans hunting these animals! Since then, what is now Alberta has been continuously occupied by numerous cultural groups, whose remnants we find in the form of discarded stone tools, butchered animal bones, hearths, broken pottery, buried palisade walls from forts and various other artifacts and features. These days the majority of new archaeological sites in Alberta are recorded by historic resource management consultants. Consulting companies are hired by developers in the province to carry out Historical Resource Impact Assessments, which involve the survey and testing of areas that will be affected by a proposed development for the potential or presence of archaeological sites. If a consultant deems an area to be high potential (judged by factors such as landforms, proximity to water bodies, and proximity to known sites, among other things) he or she will conduct surface inspection and possibly shovel testing (digging a hole about 40 cm by 40 cm in size) to search for archaeological artifacts or features. If results are positive, the information is submitted to the Archaeological Survey and a unique identifier, called a Borden number, is assigned to the site. The Archaeological Survey can then offer protection and management strategies for these sites. This could involve requirements for complete avoidance or excavation of the site prior to development. Archaeological site information is stored in the Alberta Archaeological Sites Inventory, an important resource for historic resource consultants and other researchers. Artifacts recovered from archaeological sites are stored at the Royal Alberta Museum where they are made accessible for research or put on display in one of their exhibits. Alberta’s archaeology may not be as visible as in other parts of the world, but we really do have a rich heritage and an abundance of archaeological resources — we just have to work a little harder to find them.

Except for the Order of Exceptional Merits each field has a slightly different medal design. - The Order for Exceptional Merits (Slovene: Red za izredne zasluge) is \"for exceptional work and services rendered in advancing the sovereignty, prosperity, renown and progress of Slovenia.\" It is a white, blue and gold medal with a red dot at the center, suspended from a gold and red ribbon pin. It includes a gold and red bar pin. - The Golden Order for Merits (Slovene: Zlati red za zasluge) is \"for exceptional merits accomplished for Slovenia.\" Its medal is the same as the Order of Exceptional Merits, but is suspended on a yellow ribbon pin. It includes a yellow bar pin in addition. - The Silver Order for Merits (Slovene: Srebrni red za zasluge) is \"for exceptional work and services rendered in the security, defence and protection of the Republic of Slovenia and for international cooperation in these fields.\" Its medal is similar to the Golden Order, but has silver backing and a silver center shield, and is suspended from a blue ribbon pin. It includes a blue bar pin. - The Order for Merits (Slovene: Red za zasluge) is \"for services accomplished for the Republic of Slovenia in other fields.\" Its medal is similar to the Silver Order, but lacks the silver backing. - The Medal for Merits (Slovene: Medalja za zasluge) is \"for especially remarkable achievements and results in the fields marking an important contribution to the development and international standing of the Republic of Slovenia.\" Its medal is white with a blue backing and silver center shield, suspended on a blue ribbon pin with three horizontal gold stripes. Its bar pin is blue with three vertical gold stripes. - The Medal for Valour (Slovene: Medalja za hrabrost) is \"for personal valour and self-sacrifice in saving human lives and material goods.\" Its medal and bar pin are similar to the Medal for Merits, but have only two gold stripes. It is the only honor that does not have a provision for being conferred upon foreign nationals or organisations. - The Medal for Honourable Action (Slovene: Medalja za častna dejanja) is \"for exceptional actions worthy of particular distinction.\"","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:c294cc97-cfc5-4d09-8d02-722f28cea566>"]},{"passage":"Valor is a gift. Those having it never\nknow for sure if they have it till the test comes. And those having\nit in one test never know for sure if they will have it when the\nnext test comes. For those who have valiantly engaged themselves\nin war, Sandburg’s reflections likely ring true. Bravery among\nenlisted personnel is not uncommon; it can be argued that all soldiers\ndemonstrate courage during combat, even if others never witness\nBut, there are great acts of military valor that\ndo not go unnoticed. These are recognized through the Medal of Honor—\npresented by the president in the name of Congress— the highest\nmilitary honor that can be bestowed upon any American. On December 9, 1861 Iowa Senator James W. Grimes\nintroduced S. No. 82 in the United States Senate, a bill designed\nto \"promote the efficiency of the Navy\" by authorizing\nthe production and distribution of \"medals of honor\". On December 21st the bill was passed, authorizing 200 such medals\nbe produced\" which shall be bestowed upon such petty officers,\nseamen, landsmen and marines as shall distinguish themselves by\ntheir gallantry in action and other seamanlike qualities during\nthe present war (Civil War).\" President Lincoln signed the\nbill and the (Navy) Medal of Honor was born. Two months later on February 17, 1862 Massachusetts\nSenator Henry Wilson introduced a similar bill, this one to authorize\n\"the President to distribute medals to privates in the Army\nof the United States who shall distinguish themselves in battle.\" Over the following months wording changed slightly as the bill made\nits way through Congress. When President Abraham Lincoln signed\nS.J.R. No 82 into law as 12 Stat. 623-624 on July 14, 1862, the\nArmy Medal of Honor was born. It read in part:\nResolved by the Senate and House of Representatives\nof the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the\nPresident of the United States be, and he is hereby, authorized\nto cause two thousand \"medals of honor\" to be prepared\nwith suitable emblematic devices, and to direct that the same be\npresented, in the name of the Congress, to such non--commissioned\nofficers and privates as shall most distinguish themselves by their\ngallantry in action, and other soldier-like qualities, during the\npresent insurrection (Civil War). Though there are myriad military heroes, many unsung,\nthe Medal of Honor sets specific provisions for recipients. At least\ntwo eyewitnesses must provide “incontestable evidence”\nto a deed that proves to “be so outstanding, that it clearly\ndistinguishes gallantry beyond the call of duty from lesser forms\nof bravery, involve the risk of life, and be the type of deed, which,\nif not done, would not subject the recipient to any unjustified\nThe correct title of the award is the Medal of Honor. Because the U.S. President presents the medal in the name of the\nUnited States Congress, it is sometimes called the Congressional\nMedal of Honor. The latter title is typically connected only with\nthe organization—the Congressional Medal of Honor Society—that\nrepresents those who have earned the medal. There are also\nthree medals for the Navy, Army, and Air Force. Conceived in 1860 and first awarded in 1863, the\nMedal of Honor has been awarded only 3,459 times to 3,440 recipients,\nalmost half of them Civil War soldiers. (There have been 19 double\nrecipients.) More than half of those who have received the Medal\nof Honor did not survive the action for which it was awarded. Over the years, the Medal of Honor’s parameters\nhave undergone revisions to ensure it is justly bestowed upon those\nwho merit it, even if this is done in a belated fashion. It took\nnearly 60 years, for example, for 29 African-American and Asian-American\nheroes to be recognized for their actions in World War II. They\nwere finally honored, many posthumously, at ceremonies at the White\nHouse in 1997 and 2000. There have also been cases where medals\nwere rescinded and then reinstated, mistakenly awarded, and even\nabused by recipients. On rare occasions, the Medal of Honor has been issued for individual acts of bravery occurring during peacetime. Capt. Charles A. Lindbergh, for example, received the medal for\nhis “heroic courage and skills as a navigator, at the risk\nof his life, for his nonstop flight in his airplane from New York\nto Paris, France, 20-21 May 1927.\"","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:595a6c81-eac7-49ff-9248-0631bc94f4cd>"]}]}

I realize that it’s probably because she just doesn’t know what to say, but I also have come to feel the frustration that comes with hearing the same response all the time. That’s when I began to think about why people say that they’re sorry, and I’ve come to realize that it’s probably one of the most over-used words. Why is it that we are at a loss for words, that we turn to an expression that is used to show sympathy or to apologize? Sorry is defined as feeling regret, sadness, and pity. The last thing that I want to feel is pity from anyone, but it still doesn’t answer the reason why sorry is so often overused. It’s a reflex that sends the wrong message. It’s not said that when we need to own up to being responsible for our actions, we rely on saying sorry to fill the gap of awkwardness when being told of news that affects someone else. Sorry finds its way into statements that don’t have anything to do with feeling remorse. One of the most concerning issues is that apologizing too much can lead to a person sounding insincere. As a strategy for being polite, sorry has become the go-to word for keeping the peace without sounding too passive-aggressive. By changing to words such as thank you, we immediately can change the tone of our message to one that is positive. Apologizing for simply existing isn’t enough. Instead, changing the words we use can make a difference in our conversations and our relationships with each other is more beneficial, and what is meant to be. Rather than staying in the habit of saying sorry, we can practice using words that give real meaning to what we are feeling and putting the unnecessary apologies away for when they are most needed. Over-apologizing has become a common way of reacting to those around us. What many may not realize is how we lessen its meaning and its value, the more that we say we’re sorry. It can also show low-esteem and that we fear confrontation. Remembering that unless we have done something that is our fault, finding words that express what the other person may need, such as encouragement, could be the better option than saying I’m sorry.\n\n‘I’m sorry.’ The two simple yet powerful words couples might have difficulty saying at the right time. As we all know, relationships aren’t perfect. This permits the possibility that sometimes, we might utter or do wrong and hurtful things to our partners. This means that once we hurt our spouse (whether deliberately or accidentally), their impact are bound to take effect on our loved one consequently, affecting the relationship. The remedy for doing wrong is by apologizing. But unfortunately, sincere apologies are tough to carry out. Thankfully, this step-by-step guide is all the difference to ace an apology game. Admit you’re wrong\nPerhaps one of the mistakes individuals make when apologizing, is refusing to admit their wrong doing. Selfishness, pride, and the need to always be right are a few flaws manifesting during an awful apology. Contrarily, when apologizing correctly, it is important to first admit the wrongful act. It doesn’t matter whether your mind keeps repeating how ‘totally right you handled the (wrongful) situation’. By humbling yourself and placing the happiness of your partner first, you can go about apologizing the right way. Take care to choose your words wisely. For instance, never say something silly like, ‘I apologize if the way I acted offended you’, or ‘I’m sorry that you think I did the wrong thing’. These two phrases although masked as apologies, simple denote that; ultimately you are right and your partner (is merely being dramatic) for finding your actions or words offensive. Try using more precise words or phrases expressing your acknowledgement of wrong-doing instead. For instance, saying, ‘I am sorry for the way I acted earlier’, or ‘I am sorry. I shouldn’t have said the things I said earlier.’ These phrases successfully convey that you have manned (or womaned) up to accept your errors. Admit that you hurt your partner’s feelings\nAfter you have passed through stage 1 successfully, your partner will need to hear that you also hurt their feelings. Remember you and your partner are a team hence, in communicating your apology, acknowledging both of you as major subjects in the matter is paramount. How exactly did you hurt your partner’s feelings? Was it what you said or did? Did you refer to them as ‘lazy’, ‘slow’, ‘stubborn’, etc. Did you passive-aggressively refuse to speak to them throughout the week and etcetera? Whatever it was, you have to openly admit to your spouse that although you said or did those things, you’re equally aware that their feelings were hurt. Remember, you cannot rebuild your relationship without first addressing those things that went collapsed (went wrong). Express your remorse sincerely\nTo express remorse typically means the manner in which you demonstrate your regretful acknowledgement of an offence you committed. Language, tone of voice, facial expression and body language must all play together in convincing your partner that you’re truly apologetic for failing them. It is for this reason that apologies to your spouse (no matter how little), must be done face-to-face. This way they can feel, sense and see the sincerity of your expression of regret. Offer to make amends\nOffering to make amends after an apology is different from buying your spouse’s affection. This simple difference is often misinterpreted by some couples making the error of trying to buy the affection of the offended partner through gifts,and cash. The aforementioned strategy is only short-lived with repercussions lasting for long. Instead try to make practical and sustainable amends. If you’re finding it difficult, ask your partner how you can make it up and down. If they however, insist you figure it out on your own, get to work and figure it out. Consult books and relationship experts to point you in the right direction. Do not impose forgiveness on your partner\nHaving practised stages 1 to 4, it’s only human that you expect your partner’s instant forgiveness. But this isn’t always the case. Just as individual faces differ, so also do their personality and consequently, their response to forgiveness. Should your partner not have admitted they have forgiven you, be patient. Never try to blackmail your partner emotionally to forgive you.\n\nThey're Not Just for Children\nWe learned them as children, but no mater your age these essential words are effortless to say and convey a wealth of meaning to others. They have a powerful ability to create positive interactions, so look for opportunities to use them every day. Using “please” expresses both respect and consideration for those with whom we’re interacting because it changes a command into a request. It sets the tone for whatever follows and is one of most important universal manners. “Thank You” and “You’re Welcome”\nMost people know to express their thanks for gifts, favors, awards, and the like. But we sometimes fail to recognize and show appreciation for the everyday courtesies that come our way, such as when someone holds the door or lets us go ahead in line. Expressing thanks for these little services is a hallmark of civility. When someone says, “thank you,” the best response is, “you’re welcome.” Don’t be bashful—accept the credit for your kindness. It’s subtle, but an “it was nothing” is actually saying that you place no value on what you did. By accepting thanks graciously you can also encourage the “thank-you” habit. “Excuse me,” “pardon me,” and “I beg your pardon” all express your awareness that you’ve inconvenienced someone else. Make it a habit to excuse yourself whenever you do the following:\n- Make a necessary interruption: “Excuse me, but you have a phone call.”\n- Make a request: “Excuse me, but this is the non-smoking section.”\n- Acknowledge an error: “Excuse me. I didn’t realize that you were already waiting in line.”\n- Acknowledge a faux pas, such as burping: “Excuse me.”\n- Leave a conversation: “Excuse me, I wish I could chat longer, but I have to leave now.”\n- Get up from the table: “Please excuse me.”\nMaking and accepting apologies gracefully are acts of courtesy and maturity, and they are important for matters both big and small. Sincere apologies can defuse volatile situations; it’s hard for most people to remain angry with someone who takes responsibility for his own actions. “I’m sorry” is also one of the simplest and often kindest ways to express sympathy or regret. A job loss, an illness, a death in the family, or the loss of a pet are all times when you might say sorry. At these times, keep it simple—you don’t need to elaborate if you aren’t sure what else to say.\n\nHow To Apologize\nA look into apologies from a neurological intelligence perspective\nWhen I was a kid I did not understand apologies very well. One time at an art day camp I told someone that their artwork looked ugly. He was so upset that he snitched to the camp leader, who made me apologize. I said sorry, and the kid was still upset. They told me to \"Say it like I mean it\" whatever that meant, so I changed my voice to make it sound pitiful and regretful and said sorry again. They preferred the second apology to the first, even though I wasn't any more sorry the second time. I did not learn to apologize better from that exchange, but I did learn that people care a lot and can be very particular about how you apologize. They care because an apology has a purpose. I now know that apologies are supposed to initiate, or facilitate the healing of a broken relationship. If your apology doesn't do that, then others won't accept it. While other people have a very specific expectation of what your apology should look like, you might have different reasons for wanting to apologize. Usually people apologize after they realize that their actions affect themselves or after they realize how their actions affected others. For example, when I hurt the kid's feelings I could have apologized out of fear of the punishment the camp instructor might give me, or I could have apologized because I realized how much I had hurt the kid. The first motivation does not make for a good apology because people want to believe that you care about them. In addition to looking at good and bad apologies we will also be looking at the 5 different methods of apologizing. These methods were found by marriage councilor Gary Chapman. He calls them the languages of apology; they are: expressing regret, restitution, requesting forgiveness, not doing it again, and accepting responsibility. He found these different types of apologies by interviewing people, and asking them \"if you were to apologize to someone how would you do it? \", and \"if someone were to apologize to you how would you want them to do it?\" It turns out that these different types of apologies are rooted in the ethics of neurological intelligence. You can read more about these in my post titled Meta Ethics. As a quick recap the theory states that there are two systems of ethics. The first states that ethical behavior is motivated by preserving or enhancing your identity. This theory is where bad apologies come from. The second states that ethical behavior comes from building or preserving your relationships, this is where good apologies come from. Both systems of ethics have six different ethical principles which define them. The sixth relationship ethic states that you need to show people mercy; one way to do this is through apologizing for the ways that you failed the other ethics. Therefore the sixth ethic is not an apology method, but apologizing itself. Similarly the sixth identity ethic is not a method of making a poor apology, but instead the motivation for making a poor apology. Language 1: Don't Do it Again\nWhen you stop doing something that is wrong you are following the social contracts ethic. This ethic states that the only way to keep people from taking advantage of each other is to make mutually beneficial social contracts. When you stop doing harmful things you show that you are capable of creating and keeping social contracts again. The identity ethic that corresponds to this is the values ethic. It states that the things you believe are right are what is right. If you stop doing the things that you believe are wrong this might be good or bad, that depends on whether you were right or not. But it is not necessarily an apology. For it to be an apology it would have to actually be benefiting others with your change of behavior. Language 2: Restitution\nRestitution means that you try to correct the bad thing you have done. It comes from the common good ethic, which states that in order to reap the greatest benefit from group living you must contribute to the common good of society. When you make restitution you show that what you have done has placed an additional burden on someone, and the only way to make that up is to contribute to them. Sometimes restitution means that our undue the thing that you did wrong. If you steal, then you return it; if you break something, then you replace it. However there are some things that you cannot undo.\n\nThursday, January 15, 2009\nI got this sweet but very sad picture (above) from a friend... It made me think about the word, SORRY. How many times a day do we\/I\/you use this word???? Sorry has all kinds of meanings:\n--Grieved for the loss of some good; pained for some evil; feeling regret; -- now generally used to express light grief or affliction, but formerly often used to express deeper feeling. --Melancholy; dismal; gloomy; mournful; (She is in a sorry mood today!) --Poor; mean; worthless; (That is a sorry excuse.). I can only speak for myself, but I know that I seem to constantly use the word.. I 'am' a pleaser --especially to my sweet husband, and whenever I think I've done (or do) something crazy or stupid, I apologize BIGTIME. \"I'm sorry that I walk so slowly.\" \"I am sorry that I complain about my aches and pains so much.\" I feel so sorry for you---having to put up with a moody female like me.\" Just think about it... I seem to apologize ALOT. Do you???? Then, there's always the problem when someone 'does' say \"I'm Sorry\" that makes one wonder if they really are sorry ---or whether they are just using words that mean nothing...???? An apology that means nothing is worse I think than no apology at all. Why is it that some people seem to apologize ALOT and others never seem to say \"I'm Sorry\"???? Maybe, saying \"I'm Sorry\" has a different meaning to some than it does to others. Maybe --some of the problem has to do with 'forgiveness' (which is another blog)! All of these thoughts made me do some research on the word, SORRY. I read on www.brainyquote.com MANY different quotes from people using the word, sorry. It's interesting how the word has so many meanings and interpretations. If you want to know who said some of these quotes listed below, click HERE. It is interesting! See if you can guess which one of these quotes was said by Monica Lewinsky. (Har Har)\n--I don't like it, and I'm sorry I ever had anything to do with it. --I can just tell you that I'm sorry for what happened, and I think people understand that. --Love is never having to say you are sorry. --Love in the real world means saying you're sorry 10 times a day. --And I felt sorry, and I have felt bad about what happened. --If love means never having to say you're sorry, then marriage means always having to say everything twice. --All successful people these days seem to be neurotic. Perhaps we should stop being sorry for them and start being sorry for me - for being so confounded normal. --There's no room in my life for feeling sorry for myself. --You may be sorry that you spoke, sorry you stayed or went, sorry you won or lost, sorry so much was spent. But as you go through life, you'll find - you're never sorry you were kind. --Grab a chance and you won't be sorry for a might-have-been. --Most truths are so naked that people feel sorry for them and cover them up, at least a little bit. --If you're going to do something tonight that you'll be sorry for tomorrow morning, sleep late. --Affliction comes to us, not to make us sad but sober; not to make us sorry but wise. --I can wholeheartedly apologize for not being at all sorry. And it really is the least I can do. --Let us live so that when we come to die even the undertaker will be sorry.\n\nIn these cases you contribute something else to the person you harmed. You can work it out with them to figure out what would be acceptable. You might also make restitution to show others that you are a good person. This line of thought comes from the virtue signaling ethic, and while it is great that you are doing the right thing, this is not the best way too apologize. It could lead you to think that you can just balance your bad deeds with good deeds, but this idea fails to strengthen the bonds that you have with others. Language 3: Request Forgiveness\nWhen you request forgiveness from someone you are showing them that their opinion really matters to you, and you want to rebuild the relationship that you have with them. This follows the negotiation ethic which states that you should change your social contracts in order to benefit everyone involved in them. When you request forgiveness you recognize that your actions went against the best interest of the person you wronged, and that you should have received their permission before acting. The autonomy ethic states that you should change your values in order to bolster your identity depending on each scenario. If you request forgiveness not because you care about what the other person thinks, but to avoid retribution from them, then you are following this ethic. This request for forgiveness is not a heartfelt apology because you are only thinking of yourself. Language 4: Accept Responsibility\nThe responsibility ethic states that you should change your social contracts in order to help the people you lead. When you accept the responsibility for your actions you try to manage the consequences of your actions. This shows the people that you have wronged that you still want to help them. You don't want your actions to be a burden to them. The branding ethic states that you should change your values in order to best embody the things you represent. If you take responsibility of your actions so that you can save your image this is a great thing to do, but it isn't a great apology. It shows people that you care about yourself more than the people that you harmed. Language 5: Expressing Regret\nWhen you express regret for your behavior you are being accountable to others. This follows the fifth relationship ethic which states that you must hold other people accountable for their actions by telling them how their actions have influenced others. When you express regret you tell the person you have wronged that you realize how much your actions have hurt them, and let them know that you wish you hadn't hurt them because of how much they mean to you. The self assessment ethic is the opposing ethic it states that you should evaluate your own behavior, and determine if it is actually beneficial to you. You might feel bad because you realize that your behavior is wrong and it is hurting you. But this regret is not an apology, because you don't have anyone to express it to. If you do express regret to someone because you realize that your actions are hurting yourself you will seem insincere. They will probably be like the kid with terrible drawing skills, and claim you aren't actually sorry, just sorry that your actions caught up to you. Although there are several ways to apologize, not all of the methods are necessary every time. For instance the kid whose feelings I hurt seemed to be fine after I expressed regret, and I stopped hurting his feelings. Something that I did not talk about is the relationship between personality, and apology methods. Gary Chapman's work focusses on this topic a lot, and suggests that for some people one of the apology methods will resonate with them far better than the others. One other thing that I wanted to point out is that the different apology methods are also the steps of repentance. So repentance is making an apology to God for the sins that you committed against Him. Its purpose is to initiate the rebuilding of your relationship with God. If done properly both repentance and apologizing will lead you to become a better person, and they will allow God and others to regain their trust in you.\n\nRecently, I've heard a slew of apologies. Paula Deen said “sorry” for her racist behavior, Anthony Weiner took responsibility (kind of) for airing his privates once again, Riley Cooper swore he’d learned from his racist mistakes, and the barista at my local coffee shop apologized profusely for not having the coffee flavor I love. It seems like everyone — celebrities and regular Joes and Janes alike — has apology fever. In fact, some psychologists and business experts note the U.S. has developed what they dub an “apology culture,” in which people of all professions, from CEOs to physicians, are apologizing more frequently. Blame lawsuit culture, a society based on shame, or whatever you will: Everybody’s doing it. But do apologies actually help reconcile hurt feelings, or can they make things worse? Is there a “right” or “wrong” way to deliver an apology? Science helps us navigate America’s newest hobby. The Right Way to Say It\nWhether it’s via an appearance on a morning news show, a dozen long-stemmed roses, or standing outside someone’s window with a boom box blaring Akon’s Put the Blame on Me, there are approximately a million ways to apologize. But, as we’ve learned from both public figures (think Mel Gibson and Anthony Weiner) and, most likely, our own personal experiences, not all apologies are equally effective. Unfortunately, experts haven't settled on one specific set of criteria for the \"perfect apology\". Some sources maintain there are four key components to an apology, while others claim as many as seven factors must be present in order for an apology to work. What each of these theories has in common is the idea that a meaningful apology should include clear acknowledgment and explanation of the offense, an expression of regret or shame, and a commitment to making reparations or providing compensation (whether monetary or symbolic). This doesn’t seem like rocket science, but, in fact, many apologies lack even these basic parts. When Serena Williams blasted a line judge about an unfair call at the 2009 U.S. Open, her apology was everything but apologetic, lacking a clear statement of regret and failing to address the line judge’s feelings. Though Paula Deen’s first apology was a tearful cry for forgiveness, by generalizing her actions as “mistakes I have made” and the “wrong that I have done,” she failed to say what she’s sorry for and acknowledge the feelings of the offended parties. Of course, we can't know whether the offended parties appreciated the apologies regardless. But what these examples highlight is the fact that it's easy to overlook some of the core factors in what research dubs the most meaningful \"sorry\". An apology doesn’t have to be an elaborate song and dance, but the most effective ones take more than just slapping together a few slick words and shedding some tears. Better Safe and Sorry\nEven if saying “sorry” is a little tough, owning up to mistakes yields some pretty great perks. Research has found that apologies promote reconciliation between the two quarreling parties and can restore trust when the offender takes responsibility for their actions Removing the shadow of suspicion: the effects of apology versus denial for repairing competence-versus integrity-based trust violations.

They had “did you know” trivia posters, intriguing anagrams, upside down cryptographic pieces, comical posters, creative gender indicators on the restrooms, charts of important financial tips from Warren Buffet, and even the most important “warning” signs were amusing. What caught my eye that day was a sign that read, “3 Steps to Apologies.”\nThat last one was awesome, but more about that in a moment…\nFirst, what is accountability??? In the simplest of definitions when you break it down, it is the ability to share an accounting of the facts. In today’s world, being accountable, forgiving, and loving have gotten all sorts of twisted and broken because they have been warped by the energy of striving and needing to not be “bad.” People are incredibly reluctant to be accountable and many are unwilling to apologize. In this energy, relationships are crashing all around us and people are pointing fingers outward in defense of, “But! It’s not my fault!! !” Being accountable is a practice of being fully present. I recently experienced a situation with a loved one that crushed my heart. It left me frustrated and floundering, as I attempted to express myself consciously and coherently, trying to convey to him my experience of his actions. We had many discussions where he kept approaching me, trying to get me to understand his point of view, without realizing that I did understand it. I was hearing his complaints and his frustrations, but he wasn’t willing to be accountable for his part of the breakdown. He was, and still is, unwilling to make an accounting of the hurt he dealt me, brushing it off with vague statements like, “Everyone is wrong in this situation,” and “no one is willing to make a bridge.” He continues to deflect his part in it, pointing outward, and missing the point all together: I do want to build a bridge and heal the relationship, but I cannot because he is not present to do so. With every situation you encounter, if you are unwilling to look at your own part in it, you add to the tension on the planet and you destroy your relationship connection. Every time you refuse to hear how your words and actions have hurt another, every time you are unwilling to be accountable for your part, every time you point your finger at “everyone else” in the situation, you are compounding the problem in the world. If someone is saying to you, “You’re not hearing me!” Take a deep breath, stop everything, and hear them. Then be accountable for your external words and actions. Also, take into account your internal thoughts and emotions, and get clear with that person. Without exception, get clear, especially if this is a relationship you want to hold onto. Often, getting clear means you need to apologize. So… what does that mean? An apology, according to dictionary.com is: a written or spoken expression of one’s regret, remorse, or sorrow for having insulted, failed, injured, or wronged another. It does not mean you’re a “sorry person” or somehow less than everyone else when you apologize. It means you are recognizing that you have caused another pain. It means you’ve been human and are being accountable for that. Maybe you don’t know how to apologize or maybe you think you’ve apologized, but the other person is saying you haven’t. Have you missed a step, maybe? Back to the sandwich shop sign…\nThe first step to apologizing is… are you ready? BE ACCOUNTABLE! This means noticing that you’ve hurt another. This means that you’re hearing them when they say, “You hurt me.” This means you recognize that your words and actions caused someone pain. If you did it on accident, didn’t “mean to” hurt them, or were completely unaware that you had done or said something that could hurt, then listen to them when they say they are hurting. And, perhaps they don’t say it out loud, but I’m willing to bet that you can tell when your loved one is bothered by something. Listen to their actions too. Being accountable means you actually say the words and give an accounting of the facts.\n\nIf you have ever been offended, chances are you already know how far a simple apology can go toward restoring a strained relationship. Unfortunately, it's not always easy to offer an apology or to admit that we have done something wrong. Some people seem to have a more difficult time than others do when it comes to acknowledging their faults and making amends. Many factors -- including our upbringing, age, gender, personalities, geographic location, religious or spiritual beliefs, and culture -- can influence how skilled and comfortable we are in apologizing for our actions. This guide provides some tips for offering an effective apology. What is An Apology? An apology is a statement that expresses regret over an action or asks pardon for a fault or offense. An effective apology both acknowledges responsibility and expresses remorse. Statements such as \"I am very sorry,\" \"How can I make up for this?\" and \"I won't ever do that again\" are examples of the ways in which we can admit that we are at fault and that we regret our actions. Good apologies can prevent small problems from escalating and are a useful tool in conflict resolution. An effective apology -- one that is thoughtful, genuine and timely – can eases tension, restores trust, and benefits both parties. On the other hand, an insincere apology can make matters worse. Most people can sense when someone is being insincere and they may become even more offended than they initially were. When people feel that they have been wronged and fail to receive the apology they deserve, they often continue to feel hurt and resentment and are more likely to seek revenge or punishment. As you might imagine, it becomes much more difficult to resolve the offense and to move forward. How to Offer An Apology\nAre you involved in a conflict in which you must apologize to someone? Here are some elements you might want to include. - Acknowledge what you did. \"I arrived an hour late for our meeting and did not make my presentation.\" - Take responsibility for your actions and admit that you made a mistake or behaved inappropriately. \"I know that people were counting on me to describe our project. It was my responsibility to let people know that I was running late. I know that I was wrong.\" - Acknowledge the impact that your actions may have had on other people. This might include bruised feelings, inconvenience, stress, or other costs. \"My absence created a great deal of confusion among the other team members, made us appear to be disorganized, and meant that everyone had to work later.\" - Apologize for having caused pain or having done damage. \"I am sorry for the inconvenience I caused and for placing the project in jeopardy.\" - Repair the damage and state your future intentions. An effective apology must include corrective action and convey your desire not to repeat this mistake. \"I would like to make up for my absence by sending everyone a written copy of my presentation. In the future, I will notify people that I may be late and will arrange to have someone cover for me in my absence.\" One of the quickest ways to ruin a perfectly good apology is to offer an excuse or try to cast blame somewhere else. When we err, we sometimes find it easier to offer excuses or to try to justify our actions than to say we are sorry. Excuses such as \"I wasn't feeling well,\" and \"the phone was busy,\" allow us to avoid blame. Although we may acknowledge that a mistake occurred, excuses enable us to deny responsibility for the mistake. \"But It's Much More Complicated...\"\nMost of us, at one time or another, have encountered complex situations in which multiple persons share responsibility for having contributed to a problem. We not only need to offer an apology, we expect to receive an apology from another person. At other times, we may believe that we have not done anything wrong and, consequently, are reluctant to apologize. In these complex situations, conversations between the involved persons might help to clarify each person's concerns and feelings.

We all make mistakes and sometimes hurt the people in our lives that we care about. One of the best ways to fix things, is by simply apologizing from our hearts. Of course, poems help us express and understand how we feel. In celebration of that, reading famous short poems can tug at your heart strings. Best I’m Sorry Poems\nI just feel so much guilt,\nThat my words and actions built. I know, what I did was wrong,\nTried to avoid it, and be strong. Following me has been the truth,\nIt was hurting like a tooth. A second more, I could not deny,\nNot apologizing was a lie. I’m so sorry, from deep inside,\nClearly guilty, my hands are tied. It was obviously, all my fault,\nI have opened my inner vault. To be one with each other\nWhat greater thing is there for two human souls\nthan to feel that they are joined together to strengthen\neach other in all labor, to minister to each other in all sorrow,\nto share with each other in all gladness,\nto be one with each other in the\nsilent unspoken memories? ~ George Eliot\nThe following poem by Elizabeth Barrett Browning is a well-known standard that has helped to mend many relationship fences. It’s been around for ages because it’s so perfect for so many ‘apology’ related reasons…\nHow Do I Love Thee? How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height\nMy soul can reach, when feeling out of sight\nFor the ends of Being and ideal Grace. I love thee to the level of everyday’s\nMost quiet need, by sun and candlelight. I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;\nI love thee purely, as they turn from Praise. I love thee with the passion put to use\nIn my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith. I love thee with a love I seemed to lose\nWith my lost saints,–I love thee with the breath,\nSmiles, tears, of all my life!–and, if God choose,\nI shall but love thee better after death. True friendship is a gift\nOh so precious and so rare\nSometimes we take it for granted\nSometimes we do despair\nOur fault is being human\nMistakes are everywhere\nPlease let me not lose the gift\nThat is so precious and so rare. I am sorry to hurt your feelings my love\nI should have kept my promises as I have told you\nBut I don’t know the reason why I did wrong to you\nI felt sad when I show your tears rolling on your cheeks\nI know you are very upset over me\nand don’t want to talk to me either\nIf you feel that I had hurt you by unpleasant words\nthen please forgive me and accept my sorry\nDo not stop talking to me my love\nIf you do so, my heart will burst into thousand pieces\nYou know how much I am in love with you\nand without you my loneliness will take me to hell\nAlways, there is a special place in my heart for you\nwhere my love for you is so passionate and true\nNo one can melt my heart like you do\nnor clutch my soul to give me new life-like you\nMy love, please talk to me again\nand I promise your love in my life\nwill be pleasant until my end. Please give me a chance to explain,\nWhat I did was completely vain. It was clearly way beyond rude,\nCompletely stupid, I must conclude. I used words, I did not mean,\nI need to stop – acting fifteen. My actions and words, simply not right\nI’m sorry for my anger and spite. Please give me a chance to explain,\nThere must be something wrong with my brain. My emotions, I must learn to control,\nAnd never hurt you, this is my goal. There’s one sad truth in life I’ve found\nWhile journeying east and west –\nThe only folks we really wound\nAre those we love the best. We flatter those we scarcely know,\nWe please the fleeting guest,\nAnd deal full many a thoughtless blow\nTo those who love us best.","passages":[{"passage":"One of my friends always says “I’m sorry.” It doesn’t matter what I say, but for whatever her reasons are, she only answers with sorry. I realize that it’s probably because she just doesn’t know what to say, but I also have come to feel the frustration that comes with hearing the same response all the time. That’s when I began to think about why people say that they’re sorry, and I’ve come to realize that it’s probably one of the most over-used words. Why is it that we are at a loss for words, that we turn to an expression that is used to show sympathy or to apologize? Sorry is defined as feeling regret, sadness, and pity. The last thing that I want to feel is pity from anyone, but it still doesn’t answer the reason why sorry is so often overused. It’s a reflex that sends the wrong message. It’s not said that when we need to own up to being responsible for our actions, we rely on saying sorry to fill the gap of awkwardness when being told of news that affects someone else. Sorry finds its way into statements that don’t have anything to do with feeling remorse. One of the most concerning issues is that apologizing too much can lead to a person sounding insincere. As a strategy for being polite, sorry has become the go-to word for keeping the peace without sounding too passive-aggressive. By changing to words such as thank you, we immediately can change the tone of our message to one that is positive. Apologizing for simply existing isn’t enough. Instead, changing the words we use can make a difference in our conversations and our relationships with each other is more beneficial, and what is meant to be. Rather than staying in the habit of saying sorry, we can practice using words that give real meaning to what we are feeling and putting the unnecessary apologies away for when they are most needed. Over-apologizing has become a common way of reacting to those around us. What many may not realize is how we lessen its meaning and its value, the more that we say we’re sorry. It can also show low-esteem and that we fear confrontation. Remembering that unless we have done something that is our fault, finding words that express what the other person may need, such as encouragement, could be the better option than saying I’m sorry.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:2680b94a-483d-43fa-98fb-4a3dbf1ac6a3>"]},{"passage":"‘I’m sorry.’ The two simple yet powerful words couples might have difficulty saying at the right time. As we all know, relationships aren’t perfect. This permits the possibility that sometimes, we might utter or do wrong and hurtful things to our partners. This means that once we hurt our spouse (whether deliberately or accidentally), their impact are bound to take effect on our loved one consequently, affecting the relationship. The remedy for doing wrong is by apologizing. But unfortunately, sincere apologies are tough to carry out. Thankfully, this step-by-step guide is all the difference to ace an apology game. Admit you’re wrong\nPerhaps one of the mistakes individuals make when apologizing, is refusing to admit their wrong doing. Selfishness, pride, and the need to always be right are a few flaws manifesting during an awful apology. Contrarily, when apologizing correctly, it is important to first admit the wrongful act. It doesn’t matter whether your mind keeps repeating how ‘totally right you handled the (wrongful) situation’. By humbling yourself and placing the happiness of your partner first, you can go about apologizing the right way. Take care to choose your words wisely. For instance, never say something silly like, ‘I apologize if the way I acted offended you’, or ‘I’m sorry that you think I did the wrong thing’. These two phrases although masked as apologies, simple denote that; ultimately you are right and your partner (is merely being dramatic) for finding your actions or words offensive. Try using more precise words or phrases expressing your acknowledgement of wrong-doing instead. For instance, saying, ‘I am sorry for the way I acted earlier’, or ‘I am sorry. I shouldn’t have said the things I said earlier.’ These phrases successfully convey that you have manned (or womaned) up to accept your errors. Admit that you hurt your partner’s feelings\nAfter you have passed through stage 1 successfully, your partner will need to hear that you also hurt their feelings. Remember you and your partner are a team hence, in communicating your apology, acknowledging both of you as major subjects in the matter is paramount. How exactly did you hurt your partner’s feelings? Was it what you said or did? Did you refer to them as ‘lazy’, ‘slow’, ‘stubborn’, etc. Did you passive-aggressively refuse to speak to them throughout the week and etcetera? Whatever it was, you have to openly admit to your spouse that although you said or did those things, you’re equally aware that their feelings were hurt. Remember, you cannot rebuild your relationship without first addressing those things that went collapsed (went wrong). Express your remorse sincerely\nTo express remorse typically means the manner in which you demonstrate your regretful acknowledgement of an offence you committed. Language, tone of voice, facial expression and body language must all play together in convincing your partner that you’re truly apologetic for failing them. It is for this reason that apologies to your spouse (no matter how little), must be done face-to-face. This way they can feel, sense and see the sincerity of your expression of regret. Offer to make amends\nOffering to make amends after an apology is different from buying your spouse’s affection. This simple difference is often misinterpreted by some couples making the error of trying to buy the affection of the offended partner through gifts,and cash. The aforementioned strategy is only short-lived with repercussions lasting for long. Instead try to make practical and sustainable amends. If you’re finding it difficult, ask your partner how you can make it up and down. If they however, insist you figure it out on your own, get to work and figure it out. Consult books and relationship experts to point you in the right direction. Do not impose forgiveness on your partner\nHaving practised stages 1 to 4, it’s only human that you expect your partner’s instant forgiveness. But this isn’t always the case. Just as individual faces differ, so also do their personality and consequently, their response to forgiveness. Should your partner not have admitted they have forgiven you, be patient. Never try to blackmail your partner emotionally to forgive you.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:da4d6207-49c9-46e9-b2a7-c82967c3af5b>"]},{"passage":"They're Not Just for Children\nWe learned them as children, but no mater your age these essential words are effortless to say and convey a wealth of meaning to others. They have a powerful ability to create positive interactions, so look for opportunities to use them every day. Using “please” expresses both respect and consideration for those with whom we’re interacting because it changes a command into a request. It sets the tone for whatever follows and is one of most important universal manners. “Thank You” and “You’re Welcome”\nMost people know to express their thanks for gifts, favors, awards, and the like. But we sometimes fail to recognize and show appreciation for the everyday courtesies that come our way, such as when someone holds the door or lets us go ahead in line. Expressing thanks for these little services is a hallmark of civility. When someone says, “thank you,” the best response is, “you’re welcome.” Don’t be bashful—accept the credit for your kindness. It’s subtle, but an “it was nothing” is actually saying that you place no value on what you did. By accepting thanks graciously you can also encourage the “thank-you” habit. “Excuse me,” “pardon me,” and “I beg your pardon” all express your awareness that you’ve inconvenienced someone else. Make it a habit to excuse yourself whenever you do the following:\n- Make a necessary interruption: “Excuse me, but you have a phone call.”\n- Make a request: “Excuse me, but this is the non-smoking section.”\n- Acknowledge an error: “Excuse me. I didn’t realize that you were already waiting in line.”\n- Acknowledge a faux pas, such as burping: “Excuse me.”\n- Leave a conversation: “Excuse me, I wish I could chat longer, but I have to leave now.”\n- Get up from the table: “Please excuse me.”\nMaking and accepting apologies gracefully are acts of courtesy and maturity, and they are important for matters both big and small. Sincere apologies can defuse volatile situations; it’s hard for most people to remain angry with someone who takes responsibility for his own actions. “I’m sorry” is also one of the simplest and often kindest ways to express sympathy or regret. A job loss, an illness, a death in the family, or the loss of a pet are all times when you might say sorry. At these times, keep it simple—you don’t need to elaborate if you aren’t sure what else to say.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:4212f736-c2ac-463d-bdad-c0af2f2ae6b1>"]},{"passage":"How To Apologize\nA look into apologies from a neurological intelligence perspective\nWhen I was a kid I did not understand apologies very well. One time at an art day camp I told someone that their artwork looked ugly. He was so upset that he snitched to the camp leader, who made me apologize. I said sorry, and the kid was still upset. They told me to \"Say it like I mean it\" whatever that meant, so I changed my voice to make it sound pitiful and regretful and said sorry again. They preferred the second apology to the first, even though I wasn't any more sorry the second time. I did not learn to apologize better from that exchange, but I did learn that people care a lot and can be very particular about how you apologize. They care because an apology has a purpose. I now know that apologies are supposed to initiate, or facilitate the healing of a broken relationship. If your apology doesn't do that, then others won't accept it. While other people have a very specific expectation of what your apology should look like, you might have different reasons for wanting to apologize. Usually people apologize after they realize that their actions affect themselves or after they realize how their actions affected others. For example, when I hurt the kid's feelings I could have apologized out of fear of the punishment the camp instructor might give me, or I could have apologized because I realized how much I had hurt the kid. The first motivation does not make for a good apology because people want to believe that you care about them. In addition to looking at good and bad apologies we will also be looking at the 5 different methods of apologizing. These methods were found by marriage councilor Gary Chapman. He calls them the languages of apology; they are: expressing regret, restitution, requesting forgiveness, not doing it again, and accepting responsibility. He found these different types of apologies by interviewing people, and asking them \"if you were to apologize to someone how would you do it? \", and \"if someone were to apologize to you how would you want them to do it?\" It turns out that these different types of apologies are rooted in the ethics of neurological intelligence. You can read more about these in my post titled Meta Ethics. As a quick recap the theory states that there are two systems of ethics. The first states that ethical behavior is motivated by preserving or enhancing your identity. This theory is where bad apologies come from. The second states that ethical behavior comes from building or preserving your relationships, this is where good apologies come from. Both systems of ethics have six different ethical principles which define them. The sixth relationship ethic states that you need to show people mercy; one way to do this is through apologizing for the ways that you failed the other ethics. Therefore the sixth ethic is not an apology method, but apologizing itself. Similarly the sixth identity ethic is not a method of making a poor apology, but instead the motivation for making a poor apology. Language 1: Don't Do it Again\nWhen you stop doing something that is wrong you are following the social contracts ethic. This ethic states that the only way to keep people from taking advantage of each other is to make mutually beneficial social contracts. When you stop doing harmful things you show that you are capable of creating and keeping social contracts again. The identity ethic that corresponds to this is the values ethic. It states that the things you believe are right are what is right. If you stop doing the things that you believe are wrong this might be good or bad, that depends on whether you were right or not. But it is not necessarily an apology. For it to be an apology it would have to actually be benefiting others with your change of behavior. Language 2: Restitution\nRestitution means that you try to correct the bad thing you have done. It comes from the common good ethic, which states that in order to reap the greatest benefit from group living you must contribute to the common good of society. When you make restitution you show that what you have done has placed an additional burden on someone, and the only way to make that up is to contribute to them. Sometimes restitution means that our undue the thing that you did wrong. If you steal, then you return it; if you break something, then you replace it. However there are some things that you cannot undo.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:16d71ef5-af12-46b7-9ec7-8a325f574615>"]},{"passage":"Thursday, January 15, 2009\nI got this sweet but very sad picture (above) from a friend... It made me think about the word, SORRY. How many times a day do we\/I\/you use this word???? Sorry has all kinds of meanings:\n--Grieved for the loss of some good; pained for some evil; feeling regret; -- now generally used to express light grief or affliction, but formerly often used to express deeper feeling. --Melancholy; dismal; gloomy; mournful; (She is in a sorry mood today!) --Poor; mean; worthless; (That is a sorry excuse.). I can only speak for myself, but I know that I seem to constantly use the word.. I 'am' a pleaser --especially to my sweet husband, and whenever I think I've done (or do) something crazy or stupid, I apologize BIGTIME. \"I'm sorry that I walk so slowly.\" \"I am sorry that I complain about my aches and pains so much.\" I feel so sorry for you---having to put up with a moody female like me.\" Just think about it... I seem to apologize ALOT. Do you???? Then, there's always the problem when someone 'does' say \"I'm Sorry\" that makes one wonder if they really are sorry ---or whether they are just using words that mean nothing...???? An apology that means nothing is worse I think than no apology at all. Why is it that some people seem to apologize ALOT and others never seem to say \"I'm Sorry\"???? Maybe, saying \"I'm Sorry\" has a different meaning to some than it does to others. Maybe --some of the problem has to do with 'forgiveness' (which is another blog)! All of these thoughts made me do some research on the word, SORRY. I read on www.brainyquote.com MANY different quotes from people using the word, sorry. It's interesting how the word has so many meanings and interpretations. If you want to know who said some of these quotes listed below, click HERE. It is interesting! See if you can guess which one of these quotes was said by Monica Lewinsky. (Har Har)\n--I don't like it, and I'm sorry I ever had anything to do with it. --I can just tell you that I'm sorry for what happened, and I think people understand that. --Love is never having to say you are sorry. --Love in the real world means saying you're sorry 10 times a day. --And I felt sorry, and I have felt bad about what happened. --If love means never having to say you're sorry, then marriage means always having to say everything twice. --All successful people these days seem to be neurotic. Perhaps we should stop being sorry for them and start being sorry for me - for being so confounded normal. --There's no room in my life for feeling sorry for myself. --You may be sorry that you spoke, sorry you stayed or went, sorry you won or lost, sorry so much was spent. But as you go through life, you'll find - you're never sorry you were kind. --Grab a chance and you won't be sorry for a might-have-been. --Most truths are so naked that people feel sorry for them and cover them up, at least a little bit. --If you're going to do something tonight that you'll be sorry for tomorrow morning, sleep late. --Affliction comes to us, not to make us sad but sober; not to make us sorry but wise. --I can wholeheartedly apologize for not being at all sorry. And it really is the least I can do. --Let us live so that when we come to die even the undertaker will be sorry.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:97ef48a5-9630-4b7f-bc9f-b1af6ef053cb>"]},{"passage":"In these cases you contribute something else to the person you harmed. You can work it out with them to figure out what would be acceptable. You might also make restitution to show others that you are a good person. This line of thought comes from the virtue signaling ethic, and while it is great that you are doing the right thing, this is not the best way too apologize. It could lead you to think that you can just balance your bad deeds with good deeds, but this idea fails to strengthen the bonds that you have with others. Language 3: Request Forgiveness\nWhen you request forgiveness from someone you are showing them that their opinion really matters to you, and you want to rebuild the relationship that you have with them. This follows the negotiation ethic which states that you should change your social contracts in order to benefit everyone involved in them. When you request forgiveness you recognize that your actions went against the best interest of the person you wronged, and that you should have received their permission before acting. The autonomy ethic states that you should change your values in order to bolster your identity depending on each scenario. If you request forgiveness not because you care about what the other person thinks, but to avoid retribution from them, then you are following this ethic. This request for forgiveness is not a heartfelt apology because you are only thinking of yourself. Language 4: Accept Responsibility\nThe responsibility ethic states that you should change your social contracts in order to help the people you lead. When you accept the responsibility for your actions you try to manage the consequences of your actions. This shows the people that you have wronged that you still want to help them. You don't want your actions to be a burden to them. The branding ethic states that you should change your values in order to best embody the things you represent. If you take responsibility of your actions so that you can save your image this is a great thing to do, but it isn't a great apology. It shows people that you care about yourself more than the people that you harmed. Language 5: Expressing Regret\nWhen you express regret for your behavior you are being accountable to others. This follows the fifth relationship ethic which states that you must hold other people accountable for their actions by telling them how their actions have influenced others. When you express regret you tell the person you have wronged that you realize how much your actions have hurt them, and let them know that you wish you hadn't hurt them because of how much they mean to you. The self assessment ethic is the opposing ethic it states that you should evaluate your own behavior, and determine if it is actually beneficial to you. You might feel bad because you realize that your behavior is wrong and it is hurting you. But this regret is not an apology, because you don't have anyone to express it to. If you do express regret to someone because you realize that your actions are hurting yourself you will seem insincere. They will probably be like the kid with terrible drawing skills, and claim you aren't actually sorry, just sorry that your actions caught up to you. Although there are several ways to apologize, not all of the methods are necessary every time. For instance the kid whose feelings I hurt seemed to be fine after I expressed regret, and I stopped hurting his feelings. Something that I did not talk about is the relationship between personality, and apology methods. Gary Chapman's work focusses on this topic a lot, and suggests that for some people one of the apology methods will resonate with them far better than the others. One other thing that I wanted to point out is that the different apology methods are also the steps of repentance. So repentance is making an apology to God for the sins that you committed against Him. Its purpose is to initiate the rebuilding of your relationship with God. If done properly both repentance and apologizing will lead you to become a better person, and they will allow God and others to regain their trust in you.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:16d71ef5-af12-46b7-9ec7-8a325f574615>"]},{"passage":"Recently, I've heard a slew of apologies. Paula Deen said “sorry” for her racist behavior, Anthony Weiner took responsibility (kind of) for airing his privates once again, Riley Cooper swore he’d learned from his racist mistakes, and the barista at my local coffee shop apologized profusely for not having the coffee flavor I love. It seems like everyone — celebrities and regular Joes and Janes alike — has apology fever. In fact, some psychologists and business experts note the U.S. has developed what they dub an “apology culture,” in which people of all professions, from CEOs to physicians, are apologizing more frequently. Blame lawsuit culture, a society based on shame, or whatever you will: Everybody’s doing it. But do apologies actually help reconcile hurt feelings, or can they make things worse? Is there a “right” or “wrong” way to deliver an apology? Science helps us navigate America’s newest hobby. The Right Way to Say It\nWhether it’s via an appearance on a morning news show, a dozen long-stemmed roses, or standing outside someone’s window with a boom box blaring Akon’s Put the Blame on Me, there are approximately a million ways to apologize. But, as we’ve learned from both public figures (think Mel Gibson and Anthony Weiner) and, most likely, our own personal experiences, not all apologies are equally effective. Unfortunately, experts haven't settled on one specific set of criteria for the \"perfect apology\". Some sources maintain there are four key components to an apology, while others claim as many as seven factors must be present in order for an apology to work. What each of these theories has in common is the idea that a meaningful apology should include clear acknowledgment and explanation of the offense, an expression of regret or shame, and a commitment to making reparations or providing compensation (whether monetary or symbolic). This doesn’t seem like rocket science, but, in fact, many apologies lack even these basic parts. When Serena Williams blasted a line judge about an unfair call at the 2009 U.S. Open, her apology was everything but apologetic, lacking a clear statement of regret and failing to address the line judge’s feelings. Though Paula Deen’s first apology was a tearful cry for forgiveness, by generalizing her actions as “mistakes I have made” and the “wrong that I have done,” she failed to say what she’s sorry for and acknowledge the feelings of the offended parties. Of course, we can't know whether the offended parties appreciated the apologies regardless. But what these examples highlight is the fact that it's easy to overlook some of the core factors in what research dubs the most meaningful \"sorry\". An apology doesn’t have to be an elaborate song and dance, but the most effective ones take more than just slapping together a few slick words and shedding some tears. Better Safe and Sorry\nEven if saying “sorry” is a little tough, owning up to mistakes yields some pretty great perks. Research has found that apologies promote reconciliation between the two quarreling parties and can restore trust when the offender takes responsibility for their actions Removing the shadow of suspicion: the effects of apology versus denial for repairing competence-versus integrity-based trust violations.

They had “did you know” trivia posters, intriguing anagrams, upside down cryptographic pieces, comical posters, creative gender indicators on the restrooms, charts of important financial tips from Warren Buffet, and even the most important “warning” signs were amusing. What caught my eye that day was a sign that read, “3 Steps to Apologies.”\nThat last one was awesome, but more about that in a moment…\nFirst, what is accountability??? In the simplest of definitions when you break it down, it is the ability to share an accounting of the facts. In today’s world, being accountable, forgiving, and loving have gotten all sorts of twisted and broken because they have been warped by the energy of striving and needing to not be “bad.” People are incredibly reluctant to be accountable and many are unwilling to apologize. In this energy, relationships are crashing all around us and people are pointing fingers outward in defense of, “But! It’s not my fault!! !” Being accountable is a practice of being fully present. I recently experienced a situation with a loved one that crushed my heart. It left me frustrated and floundering, as I attempted to express myself consciously and coherently, trying to convey to him my experience of his actions. We had many discussions where he kept approaching me, trying to get me to understand his point of view, without realizing that I did understand it. I was hearing his complaints and his frustrations, but he wasn’t willing to be accountable for his part of the breakdown. He was, and still is, unwilling to make an accounting of the hurt he dealt me, brushing it off with vague statements like, “Everyone is wrong in this situation,” and “no one is willing to make a bridge.” He continues to deflect his part in it, pointing outward, and missing the point all together: I do want to build a bridge and heal the relationship, but I cannot because he is not present to do so. With every situation you encounter, if you are unwilling to look at your own part in it, you add to the tension on the planet and you destroy your relationship connection. Every time you refuse to hear how your words and actions have hurt another, every time you are unwilling to be accountable for your part, every time you point your finger at “everyone else” in the situation, you are compounding the problem in the world. If someone is saying to you, “You’re not hearing me!” Take a deep breath, stop everything, and hear them. Then be accountable for your external words and actions. Also, take into account your internal thoughts and emotions, and get clear with that person. Without exception, get clear, especially if this is a relationship you want to hold onto. Often, getting clear means you need to apologize. So… what does that mean? An apology, according to dictionary.com is: a written or spoken expression of one’s regret, remorse, or sorrow for having insulted, failed, injured, or wronged another. It does not mean you’re a “sorry person” or somehow less than everyone else when you apologize. It means you are recognizing that you have caused another pain. It means you’ve been human and are being accountable for that. Maybe you don’t know how to apologize or maybe you think you’ve apologized, but the other person is saying you haven’t. Have you missed a step, maybe? Back to the sandwich shop sign…\nThe first step to apologizing is… are you ready? BE ACCOUNTABLE! This means noticing that you’ve hurt another. This means that you’re hearing them when they say, “You hurt me.” This means you recognize that your words and actions caused someone pain. If you did it on accident, didn’t “mean to” hurt them, or were completely unaware that you had done or said something that could hurt, then listen to them when they say they are hurting. And, perhaps they don’t say it out loud, but I’m willing to bet that you can tell when your loved one is bothered by something. Listen to their actions too. Being accountable means you actually say the words and give an accounting of the facts.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:72c1fbf5-2017-4500-bca9-b4ba49eea4e7>"]},{"passage":"If you have ever been offended, chances are you already know how far a simple apology can go toward restoring a strained relationship. Unfortunately, it's not always easy to offer an apology or to admit that we have done something wrong. Some people seem to have a more difficult time than others do when it comes to acknowledging their faults and making amends. Many factors -- including our upbringing, age, gender, personalities, geographic location, religious or spiritual beliefs, and culture -- can influence how skilled and comfortable we are in apologizing for our actions. This guide provides some tips for offering an effective apology. What is An Apology? An apology is a statement that expresses regret over an action or asks pardon for a fault or offense. An effective apology both acknowledges responsibility and expresses remorse. Statements such as \"I am very sorry,\" \"How can I make up for this?\" and \"I won't ever do that again\" are examples of the ways in which we can admit that we are at fault and that we regret our actions. Good apologies can prevent small problems from escalating and are a useful tool in conflict resolution. An effective apology -- one that is thoughtful, genuine and timely – can eases tension, restores trust, and benefits both parties. On the other hand, an insincere apology can make matters worse. Most people can sense when someone is being insincere and they may become even more offended than they initially were. When people feel that they have been wronged and fail to receive the apology they deserve, they often continue to feel hurt and resentment and are more likely to seek revenge or punishment. As you might imagine, it becomes much more difficult to resolve the offense and to move forward. How to Offer An Apology\nAre you involved in a conflict in which you must apologize to someone? Here are some elements you might want to include. - Acknowledge what you did. \"I arrived an hour late for our meeting and did not make my presentation.\" - Take responsibility for your actions and admit that you made a mistake or behaved inappropriately. \"I know that people were counting on me to describe our project. It was my responsibility to let people know that I was running late. I know that I was wrong.\" - Acknowledge the impact that your actions may have had on other people. This might include bruised feelings, inconvenience, stress, or other costs. \"My absence created a great deal of confusion among the other team members, made us appear to be disorganized, and meant that everyone had to work later.\" - Apologize for having caused pain or having done damage. \"I am sorry for the inconvenience I caused and for placing the project in jeopardy.\" - Repair the damage and state your future intentions. An effective apology must include corrective action and convey your desire not to repeat this mistake. \"I would like to make up for my absence by sending everyone a written copy of my presentation. In the future, I will notify people that I may be late and will arrange to have someone cover for me in my absence.\" One of the quickest ways to ruin a perfectly good apology is to offer an excuse or try to cast blame somewhere else. When we err, we sometimes find it easier to offer excuses or to try to justify our actions than to say we are sorry. Excuses such as \"I wasn't feeling well,\" and \"the phone was busy,\" allow us to avoid blame. Although we may acknowledge that a mistake occurred, excuses enable us to deny responsibility for the mistake. \"But It's Much More Complicated...\"\nMost of us, at one time or another, have encountered complex situations in which multiple persons share responsibility for having contributed to a problem. We not only need to offer an apology, we expect to receive an apology from another person. At other times, we may believe that we have not done anything wrong and, consequently, are reluctant to apologize. In these complex situations, conversations between the involved persons might help to clarify each person's concerns and feelings.

We all make mistakes and sometimes hurt the people in our lives that we care about. One of the best ways to fix things, is by simply apologizing from our hearts. Of course, poems help us express and understand how we feel. In celebration of that, reading famous short poems can tug at your heart strings. Best I’m Sorry Poems\nI just feel so much guilt,\nThat my words and actions built. I know, what I did was wrong,\nTried to avoid it, and be strong. Following me has been the truth,\nIt was hurting like a tooth. A second more, I could not deny,\nNot apologizing was a lie. I’m so sorry, from deep inside,\nClearly guilty, my hands are tied. It was obviously, all my fault,\nI have opened my inner vault. To be one with each other\nWhat greater thing is there for two human souls\nthan to feel that they are joined together to strengthen\neach other in all labor, to minister to each other in all sorrow,\nto share with each other in all gladness,\nto be one with each other in the\nsilent unspoken memories? ~ George Eliot\nThe following poem by Elizabeth Barrett Browning is a well-known standard that has helped to mend many relationship fences. It’s been around for ages because it’s so perfect for so many ‘apology’ related reasons…\nHow Do I Love Thee? How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height\nMy soul can reach, when feeling out of sight\nFor the ends of Being and ideal Grace. I love thee to the level of everyday’s\nMost quiet need, by sun and candlelight. I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;\nI love thee purely, as they turn from Praise. I love thee with the passion put to use\nIn my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith. I love thee with a love I seemed to lose\nWith my lost saints,–I love thee with the breath,\nSmiles, tears, of all my life!–and, if God choose,\nI shall but love thee better after death. True friendship is a gift\nOh so precious and so rare\nSometimes we take it for granted\nSometimes we do despair\nOur fault is being human\nMistakes are everywhere\nPlease let me not lose the gift\nThat is so precious and so rare. I am sorry to hurt your feelings my love\nI should have kept my promises as I have told you\nBut I don’t know the reason why I did wrong to you\nI felt sad when I show your tears rolling on your cheeks\nI know you are very upset over me\nand don’t want to talk to me either\nIf you feel that I had hurt you by unpleasant words\nthen please forgive me and accept my sorry\nDo not stop talking to me my love\nIf you do so, my heart will burst into thousand pieces\nYou know how much I am in love with you\nand without you my loneliness will take me to hell\nAlways, there is a special place in my heart for you\nwhere my love for you is so passionate and true\nNo one can melt my heart like you do\nnor clutch my soul to give me new life-like you\nMy love, please talk to me again\nand I promise your love in my life\nwill be pleasant until my end. Please give me a chance to explain,\nWhat I did was completely vain. It was clearly way beyond rude,\nCompletely stupid, I must conclude. I used words, I did not mean,\nI need to stop – acting fifteen. My actions and words, simply not right\nI’m sorry for my anger and spite. Please give me a chance to explain,\nThere must be something wrong with my brain. My emotions, I must learn to control,\nAnd never hurt you, this is my goal. There’s one sad truth in life I’ve found\nWhile journeying east and west –\nThe only folks we really wound\nAre those we love the best. We flatter those we scarcely know,\nWe please the fleeting guest,\nAnd deal full many a thoughtless blow\nTo those who love us best.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ac054937-a020-4946-b36d-5dad11ea18fc>"]}]}

The festival takes place on the last Wednesday of every August and people love to get involved. There’s something about getting soaked in Tomato juice that seems to put a great big smile on everyone’s face. Dump trucks are brought to the scene and people get to dive in and start throwing tomatoes. All the action is followed by celebrations of food and drink and dance. Over 150,000 tomatoes are used every year which come from Extremadura, a less expensive tomato.\nAt 11:00am canons sound by exploding tomato-packed rockets at the people to commence the event. Over 30,000 people show up for the tomato throw down. In 2013, city officials introduced an entry fee and limited the number of participants, citing concerns over safety. At 12:00p.m. the canons sound again signaling that the tomato throwing has come to its end.\nTomato Throwing Pointers:\n- Participants must use goggles and gloves.\n- All tomatoes must be crushed before bring thrown to avoid risk of injury.\n- No other projectiles are allowed to be thrown.\nThe whole idea of a Tomato throwing festival wasn’t an idea at all but an angry play that took place back in August of 1945, when a group of young people went into the town square to attend the Giants and Big-Heads figures parade. The young group decided to cheer with a musician but through the excitement, caused one person to fall off of a float. This created a storm from the fallen participant getting up from the ground and hitting everyone in his path, causing an apparent uproar in the crowd.\nA nearby vegetable stand stood where there were tomatoes and people automatically began pelting one another with them. This was the start of what has become known as La Tomatina.

The festival began unexpectedly in 1945. On the last Wednesday of August, a group of young men decided to throw tomatoes at each other as a prank during a local festival. This act of mischief quickly turned into an annual tradition.\n\nThe origins of the festival are somewhat unclear, with various theories about what sparked the first tomato fight. One popular story involves a group of friends who were inspired by a tomato-throwing scene in a Hollywood movie and decided to recreate it in Buñol. Another theory suggests that the tomato fight was a spontaneous reaction to a political rally gone awry.\n\nWhatever the true cause, the event caught on, and the first official La Tomatina festival took place in 1946. Over the years, it has grown into a massive event, attracting thousands of participants from around the world. Despite its chaotic nature, La Tomatina is celebrated with a spirit of fun and camaraderie, and it has become a beloved tradition in Spain.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context:\nHISTORYThere are plenty of theories on how the legend of La Tomatina came about. The beauty of it all is no one really knows! The old man selling cups of local brew on the street corner will tell you it all began when Don Juan, a Spanish villain and notorious womanizer, was pelted with tomatoes in response to his dreadful singing voice and appalling guitar ability. The little kids trying to make some extra pocket money by looking after your backpack for the night, will swear it was started by a group local rascals raiding a fruit-stand in the town centre and hurling them at each other in a fleeting, moment of madness. And the local women eagerly selling their souvenir T-shirts will say that over 50 years ago a parade, honouring the town’s patron saint Luis Bertràn, ended in carnage when a local produce cart was crushed spilling thousands of ripe tomatoes onto the streets. In true Spanish-fiesta spirit they were promptly picked up and launched at anyone in sight. Whatever legend of La Tomatina you may hear, or choose to believe, nothing comes close to those few breathtaking hours when over 20,000 people ram the streets armed with 250,000 pounds of glorious tomatoes. Forget the term food fight, this is an all-in war! THE FESTIVALOnce a year the sleepy mountain village of Buñol comes alive with thousands of people and truckloads of tomatoes for one of the most amazing spectacles you will ever see! The morning action gets underway when a ham is placed on top of a tall, greased pole in front of the local town hall. The Tomato chaos can only get underway once someone is able to climb the slippery pole and grab the ham. It's hilarious as heaps of people try to scale this pole, climbing over each other, in order to be the illustrious one to claim the ham. Once the ham is snatched the chanting rises to a fever pitch as the trucks roll in and dump masses upon masses of ripe & ready tomatoes in the centre of town, Plaza del Pueblo, and the surrounding streets. The signal for the beginning of the throwing is the firing of five bulbous (tomato-packed rockets) out of a canon and into the air. The crowd erupts into a deafening roar and this launches everyone into a flinging and slinging frenzy. Lock and load because it's on! Forget that Sangria headache from the night before, you are now in the world's largest food fight! This is a salsa riot, this is insane!

Be that as it may, there's just a single lifetime! How might you pick which to join in? We should begin with the essentials. Classes cover, particularly since music, performing expressions and moving (just as eating and drinking) assume a significant job in many occasions, however it's conceivable to partition then into 7 gatherings: Music, Theater, Social, Film, Book, Sports and Nourishment. Presently, we should investigate a couple of them. Numerous unusual celebrations fall under 'culture'. For instance: Kanamara Matsuri in Japan where a penis is the focal topic of the occasion, and the Monkey Smorgasbord in Thailand where Macaques (macaca monkeys) are served more than 2,000 kg of fruity treats, and La Tomatina in Spain where 100 tons of tomatoes are hurled in an immense road fight at the world's biggest nourishment battle. 스포츠중계 celebrations offer a couple of amazements as well, such as dashing obstinate dromedaries Down Under at Camel Cup, and unlimited pontoon rivalries in a without water regatta on a dry riverbed at Henley-on-Todd in the Australian outback, and messy mud moving in the wake of running in mudflat long distance races at Boryeong Mud Fest along Daecheon Sea shore in South Korea. All the particular, peculiar or foolish festivals around the world could fill books, so right now center around the most well known classification, the one gave to music. Select a melodic classification, a date, and a nation and you'll discover feature groups and DJs in the midst of blasts of light and sound on huge stages in epic fields, in frightful survives from surrendered structures, in fields that were once ranches or fields for dairy animals, in old strongholds, along sea shores or lakes, at the highest point of mountains, or on deserts in no place. The absolute best concerts far and wide (expertly advanced ones highlighting rock, alt-pop, metal and electronic types) that are probably going to proceed for a long time to come, include:\nPrimavera Sound and Sónar in Barcelona Spain (at Fira Gran By means of)\nBenicàssim (Lie) in Spain (along the Costa del Azahar nr.

And in Spain, the festival holds special importance in many parts of Andalucia, but especially Córdoba, which has the most famous celebration. Dates from Dates Apr 27, 2012 to May 1, 2012. HISTORY OF THE FESTIVAL\nThe May Crosses Festival celebrated in Andalucia is probably one of the most interesting festivals, not only today, but in historical terms. As legend has it, St Constantine’s mother, the much-venerated St Helen, is the founder of this festival, which shows special respect for the cross upon which Jesus was crucified. As the story goes, in the fourth century AD, St Helen went to Jerusalem in search of the cross, after her son Constantine dreamed of a cross that would help him win a battle he was losing at the time. He ordered his troops to build him a large cross, which they then carried into battle and conquered their enemy. This inspired a family conversion to Christianity and a search for the real cross, led by St Helen. She found three crosses, and to establish which one was authentic, she carried out tests to see which could perform miracles. Only one of them did, healing the sick and even bringing the dead back to life. St Helen then became a champion for the cross, urging people to continue worshipping even after her death. And so this veneration of the cross is the motive for the May Crosses Festivals that are celebrated in so many countries.

Please address\nyour answers and questions to ‘Curiosities’. Was Beethoven black? . In addition to the sources quoted in NI 228 there is a short piece about this by Steve Moore in the Fortean Times No 59, published in 1991. Anyone wanting a copy can probably get it from SKS, 20 Paul Street, Frome, BAl 1 lDX, UK. Moore quotes a friend of Beethoven who described him as 'short, stocky, with broad shoulders, short neck, thick head, round nose, blackish, brown complexion'. Moore's conclusion is that 'a Negro strain introduced by the Moorish invasion of Spain may have made its way to Limbourg' which is where Beethoven ancestors appear to have originated. So, although it is not likely that Beethoven was 100 per cent black, it is on the cards that he was not 100 per cent white either. Why do nomads in the Sahara wear dark colours when light colours are supposed to be cooler? . I've heard a rumour that dark clothes create thermals which are rather more cooling than still air. What are the origins of the Panama hat? . The Panama hat was originally made in Panama and Ecuador from the leaves of the screw-pine tree about 300 years ago. These hats are well suited to protect the wearer from the sun, and were worn for this reason by Jamaican and other workers building the Panama Canal. What was the Football War all about? . The war was about more than football as suggested in Jane Bertram's reply (NI 227). The underlying cause for the war between El Salvador and Honduras was to do with the iniquities of the 1969Central American Common Market which greatly favoured El Salvador in comparison with Honduras. The large number of Salvadorean refugees in Honduras also contributed to this war which was fought on both sides by soldiers equipped by the US. What is the origin of the terms 'left-wing' and 'right-wing'? I have an idea that it dates back to the French Revolution. Is this so?

Many people believe it was the Greeks, but it was not. In this post, we tell you who started this work called harvest, the harvesting of the fruit of the vine, which has remained almost intact to this day. The development of viticulture\nIt was originated by the Egyptians, who developed this practice for the first time with a certain degree of technique, despite the years that separate us. The process was very similar to what we know today: the bunches of grapes were harvested from the vines and placed in baskets that were transported to a press. This process was carried out by the grape harvesters. Wine, at that time, was considered a divine drink that was enjoyed only by the nobility and royalty. It was common to mix it with honey and other aromas that softened its character. Wine acquired a social and relevant character in Greek and Roman society under the protection of the god of wine, Dionysus for the Greeks, Bacchus for the Romans. In honor of this god, innumerable festivities were celebrated, such as the famous bacchanals. The grape harvest in Spain\nThe arrival of Christianity in the Middle Ages had a great influence on the world of wine. The crops were located around the monasteries and their production was destined for the liturgy and food. In the case of the Cistercian monks, the daily consumption of a glass of wine was part of their diet, and the common people included it in their usual diet. From its origins to the present, the technological advances that occurred at the beginning of the 19th century have been transcendental for the evolution of the grape harvest. We must take the history of La Rioja to contextualize the period of expansion in Spain, with the arrival of Basque and later Jerez capital to invest in new wineries in what was then the only prestigious wine area in the country. This capital, in many cases financial, was invested in winemaking with the introduction of stainless steel and other technologies, in a Spain that was beginning to enjoy wine as a consumer product beyond as part of the diet that winegrowers and other agricultural workers needed for daily work. For years, the harvesters were the ones who picked the grapes and selected in the winery which ones were suitable for producing the wine. The ‘industrialization’ of the sector, first in the 19th century with the arrival of French capital in La Rioja to guarantee the supply of grapes after phylloxera devastated the Bordeaux vineyards, and then in the 20th century with the investment of financial and industrial capital, they raised the wineries to the consideration of companies. Harvesting began to share space with technology when the traditional goblet vineyards gave way to trellis plantations in search of better yields. In this sense, the trellis meant that the plant was trained in a more open way to achieve greater exposure to the sun and better aeration, thus reducing the risk of fungal diseases. In this way, a higher population density and a better use of space was achieved, as well as more uniform clusters both in size and ripening. This system also facilitated certain mechanical works, including harvesting by machine. The grape harvest at Familia Martínez Bujanda\nFounded in 1889, the first Familia Martínez Bujanda winery has become a unique space, a museum, an authentic place of wine worship. Located in the upper part of the town of Oyón, it allows visitors to appreciate the winemaking and ageing techniques that were used more than 100 years ago in La Rioja. The winery is distributed on three different levels, to take advantage of gravity in the winemaking process. How was the wine made? The grapes were received by means of “comportones”, which were deposited in open lakes. The grapes were then lightly crushed, and the wines left to ferment for 8-10 days. Once fermented, the wine was separated from the paste to make four fractions of different qualities, which could then be blended or not. The first fraction was the ‘tear wine’, the one that came out by gravity. The second was the standing wine, which came out by stepping on the pasta. The third, the “remango”, which consisted of treading half a lake on top of the other. The fourth, finally, came from the press. The fusion of tradition and technology.\n\nWhat happened july 14 bastille day\nWhat Actually Happened on the Original Bastille Day\nJul 13, · T he French national holiday of Bastille Day— celebrated each year on July 14, or le quatorze juillet —may spell fireworks and and a large military parade for Author: Emma Ockerman.

The storming of the Bastille is an event of the French Revolution which took place on 14 July The surrender of the Bastille, a symbol of despotism, was the effect of an earthquake, in France as in Europe, to the distant imperial Russia. “Strength of secret place and without justice, the Bastille was the first event of the Revolution.”. Mar 14, · Bastille Day, in France and its overseas departements and territories, holiday marking the anniversary of the fall on July 14, , of the Bastille, in Paris. Originally built as a medieval fortress, the Bastille eventually came to be used as a state prison. Political prisoners were often held there, as were citizens detained by the authorities for trial. In the morning of the 14 of July, 30, to 50, bourgeois, workmen and shopkeepers march on the Invalides, the veterans hospital, which also comprised a weapons depot. The military governor of the Invalides does not oppose any resistance, and the regiments of Swiss Guards encamped nearby refuse to intervene. The medieval armory , fortress , and political prison known as the Bastille represented royal authority in the centre of Paris. The prison contained only seven inmates at the time of its storming, but was seen by the revolutionaries as a symbol of the monarchy's abuse of power; its fall was the flashpoint of the French Revolution. This crisis was caused in part by the cost of intervening in the American Revolution and exacerbated by a regressive system of taxation. On 17 June , the third estate , with its representatives drawn from the commoners, reconstituted themselves as the National Assembly , a body whose purpose was the creation of a French constitution.\n\nBy all means, use your text book as your primary source of information.

The beauty of it all is no one really knows! The old man selling cups of local brew on the street corner will tell you it all began when Don Juan, a Spanish villain and notorious womanizer, was pelted with tomatoes in response to his dreadful singing voice and appalling guitar ability. The little kids trying to make some extra pocket money by looking after your backpack for the night, will swear it was started by a group local rascals raiding a fruit-stand in the town centre and hurling them at each other in a fleeting, moment of madness. And the local women eagerly selling their souvenir T-shirts will say that over 50 years ago a parade, honouring the town’s patron saint Luis Bertràn, ended in carnage when a local produce cart was crushed spilling thousands of ripe tomatoes onto the streets. In true Spanish-fiesta spirit they were promptly picked up and launched at anyone in sight. Whatever legend of La Tomatina you may hear, or choose to believe, nothing comes close to those few breathtaking hours when over 20,000 people ram the streets armed with 250,000 pounds of glorious tomatoes. Forget the term food fight, this is an all-in war! THE FESTIVALOnce a year the sleepy mountain village of Buñol comes alive with thousands of people and truckloads of tomatoes for one of the most amazing spectacles you will ever see! The morning action gets underway when a ham is placed on top of a tall, greased pole in front of the local town hall. The Tomato chaos can only get underway once someone is able to climb the slippery pole and grab the ham. It's hilarious as heaps of people try to scale this pole, climbing over each other, in order to be the illustrious one to claim the ham. Once the ham is snatched the chanting rises to a fever pitch as the trucks roll in and dump masses upon masses of ripe & ready tomatoes in the centre of town, Plaza del Pueblo, and the surrounding streets. The signal for the beginning of the throwing is the firing of five bulbous (tomato-packed rockets) out of a canon and into the air. The crowd erupts into a deafening roar and this launches everyone into a flinging and slinging frenzy. Lock and load because it's on! Forget that Sangria headache from the night before, you are now in the world's largest food fight! This is a salsa riot, this is insane!

For instance: Kanamara Matsuri in Japan where a penis is the focal topic of the occasion, and the Monkey Smorgasbord in Thailand where Macaques (macaca monkeys) are served more than 2,000 kg of fruity treats, and La Tomatina in Spain where 100 tons of tomatoes are hurled in an immense road fight at the world's biggest nourishment battle. 스포츠중계 celebrations offer a couple of amazements as well, such as dashing obstinate dromedaries Down Under at Camel Cup, and unlimited pontoon rivalries in a without water regatta on a dry riverbed at Henley-on-Todd in the Australian outback, and messy mud moving in the wake of running in mudflat long distance races at Boryeong Mud Fest along Daecheon Sea shore in South Korea.

And in Spain, the festival holds special importance in many parts of Andalucia, but especially Córdoba, which has the most famous celebration. Dates from Dates Apr 27, 2012 to May 1, 2012. HISTORY OF THE FESTIVAL\nThe May Crosses Festival celebrated in Andalucia is probably one of the most interesting festivals, not only today, but in historical terms. As legend has it, St Constantine’s mother, the much-venerated St Helen, is the founder of this festival, which shows special respect for the cross upon which Jesus was crucified. As the story goes, in the fourth century AD, St Helen went to Jerusalem in search of the cross, after her son Constantine dreamed of a cross that would help him win a battle he was losing at the time. He ordered his troops to build him a large cross, which they then carried into battle and conquered their enemy. This inspired a family conversion to Christianity and a search for the real cross, led by St Helen. She found three crosses, and to establish which one was authentic, she carried out tests to see which could perform miracles. Only one of them did, healing the sick and even bringing the dead back to life. St Helen then became a champion for the cross, urging people to continue worshipping even after her death. And so this veneration of the cross is the motive for the May Crosses Festivals that are celebrated in so many countries.

In addition to the sources quoted in NI 228 there is a short piece about this by Steve Moore in the Fortean Times No 59, published in 1991. Anyone wanting a copy can probably get it from SKS, 20 Paul Street, Frome, BAl 1 lDX, UK. Moore quotes a friend of Beethoven who described him as 'short, stocky, with broad shoulders, short neck, thick head, round nose, blackish, brown complexion'. Moore's conclusion is that 'a Negro strain introduced by the Moorish invasion of Spain may have made its way to Limbourg' which is where Beethoven ancestors appear to have originated. So, although it is not likely that Beethoven was 100 per cent black, it is on the cards that he was not 100 per cent white either.

The war was about more than football as suggested in Jane Bertram's reply (NI 227). The underlying cause for the war between El Salvador and Honduras was to do with the iniquities of the 1969Central American Common Market which greatly favoured El Salvador in comparison with Honduras. The large number of Salvadorean refugees in Honduras also contributed to this war which was fought on both sides by soldiers equipped by the US.

Many people believe it was the Greeks, but it was not. In this post, we tell you who started this work called harvest, the harvesting of the fruit of the vine, which has remained almost intact to this day. The development of viticulture\nIt was originated by the Egyptians, who developed this practice for the first time with a certain degree of technique, despite the years that separate us. The process was very similar to what we know today: the bunches of grapes were harvested from the vines and placed in baskets that were transported to a press. This process was carried out by the grape harvesters. Wine, at that time, was considered a divine drink that was enjoyed only by the nobility and royalty. It was common to mix it with honey and other aromas that softened its character. Wine acquired a social and relevant character in Greek and Roman society under the protection of the god of wine, Dionysus for the Greeks, Bacchus for the Romans. In honor of this god, innumerable festivities were celebrated, such as the famous bacchanals. The grape harvest in Spain\nThe arrival of Christianity in the Middle Ages had a great influence on the world of wine. The crops were located around the monasteries and their production was destined for the liturgy and food. In the case of the Cistercian monks, the daily consumption of a glass of wine was part of their diet, and the common people included it in their usual diet. From its origins to the present, the technological advances that occurred at the beginning of the 19th century have been transcendental for the evolution of the grape harvest. We must take the history of La Rioja to contextualize the period of expansion in Spain, with the arrival of Basque and later Jerez capital to invest in new wineries in what was then the only prestigious wine area in the country. This capital, in many cases financial, was invested in winemaking with the introduction of stainless steel and other technologies, in a Spain that was beginning to enjoy wine as a consumer product beyond as part of the diet that winegrowers and other agricultural workers needed for daily work. For years, the harvesters were the ones who picked the grapes and selected in the winery which ones were suitable for producing the wine. The ‘industrialization’ of the sector, first in the 19th century with the arrival of French capital in La Rioja to guarantee the supply of grapes after phylloxera devastated the Bordeaux vineyards, and then in the 20th century with the investment of financial and industrial capital, they raised the wineries to the consideration of companies. Harvesting began to share space with technology when the traditional goblet vineyards gave way to trellis plantations in search of better yields. In this sense, the trellis meant that the plant was trained in a more open way to achieve greater exposure to the sun and better aeration, thus reducing the risk of fungal diseases. In this way, a higher population density and a better use of space was achieved, as well as more uniform clusters both in size and ripening. This system also facilitated certain mechanical works, including harvesting by machine. The grape harvest at Familia Martínez Bujanda\nFounded in 1889, the first Familia Martínez Bujanda winery has become a unique space, a museum, an authentic place of wine worship. Located in the upper part of the town of Oyón, it allows visitors to appreciate the winemaking and ageing techniques that were used more than 100 years ago in La Rioja. The winery is distributed on three different levels, to take advantage of gravity in the winemaking process. How was the wine made? The grapes were received by means of “comportones”, which were deposited in open lakes. The grapes were then lightly crushed, and the wines left to ferment for 8-10 days. Once fermented, the wine was separated from the paste to make four fractions of different qualities, which could then be blended or not. The first fraction was the ‘tear wine’, the one that came out by gravity. The second was the standing wine, which came out by stepping on the pasta. The third, the “remango”, which consisted of treading half a lake on top of the other. The fourth, finally, came from the press. The fusion of tradition and technology.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:3be9c52c-ca96-471a-8709-1b71a315830b>"]},{"passage":"What happened july 14 bastille day\nWhat Actually Happened on the Original Bastille Day\nJul 13, · T he French national holiday of Bastille Day— celebrated each year on July 14, or le quatorze juillet —may spell fireworks and and a large military parade for Author: Emma Ockerman.

The storming of the Bastille is an event of the French Revolution which took place on 14 July The surrender of the Bastille, a symbol of despotism, was the effect of an earthquake, in France as in Europe, to the distant imperial Russia. “Strength of secret place and without justice, the Bastille was the first event of the Revolution.”. Mar 14, · Bastille Day, in France and its overseas departements and territories, holiday marking the anniversary of the fall on July 14, , of the Bastille, in Paris. Originally built as a medieval fortress, the Bastille eventually came to be used as a state prison. Political prisoners were often held there, as were citizens detained by the authorities for trial. In the morning of the 14 of July, 30, to 50, bourgeois, workmen and shopkeepers march on the Invalides, the veterans hospital, which also comprised a weapons depot. The military governor of the Invalides does not oppose any resistance, and the regiments of Swiss Guards encamped nearby refuse to intervene. The medieval armory , fortress , and political prison known as the Bastille represented royal authority in the centre of Paris. The prison contained only seven inmates at the time of its storming, but was seen by the revolutionaries as a symbol of the monarchy's abuse of power; its fall was the flashpoint of the French Revolution. This crisis was caused in part by the cost of intervening in the American Revolution and exacerbated by a regressive system of taxation. On 17 June , the third estate , with its representatives drawn from the commoners, reconstituted themselves as the National Assembly , a body whose purpose was the creation of a French constitution.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:5e32aae3-042b-446d-b7f6-43dc8d146ecb>"]},{"passage":"By all means, use your text book as your primary source of information.

Bricker and Bell suggest that practices develop not only over time, but also across multiple settings and opportunities. Their study shows how, over several years, one youth’s identification with science was shaped by many everyday moments, social configurations, and collaborators. Maltese, A., Melki, C., & Weibke, H.

Both groups said that they became interested in STEM early, usually by Grade 6. Those who persisted in STEM were more likely than those who did not to say that they had always been interested in STEM.

Bateson 1999 Journal of Environmental Education v. 31 n. 1, p. 27-32\nThis statistical study from the Journal of Environmental Education identifies the relationship between students' attitude toward science and their attitude toward the environment. Canadian 9th grade students answered attitude question sets about the environment and about science in general. The strongest correlation identified was that students who had a positive attitude toward science also had a positive attitude toward the environment. Another correlation indicated that while students favored preservation of natural resources, they did not favor a reduction in freedom for logging companies, farmers, automobile drivers, and so on.\n\nIndependent of each other, they explored many different options, changing wing shapes and size, adding and removing weights at different locations, etc... with an excitement on their face each time a flight trial led to another possible prospect or idea for improvement and off they went, eager to make a change in their design. Middle school students I have had in another STEM class, building electronic circuits, do a similar type of exploration when after learning about and using certain common circuit parts, they alter a simple design to do more or different things, in a different way, at a different time or in a different order - all to meet a particular \"purpose\" they had imagined in their mind. Scientists use the scientific method to make testable explanations and predictions about the world. An engineer identifies a specific need and then, he or she creates a solution that meets the need. In real life, the distinction between science and engineering is not always clear, but in my recent STEM focused Super Saturdays classes, learning about the differences has meant a lot of hands-on, minds-on, engaging exploration!\n\nThemes in Science and Technology Education 1(1), 7-36\nMatthews, Philip.

As we talked about last month, the Internet is chock-full of sites claiming that their activities will turn your young people into scientists and engineers. We know however that all STEM activities are not created equal and it can be challenging to find the right fit for your club or program. Execution, or how you facilitate the STEM activities, is also really important. We will talk about that in future posts! Look for activities that focus on real world things that your young people will be interested in and will spark their curiosity. It is also helpful if the activity has multiple creative solutions and not just one right answer. Here on campus we run a program called Teen Science Café where high school students work with one of our Rutgers scientists or engineers to learn about current research on a STEM topic of their interest. The teens invited an engineer, Dr. Benaroya, to explore the idea of moving to another planet?

This refers to analysis of a sample (in this context, a protein) by more than one independent method of analysis. For example, a classical 2-D gel provides two independent, orthogonal parameters, pI and apparent size. MALDI of the intact protein from the gel provides a third dimension, mass, which is an intrinsic property of the protein and is similar, but more useful, than the relative size derived from the SDS dimension. MALDI of the CNBr fragments of the protein directly from the gel provides a true fourth dimension of analysis. analysis of the relationships between three or more variables (as opposed to bivariate analysis, which involves two variables, or univariate analysis which involves one). A statistical analysis technique in which multiple variables are analyzed separately to determine the contribution made by each variable to an observed result. Contrast with univariate analysis. a statistical term refering to analyses that involve a number of different variables. For example, an analysis that looked at whether peer factors and individual factors both influence alcohol use would be called \"multivariate\". A range of techniques that permit the analysis of several variables simultaneously. Most often refers to statistical tests that examine more than two variables at the same time. a generic term for any statistical technique used to analyze data from more than one variable\nAny of several methods for examining multiple variables at the same time. Usage varies. (a) Stricter usage reserves the term for designs with two or more independent variables and two or more dependent variables. (b) More loosely, multivariate analysis applies to designs with more than one independent variable or more than one dependent variable or both. Whichever usage you prefer, either allows researchers to examine the relation between two variables while simultaneously controlling for the influence of other variables. Examples include path analysis, factor analysis, multiple regression analysis, MANOVA, LISREL, canonical correlations, and discriminant analysis. A set of statistical techniques for analyzing the individual and joint effects of a number of factors on the outcomes of the process or disease being studied. Multivariate analysis is a statistical technique that entails the analysis of the relationships between more than two variables. Carrying out multivariate analysis in this research means we could isolate the effect of design on business performance from other factors. See the Detailed research methodology for more information.

The analysis of more than two variables simultaneously, for the purpose of determining the relationship among them. a statistical analysis that involves more than one dependent variable. analysis involving multiple independent or dependent variables. The analysis of relationships between several variables â€“ e.g. factor analysis. is performed when datasets are composed of vector observations. These can consist of observations of different variables at one location or gridpoint values for a particular time sequence.

Let’s understand the possible combinations in detail:\nContinuous & Continuous: While doing bi-variate analysis between two continuous variables, we should look at scatter plot. It is a nifty way to find out the relationship between two variables. The pattern of scatter plot indicates the relationship between variables. The relationship can be linear or non-linear. Scatter plot shows the relationship between two variable but does not indicates the strength of relationship amongst them. To find the strength of the relationship, we use Correlation. Correlation varies between -1 and +1. - -1: perfect negative linear correlation\n- +1:perfect positive linear correlation and\n- 0: No correlation\nCorrelation can be derived using following formula:\nCorrelation = Covariance(X,Y) \/ SQRT( Var(X)* Var(Y))\nVarious tools have function or functionality to identify correlation between variables. In Excel, function CORREL() is used to return the correlation between two variables and SAS uses procedure PROC CORR to identify the correlation. These function returns Pearson Correlation value to identify the relationship between two variables:\nIn above example, we have good positive relationship(0.65) between two variables X and Y.\nCategorical & Categorical: To find the relationship between two categorical variables, we can use following methods:\n- Two-way table: We can start analyzing the relationship by creating a two-way table of count and count%. The rows represents the category of one variable and the columns represent the categories of the other variable. We show count or count% of observations available in each combination of row and column categories. - Stacked Column Chart: This method is more of a visual form of Two-way table. - Chi-Square Test: This test is used to derive the statistical significance of relationship between the variables. Also, it tests whether the evidence in the sample is strong enough to generalize that the relationship for a larger population as well. Chi-square is based on the difference between the expected and observed frequencies in one or more categories in the two-way table. It returns probability for the computed chi-square distribution with the degree of freedom. Probability of 0: It indicates that both categorical variable are dependent\nProbability of 1: It shows that both variables are independent. Probability less than 0.05: It indicates that the relationship between the variables is significant at 95% confidence. The chi-square test statistic for a test of independence of two categorical variables is found by:\nwhere O represents the observed frequency. E is the expected frequency under the null hypothesis and computed by:\nFrom previous two-way table, the expected count for product category 1 to be of small size is 0.22. It is derived by taking the row total for Size (9) times the column total for Product category (2) then dividing by the sample size (81). This is procedure is conducted for each cell. Statistical Measures used to analyze the power of relationship are:\n- Cramer’s V for Nominal Categorical Variable\n- Mantel-Haenszed Chi-Square for ordinal categorical variable. Different data science language and tools have specific methods to perform chi-square test. In SAS, we can use Chisq as an option with Proc freq to perform this test. Categorical & Continuous: While exploring relation between categorical and continuous variables, we can draw box plots for each level of categorical variables. If levels are small in number, it will not show the statistical significance. To look at the statistical significance we can perform Z-test, T-test or ANOVA. - Z-Test\/ T-Test:- Either test assess whether mean of two groups are statistically different from each other or not.If the probability of Z is small then the difference of two averages is more significant. The T-test is very similar to Z-test but it is used when number of observation for both categories is less than 30. - ANOVA:- It assesses whether the average of more than two groups is statistically different. Example: Suppose, we want to test the effect of five different exercises. For this, we recruit 20 men and assign one type of exercise to 4 men (5 groups). Their weights are recorded after a few weeks. We need to find out whether the effect of these exercises on them is significantly different or not.\n\nIndependent and dependent variable examples in a study to determine whether how long a student sleeps affects test scores, the independent variable is length of time spent sleeping while the dependent variable is the test score. The independent variable, also known as the manipulated variable, is the factor manipulated by the researcher, and it produces one or more results, known as dependent variables home research. The dependent variable is what is affected by the independent variable-- your effects or outcomes for example, if you are studying the effects of a new educational program on student achievement, the program is the independent variable and your measures of achievement are the dependent ones. Why is the independent variable labeled the independent variable because it is independent of research participants' actions – participants have no control over what condition or group they are assigned to. After you have described the research problem and its significance in relation to prior research, explain why you have chosen to examine the problem using a method of analysis that investigates the relationships between or among independent and dependent variables state what it is about the research problem that lends itself to this type of . An independent variable is a variable believed to affect the dependent variable this is the variable that you, the researcher, will manipulate to see if it makes the dependent variable change. Sociologists classify social phenomena being studied as independent and dependent variables understanding social research requires knowledge of the difference . A basis for which sociologists determine whether their independent and dependent variables reflect the results b a sociological research approach that seeks in-depth understanding of a topic or subject through observation or interaction this approach is not based on hypothesis testing. The outcome variable measured in each subject, which may be influenced by manipulation of the independent variable is termed the dependent variable in the example of quadriceps strengthening, the strengthening protocol used is the independent variable, and the maximal torque generated isometrically on an isokinetic dynamometer by the .

Interesting results emerged when we analyzed data from our Camp Invention Research Project: Institute for Learning Innovation study regarding what STEM areas girls and boys enjoy learning about. Using a five-point rating scale with five being the highest, we asked 485 fourth and fifth-grade Camp Invention participants how much they liked finding out about or learning about various STEM topics. These topics were selected to measure interest in three main STEM areas: Life Science, Earth Science, and Technology and Engineering. Utilizing T-Tests, we found that the 209 girls liked finding out about Life Science more than the 276 boys (average rating of 3.69 to 3.37) and that the boys liked finding out about Technology and Engineering more than the girls (average rating of 4.18 to 3.98). While this finding may not be overly surprising to some people, what we found particularly interesting is that no statistically significant difference was found between the reported liking of finding out about Earth Science between the girls and the boys (average rating of 4.15 and 4.00). We also asked the participants to rate their agreement to the question, “My friends think science and engineering are cool.”\nUtilizing regression models, we found there to be a statistically significant and positive relationship between a participant’s friends thinking science and engineering are cool and their own enjoyment in finding out about all three of the STEM areas! Interestingly, while no difference in the average rating for liking learning about Earth Science was found between the girls and the boys, the relationship between girls’ friends thinking science and engineering is cool and their rating of liking finding out about Earth Science was stronger than for the boys. Indeed, for the girls, we found that for every one-unit increase in the rating of their friends’ thinking science and engineering is cool we could predict a corresponding increase of .21 units in their own rating of liking finding out about Earth Science (the predicted increase for the boys was .19 units). While the statistical tests we utilized don’t prove causation, their statistically significant and predictive quality provides us evidence that there definitely is a positive relationship between friends’ attitudes towards science and engineering and a child’s own enjoyment in finding out about Life Science, Earth Science, and Technology and Engineering. Parents, have you found this to be displayed in your own children’s friendships? For more information on these findings, feel free to contact Data Scientist, David Meier.

MALDI of the intact protein from the gel provides a third dimension, mass, which is an intrinsic property of the protein and is similar, but more useful, than the relative size derived from the SDS dimension. MALDI of the CNBr fragments of the protein directly from the gel provides a true fourth dimension of analysis. analysis of the relationships between three or more variables (as opposed to bivariate analysis, which involves two variables, or univariate analysis which involves one). A statistical analysis technique in which multiple variables are analyzed separately to determine the contribution made by each variable to an observed result. Contrast with univariate analysis. a statistical term refering to analyses that involve a number of different variables. For example, an analysis that looked at whether peer factors and individual factors both influence alcohol use would be called \"multivariate\". A range of techniques that permit the analysis of several variables simultaneously. Most often refers to statistical tests that examine more than two variables at the same time. a generic term for any statistical technique used to analyze data from more than one variable\nAny of several methods for examining multiple variables at the same time. Usage varies. (a) Stricter usage reserves the term for designs with two or more independent variables and two or more dependent variables. (b) More loosely, multivariate analysis applies to designs with more than one independent variable or more than one dependent variable or both. Whichever usage you prefer, either allows researchers to examine the relation between two variables while simultaneously controlling for the influence of other variables. Examples include path analysis, factor analysis, multiple regression analysis, MANOVA, LISREL, canonical correlations, and discriminant analysis. A set of statistical techniques for analyzing the individual and joint effects of a number of factors on the outcomes of the process or disease being studied. Multivariate analysis is a statistical technique that entails the analysis of the relationships between more than two variables.

Let’s understand the possible combinations in detail:\nContinuous & Continuous: While doing bi-variate analysis between two continuous variables, we should look at scatter plot. It is a nifty way to find out the relationship between two variables. The pattern of scatter plot indicates the relationship between variables. The relationship can be linear or non-linear. Scatter plot shows the relationship between two variable but does not indicates the strength of relationship amongst them. To find the strength of the relationship, we use Correlation. Correlation varies between -1 and +1. - -1: perfect negative linear correlation\n- +1:perfect positive linear correlation and\n- 0: No correlation\nCorrelation can be derived using following formula:\nCorrelation = Covariance(X,Y) \/ SQRT( Var(X)* Var(Y))\nVarious tools have function or functionality to identify correlation between variables. In Excel, function CORREL() is used to return the correlation between two variables and SAS uses procedure PROC CORR to identify the correlation. These function returns Pearson Correlation value to identify the relationship between two variables:\nIn above example, we have good positive relationship(0.65) between two variables X and Y.\nCategorical & Categorical: To find the relationship between two categorical variables, we can use following methods:\n- Two-way table: We can start analyzing the relationship by creating a two-way table of count and count%. The rows represents the category of one variable and the columns represent the categories of the other variable. We show count or count% of observations available in each combination of row and column categories. - Stacked Column Chart: This method is more of a visual form of Two-way table. - Chi-Square Test: This test is used to derive the statistical significance of relationship between the variables. Also, it tests whether the evidence in the sample is strong enough to generalize that the relationship for a larger population as well. Chi-square is based on the difference between the expected and observed frequencies in one or more categories in the two-way table. It returns probability for the computed chi-square distribution with the degree of freedom. Probability of 0: It indicates that both categorical variable are dependent\nProbability of 1: It shows that both variables are independent. Probability less than 0.05: It indicates that the relationship between the variables is significant at 95% confidence. The chi-square test statistic for a test of independence of two categorical variables is found by:\nwhere O represents the observed frequency. E is the expected frequency under the null hypothesis and computed by:\nFrom previous two-way table, the expected count for product category 1 to be of small size is 0.22. It is derived by taking the row total for Size (9) times the column total for Product category (2) then dividing by the sample size (81). This is procedure is conducted for each cell. Statistical Measures used to analyze the power of relationship are:\n- Cramer’s V for Nominal Categorical Variable\n- Mantel-Haenszed Chi-Square for ordinal categorical variable. Different data science language and tools have specific methods to perform chi-square test. In SAS, we can use Chisq as an option with Proc freq to perform this test. Categorical & Continuous: While exploring relation between categorical and continuous variables, we can draw box plots for each level of categorical variables. If levels are small in number, it will not show the statistical significance. To look at the statistical significance we can perform Z-test, T-test or ANOVA. - Z-Test\/ T-Test:- Either test assess whether mean of two groups are statistically different from each other or not.If the probability of Z is small then the difference of two averages is more significant. The T-test is very similar to Z-test but it is used when number of observation for both categories is less than 30. - ANOVA:- It assesses whether the average of more than two groups is statistically different. Example: Suppose, we want to test the effect of five different exercises. For this, we recruit 20 men and assign one type of exercise to 4 men (5 groups). Their weights are recorded after a few weeks. We need to find out whether the effect of these exercises on them is significantly different or not.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:f9216a37-f874-4aad-920b-19877fcc9a41>"]},{"passage":"Independent and dependent variable examples in a study to determine whether how long a student sleeps affects test scores, the independent variable is length of time spent sleeping while the dependent variable is the test score.

Applying ideas from theoretical computer science, such as analysis of algorithms and computational complexity, enables us to place optical computing in a framework where we can try to answer a number of important questions. For example,which problems are optical computers suitable for solving? Also, how does the resource usage on optical computers compare with more standard (e.g. digital electronic) architectures? The physical principles behind some efficiencies in optical computing are outlined here. 1. Fan-in efficiency\nKirchoff’s Law is well understood in analog electronics as a natural and constant time means of summing the current at the intersection of an arbitrary number of wires. In optics, the same thing is possible by directing several light beams towards a point detector with a linear response to incident light. Such an optical arrangement sums n non-negative integers in O(1) addition steps. On a model of a sequential digital electronic computer this would require n − 1 addition operations and even many typical (bounded fan-in)parallel models, with n or more processors, take O(log n) time steps. Tasks that rely on scalar summation operations (such as matrix multiplication) would benefit greatly from an optical implementation of the scalar sum operation. Similarly, O(1) multiplication and O(1) convolution operations can be realised optically. Very recently, an optics-based digital signal processing platform has been marketed that claims digital processing speeds of tera (10^12) operations per second. 2. Efficiency in interconnection complexity\nAs optical pathways can cross in free space without measurable effect on the information in either channel, high interconnection densities are possible with optics. Architectures with highly parallel many-to-many interconnections between parallel surfaces have already been proposed for common tasks such as sorting. Currently, intrachip, inter-chip, and inter-board connections are being investigated for manufacturing feasibility. 3. Energy efficiency\nElectrical wires suffer from induced noise and heat, which increases dramatically whenever wires are made thinner or placed closer together, or whenever the data throughput is increased. As a direct consequence of their resistance free pathways and noise-reduced environments, optical systems have the potential to generate less waste heat and so consume less energy per computation step than electronic systems. This has beend emonstrated experimentally with general purpose digital optical processors.\n\nResearchers at the Technische Universität Darmstadt in Germany have managed to stop light for up to one minute inside a crystal and store digitally-encoded information inside it. The technique shatters previous records and could prove very useful in developing faster and highly-efficient quantum and optical computers. The switch to photonics\nToday's technologies use semiconductor-based processors and storage devices to compute and store data electronically. However, with data being increasingly transmitted in the optical regime (e.g. through fiber optics), switching to all-optical components is appearing more and more like an appealing prospect. Photons are much harder to interact with and manipulate than electrons, but if this hurdle can be cleared, switching from electronics to a photonics ecosystem would bring about many key advantages. Electronic components dissipate a large portion of energy as heat, whereas in photonics components losses are very limited. Optical storage and computation would also be resistant to radiation, have a much higher transmission bandwidth, and allow for the manipulation of a single photon at a time, which would translate into better performance at a tiny fraction of the energy cost. \"Although classical data storage already offers very high read\/write rates, optical data storage has the potential to be much faster,\" Georg Heinze, who was part of the research team, told Gizmag. \"If everything operates in the optical regime there is no need to convert optical pulses in electronic signals and vice versa.\" Bringing light to a halt\nTo store data in a photonics device, the researchers use a technique known as electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). EIT consists of firing a laser \"control beam\" at a crystal which contains ions of the element praseodymium. The laser triggers a quantum reaction in the crystal that has two contemporary effects. First, it makes this normally opaque crystal transparent over a narrow spectrum; and secondly, it changes the refractive index of the crystal dramatically, slowing the incoming light pulse down to a complete halt. At this point, the researchers fire a second laser beam (containing the information to be stored) at the crystal. At the precise moment in which the laser beam carrying the information is crossing the temporarily transparent crystal, the control beam is turned off, trapping light and information inside the now opaque crystal. The photons are converted into atomic spin excitations (or \"spin waves\"), which can be stored in the crystal until the control beam is fired again and the spin waves are turned back into light, which finally escapes the crystal. Scientists have used this technique in previous experiments, but they could only use it to store data for a few millionths of a second. This is because the spin wave is very delicate, subject to energy fluctuations that can corrupt the information it encodes. The TU Darmstadt team figured out how they could prolong this storage time significantly. Their approach was to develop an algorithm that senses the noise and applies magnetic fields and high-frequency pulses to the crystal to maintain the spin wave in its original state, so that the information is kept safe for as long as possible – up to a minute. \"In this first proof-of-principle experiment we focused on long storage times rather than on transfer rates,\" says Heinze. \"However, we showed that by image storage it is possible to increase the storage capacity of the memory, and this is very important feature for spatially multiplexed quantum memories.\" The researchers are now building on this result to try and store light for even longer periods of time (up to a week) in a more energy-efficient way while achieving higher data transfer rates. In a word of caution, however, Heinze points out that it will probably be several years before this technology is ready for commercial use, and possibly decades before all-photonics devices become the norm in consumer devices. The team's research appears on the journal Physical Review Letters.\n\nScientists from the University of Oxford have developed a tiny nanoscale device that can be programmed using either photons or electrons. This electro-optical device is a bridge between traditional electronic computing and the emerging field of optical computing, and it could lead to faster and more energy-efficient processors and memory in the future. “Computing at the speed of light has been an enticing but elusive prospect, but with this development, it’s now in tangible proximity,” Phys.org reports. Scientists have been trying to use light to transfer information extremely fast since the 1950s. However, there are practical limitations of how light can be used in this manner, especially when trying to integrate it along with electronic computing hardware. The problem is that electrical chips operate most efficiently when they are small in size, but optical chips benefit from being larger. This is because the wavelength of light is larger than that of electrons. The new device uses light which has been compressed into a small size, in a process called surface plasmon polariton. This allows optical chips to be integrated along with electrical chips because now the sizes are more comparable. The ability for devices to work in both electrical and optical domains, without the need for conversion, allows the creation of dual functionalities that can use both photons and electrons for processing. “This is a very promising path forward in computation and especially in fields where high processing efficiency is needed,” Nikolaos Farmakidis, graduate student and co-first author, said in a statement. There are many potential uses of this technology, but the current focus is on applications that require a large amount of processing power, such as artificial intelligence. The new device can improve on current technology like complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication of MOSFETs, which are the transistors that form the basis of many modern digital circuits. Co-author Nathan Youngblood explains the potential applications for the new nanoscale device: “This naturally includes artificial intelligence applications where on many occasions, the needs for high-performance, low-power computing far exceeds our current capabilities. It is believed that interfacing light-based photonic computing with its electrical counterpart is the key to the next chapter in CMOS technologies.”\nThe findings are published in the journal Science Advances.\n\nMobile communication for voice applications (e.g., cellular phone) is widely established throughout the world and witnesses a very rapid growth in all its dimensions including the increase in the number of subscribers of various cellular networks. An extension of this technology is the ability to send and receive data across various cellular networks using small devices such as smartphones. There can be numerous applications based on this technology; for example, video call or conferencing is one of the important applications that people prefer to use in place of existing voice (only) communications on mobile phones. Mobile computing–based applications are becoming very important and rapidly evolving with various technological advancements as it allows users to transmit data from remote locations to other remote or fixed locations. 1.9 Quantum Computing\nManufacturers of computing systems say that there is a limit for cram-ming more and more transistors into smaller and smaller spaces of inte-grated circuits (ICs) and thereby doubling the processing power about every 18 months. This problem will have to be overcome by a new quantum\ncomputing–based solution, wherein the dependence is on quantum\n7 Computing Paradigms\n1.10 Optical Computing\nOptical computing system uses the photons in visible light or infrared beams, rather than electric current, to perform digital computations. An elec-tric current flows at only about 10% of the speed of light. This limits the rate at which data can be exchanged over long distances and is one of the factors that led to the evolution of optical fiber. By applying some of the advantages of visible and\/or IR networks at the device and component scale, a computer can be developed that can perform operations 10 or more times faster than a conventional electronic computer. Nanocomputing refers to computing systems that are constructed from nanoscale components. The silicon transistors in traditional computers may be replaced by transistors based on carbon nanotubes. The successful realization of nanocomputers relates to the scale and inte-gration of these nanotubes or components. The issues of scale relate to the dimensions of the components; they are, at most, a few nanometers in at least two dimensions. The issues of integration of the components are twofold: first, the manufacture of complex arbitrary patterns may be economically infeasible, and second, nanocomputers may include massive quantities of devices. Researchers are working on all these issues to bring nanocomputing a reality. 1.12 Network Computing\nAlmost all the computing paradigms that were discussed earlier are of this nature. Even in the future, if any one invents a totally new computing para-digm, it would be based on a networked architecture, without which it is impossible to realize the benefits for any end user. We are into a post-PC era, in which a greater number and a variety of com-puters and computing paradigms with different sizes and functions might be used everywhere and with every human being; so, the purpose of this chap-ter is to illustrate briefly the ideas of all these computing domains, as most of these are ubiquitous and pervasive in its access and working environment. • Mobile computing: Mobile computing consists of small processing elements (i.e., handheld devices) and the communication between various resources is by using wireless media (see Section 1.8). • Nanocomputing: Makes use of nanoscale components (see Section 1.11). 1.

Computer data storage provides one of the core functions of the modern computer, that of information retention. It is one of the fundamental components of all modern computers, and coupled with a central processing unit (CPU, a processor), implements the basic computer model used since the 1940s. In contemporary usage, memory usually refers to a form of semiconductor storage known as random-access memory (RAM) and sometimes other forms of fast but temporary storage. Similarly, storage today more commonly refers to mass storage — optical discs, forms of magnetic storage like hard disk drives, and other types slower than RAM, but of a more permanent nature. Historically, memory and storage were respectively called main memory and secondary storage. The terms internal memory and external memory are also used. The contemporary distinctions are helpful, because they are also fundamental to the architecture of computers in general. The distinctions also reflect an important and significant technical difference between memory and mass storage devices, which has been blurred by the historical usage of the term storage. Nevertheless, this article uses the traditional nomenclature.\n\nThe growing demands of high definition digital video content, fixed content data, and compliance and security application will soon outstrip the capabilities of current storage technologies to keep up the demand. Clearly a new storage paradigm is needed to meet the growing storage demands. So what is it going to be?With its omnipresent computer, all connected via the internet, the information age has led to an explosion of information available to users. The decreasing cost of storing data and the increasing storage capability of the same small device footprint have been key enablers of this revolution. While current storage needs are being met, storage technology must continue to improve in order to keep pace with the rapidly increasing demand. So how is it going to be?Both magnetic and conventional optical data storage technologies, where individual bits are stored as distinct magnetic or optical changes on the surface of a recording medium are approaching physical limits beyond which individual bits may be too small or too difficult to store. So what next step is going to be?Storing information throughout the volume of a medium, not just on its surface is an intriguing solution to our entire problem regarding storage. So this is it, Holographic Data Storage. Holographic Data Storage is a volumetric approach which, although conceived decades ago, has made recent progress towards practicality with the appearance of lower-cost enabling technologies, significant results from longstanding research efforts and progress in holographic recording materials.This is a quest to find the answer to these entire questions, the technology and the story behind the next revolution in data storage. Advantages of HVD\n1. Resistance to damage - If some parts of the medium are damaged, all information can still be obtained from other parts. 2. Efficient retrieval - All information can be retrieved from any part of the medium. 3. These discs have the capacity to hold up to 3.9 terabyte (TB) of information, which is approximately 6,000 times the capacity of a CDROM, 830 times the capacity of a DVD, 160 times the capacity of single-layer Blu-ray-Discs, and about 48 times the capacity of standard computer hard drives. 4. The HVD also has a transfer rate of 1 gigabit\/s. 5. While reading a page the entire page of data can be retrieved quickly and at one time .\n\nMemory and storage are two terms that are regularly used to mean the same thing in computer technology. The reason for this is that some devices designed as memory also act as storage devices. There is however a distinction between the two terms. This article discusses the differences. Storage is where programs and other data can be stored permanently. It can also refer to temporary storage which is offered by devices normally meant for memory. Storage holds data and programs in such a way that it can be accessed by the processor through the computer memory. Storage includes hard disk drives and removable devices such as optical disks and memory cards. |Includes cache, primary and secondary memory||Includes storage devices such as optical disks, hard disks and memory cards|\n|Easy retrieval of data||Slower access than memory|\n|Computer will not run without it||Computer can be used even without it|\n|Upgradeable but expensive||Upgradeable and affordable|\n|Uses semiconductor chips||Uses magnetic disk technology, optical technology and semiconductor technology|\nMemory vs Storage\nSo what is the difference between memory and storage? Let’s find this out based on types, data access speeds, computer system dependence, cost and technology used. - Memory can refer to any device that stores data and instructions either temporarily or permanently for execution. It includes cache, primary and secondary memory. Storage on the other hand includes storage devices which store data and programs in a semi-permanent or permanent state. The stored data and programs can be accessed by the memory for processing. - Memory is quite fast. The access of data and instructions by the processor needs to be extremely fast to enable efficiency of the computer system. Access to data and programs in storage is relatively slow. This can be seen when you try to watch a DVD video using a computer. The computer will take a few seconds before it identifies the storage media (DVD), reads its contents and runs the appropriate program to enable video watching. - The computer system needs installed memory to run. The memory is the location where all data and instructions needed to execute a program are stored. The storage on the other hand is optional. - Memory can be upgraded by installing higher capacity chips. They are relatively expensive given that they use high speed technology. Upgrading storage is cheaper since storage devices use slower technology. - Memory mainly uses semiconductor chip technology. It’s quite fast but expensive. Storage on the other hand mainly uses magnetic and optical technology. However, emerging trends in storage are making used of solid state drives and semiconductor technology.\n\n29 August 2007—Scientists say one way to build a really fast computer is to use light rather than electricity to perform calculations. Now researchers from Mikhail Lukin’s group at Harvard and the Danish National Research Foundation Center for Quantum Optics and the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen have taken a big step toward this goal with the first feasible plan for making a transistor that uses photons of light instead of electricity. Details were recently published online by the journal Nature Physics . Unlike other schemes, this new optical transistor could be controlled with just one photon, making it very efficient. And it would work for a broad range of frequencies of light, instead of just one (as with some previous proposals), making it easy to use. A single photon transistor is ”the holy grail of optical computation, both classical and quantum,” says John Howell, a professor of quantum optics at the University of Rochester, who was not involved in the research. If the Harvard researchers can put their theory into practice and build a photon transistor—and they’ve already started initial experiments, IEEE Spectrum has learned—the result would pave the way to an all-optical computer that could potentially do much faster calculations than even some supercomputers. The digital computers we are familiar with today calculate by channeling electrons through a network of transistors. But even the fastest computer processors available are limited by the speed of their electrons, which travel at a fraction of the speed of light. Substitute photons for electrons and computing could happen at light speed. That’s the idea, anyway. The reality is, to this point, no one has been able to make such an optical computer’s most basic component—a transistor driven by photons. An electronic transistor is basically a semiconductor device that amplifies a voltage signal. There are three electrodes in a transistor—one of which is used to control the current flowing between the other two. A photon transistor would work in a similar fashion. Two beams of light would enter the device. One, which could be as weak as a single photon, carries the signal to be amplified. The other would carry the light to be modulated by the signal. An amplified light signal would then exit the device. Amplifying a light signal is inherently much more difficult than amplifying an electrical one. Unlike electrons, which have negative charge and interact easily with matter and each other, photons in a beam of light are electrically neutral and do not interact much with matter. A photon is also typically not affected by another beam coming into its path. A promising way to get light to interact with matter and itself is to create what physicists call a surface plasmon. Surface plasmons form at the junction between a nonconducting material, or dielectric, and a metal. Metals have lots of free electrons, which oscillate when light shines on them. But when a dielectric borders a metal, the movement of the electrons is curtailed, because electrons cannot enter the dielectric. That forces the jiggling electrons to move in waves of density—like sound—along the junction. In theory, surface plasmons offer a way to create a transistor by using one beam of light falling on the metal to modulate another beam through electromagnetic interaction. But in practice it has proved to be quite difficult, because surface plasmons do not interact well with optical fibers, which are typically used to feed light to the metal and dielectric junction. Most other sources of light fare no better. Last year, a group at Queen’s University in Belfast, Northern Ireland, led by Anatoly Zayats came close, with a surface plasmon device made up of a gold disk pocked with 360 holes and coated with a polymer. There have been a number of other demonstrations as well, but to this point amplification works only over a very narrow range of wavelengths of light. It would be better to have an approach where a large range of different wavelengths would be able to make the same device work, because then the lasers involved would not have be to as sensitively tuned to each other. Lukin’s group at Harvard realized that a possible solution lay in using conducting metal nanowires.\n\nELECTRONIC IMAGING & STORAGE GUIDE\nScanners are becoming smaller, cheaper, faster and more functional\nhe first step in most imaging applications is to capture text, graphics and photos so that they can be stored for easy reference. Electronic scanners do this by using light to \"read\" images off paper documents, microfilm or photographic film. Ordinary scanners take pictures of images for archival applications in which images are stored for reference only. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) devices are used to recognize shapes and characters from predefined fields and convert them into digital computer code, so that text can be manipulated once it is scanned. Until recently, many government imaging projects involved high-end color scanners capable of processing more than 100 pages a minute and costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. These large flatbed units, from companies such as Sharp and Xerox, are used in sophisticated defense and intelligence applications, or to tackle high-volume paperwork such as tax forms or medical records. But now agencies are turning to scanners for smaller jobs as well. Inexpensive desktop and handheld models are being used to store correspondence and other simple tasks. Sheet-fed units, from companies such as Hewlett-Packard and Microtek, can be as small as a PC mouse and cost as little as $200. Data capture has become so popular that Compaq and Hewlett-Packard recently introduced computers with scanners built into the keyboards. Increased competition in the scanners market has resulted in less expensive and more sophisticated machines. Time- and money-saving features once considered optional are now standard on many models. Duplex scanning, which enables images on both sides of documents to be captured at the same time, is rapidly replacing simplex scanning. Other features such as automatic feeders, color dropout options and super-high resolutions also are turning up on medium-range and low-end machines. Higher resolutions, however, require more scanning time per page and more storage capacity. Scanning speeds on lower-resolution units are up to about 150 pages a minute, with an average recognition accuracy of 95 percent. Some models have built-in spell checkers and word-analysis programs to ease the cleanup job when characters are misread. Many OCR devices use \"fuzzy logic\" to decipher mispelled words.","passages":[{"passage":"European light research opens door for optical storage and computing\nThe goal of replacing electronics with optics for processing data in computers is coming closer through cutting edge European research into the mysterious properties of “fast and slow” light. The long term aim is to boost processing speeds and data storage densities by several orders of magnitude and take the information technology industry into a new era, combining greatly improved performance with dramatically lower energy consumption. The phenomenon of “fast and slow” light arises from the dispersion of electromagnetic waves when they interact with, and travel through, a physical medium such as a crystal. This can have the effect of slowing down the light pulses, or on occasions appearing to cause local acceleration. These speed variations have the potential for developing purely optical devices using just electromagnetic radiation, rather than electrical signals, to store and process information. In the more immediate future, these properties will be used to enhance existing hybrid communication systems combining electronic and photonic (light-based) devices. But first more fundamental research is needed, and the current state of play along with a roadmap for future projects was discussed at a recent workshop organised by the European Science Foundation (ESF). The project achieved its main objectives of reviewing the state of the art, highlighting possible applications, and gathering a dispersed European community of scientists, according to the workshop’s convenor Marco Santagiustina. “There were two remarkable highlights: slow and fast light research has immense potential in applications like microwave and millimeter wave photonics, and secondly such applications can be targeted by making progress in a selected set of technologies,” said Santagiustina. Light signals are already used for communication over fibre optic cables, but cannot yet be stored directly, or used for computation. This would require slowing down the light signals so that they can be buffered within a small area, and can be achieved by exploiting “fast and slow” light effects. Before the arrival of true photonic computing, there is the more immediate prospect of building optical interconnects for example in communication networks, which would reduce latency, the time taken for signals to travel from source to destination. Latency imposed by the communications network has become a significant problem in an age of globalisation where computers in different continents are cooperating in tasks that need to be executed very quickly in fractions of a second. Another more immediate application of “fast and slow” light is likely to come from the ability in processing ultrawide band microwave signals, for radio communications, both for mobile telephony and wireless LANs. “Fast and slow” light can be harnessed to transmit radio frequencies directly over fibre, making it easier, cheaper, and more efficient to connect up base stations or wireless access points. “Radio over fiber is an existing application field destined to grow in the near future,” said Santagiustina. “This field will also represent a significant step forward for the photonic\/electronic convergence. In that area the time-delay\/phase-shift provided by slow and fast light devices can yield unprecedented functions.”\nSome of these functions have not yet been conceived, but the fundamental point is that converging photonics with electronics reduces delays and increases the bandwidth available, cutting costs and boosting communications capacity.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ce1a9862-3acc-47fe-a46f-5d9cba25c524>"]},{"passage":"Optical computing is an inherently multidisciplinary subject whose study routinely involves a spectrum of expertise that threads optical physics, materials science, optical engineering, electrical engineering, computer architecture, computer programming, and computer theory. Applying ideas from theoretical computer science, such as analysis of algorithms and computational complexity, enables us to place optical computing in a framework where we can try to answer a number of important questions. For example,which problems are optical computers suitable for solving? Also, how does the resource usage on optical computers compare with more standard (e.g. digital electronic) architectures? The physical principles behind some efficiencies in optical computing are outlined here. 1. Fan-in efficiency\nKirchoff’s Law is well understood in analog electronics as a natural and constant time means of summing the current at the intersection of an arbitrary number of wires. In optics, the same thing is possible by directing several light beams towards a point detector with a linear response to incident light. Such an optical arrangement sums n non-negative integers in O(1) addition steps. On a model of a sequential digital electronic computer this would require n − 1 addition operations and even many typical (bounded fan-in)parallel models, with n or more processors, take O(log n) time steps. Tasks that rely on scalar summation operations (such as matrix multiplication) would benefit greatly from an optical implementation of the scalar sum operation. Similarly, O(1) multiplication and O(1) convolution operations can be realised optically. Very recently, an optics-based digital signal processing platform has been marketed that claims digital processing speeds of tera (10^12) operations per second. 2. Efficiency in interconnection complexity\nAs optical pathways can cross in free space without measurable effect on the information in either channel, high interconnection densities are possible with optics. Architectures with highly parallel many-to-many interconnections between parallel surfaces have already been proposed for common tasks such as sorting. Currently, intrachip, inter-chip, and inter-board connections are being investigated for manufacturing feasibility. 3. Energy efficiency\nElectrical wires suffer from induced noise and heat, which increases dramatically whenever wires are made thinner or placed closer together, or whenever the data throughput is increased. As a direct consequence of their resistance free pathways and noise-reduced environments, optical systems have the potential to generate less waste heat and so consume less energy per computation step than electronic systems. This has beend emonstrated experimentally with general purpose digital optical processors.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ac456a32-9360-4961-be4b-8baafe289cc6>"]},{"passage":"Researchers at the Technische Universität Darmstadt in Germany have managed to stop light for up to one minute inside a crystal and store digitally-encoded information inside it. The technique shatters previous records and could prove very useful in developing faster and highly-efficient quantum and optical computers. The switch to photonics\nToday's technologies use semiconductor-based processors and storage devices to compute and store data electronically. However, with data being increasingly transmitted in the optical regime (e.g. through fiber optics), switching to all-optical components is appearing more and more like an appealing prospect. Photons are much harder to interact with and manipulate than electrons, but if this hurdle can be cleared, switching from electronics to a photonics ecosystem would bring about many key advantages. Electronic components dissipate a large portion of energy as heat, whereas in photonics components losses are very limited. Optical storage and computation would also be resistant to radiation, have a much higher transmission bandwidth, and allow for the manipulation of a single photon at a time, which would translate into better performance at a tiny fraction of the energy cost. \"Although classical data storage already offers very high read\/write rates, optical data storage has the potential to be much faster,\" Georg Heinze, who was part of the research team, told Gizmag. \"If everything operates in the optical regime there is no need to convert optical pulses in electronic signals and vice versa.\" Bringing light to a halt\nTo store data in a photonics device, the researchers use a technique known as electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). EIT consists of firing a laser \"control beam\" at a crystal which contains ions of the element praseodymium. The laser triggers a quantum reaction in the crystal that has two contemporary effects. First, it makes this normally opaque crystal transparent over a narrow spectrum; and secondly, it changes the refractive index of the crystal dramatically, slowing the incoming light pulse down to a complete halt. At this point, the researchers fire a second laser beam (containing the information to be stored) at the crystal. At the precise moment in which the laser beam carrying the information is crossing the temporarily transparent crystal, the control beam is turned off, trapping light and information inside the now opaque crystal. The photons are converted into atomic spin excitations (or \"spin waves\"), which can be stored in the crystal until the control beam is fired again and the spin waves are turned back into light, which finally escapes the crystal. Scientists have used this technique in previous experiments, but they could only use it to store data for a few millionths of a second. This is because the spin wave is very delicate, subject to energy fluctuations that can corrupt the information it encodes. The TU Darmstadt team figured out how they could prolong this storage time significantly. Their approach was to develop an algorithm that senses the noise and applies magnetic fields and high-frequency pulses to the crystal to maintain the spin wave in its original state, so that the information is kept safe for as long as possible – up to a minute. \"In this first proof-of-principle experiment we focused on long storage times rather than on transfer rates,\" says Heinze. \"However, we showed that by image storage it is possible to increase the storage capacity of the memory, and this is very important feature for spatially multiplexed quantum memories.\" The researchers are now building on this result to try and store light for even longer periods of time (up to a week) in a more energy-efficient way while achieving higher data transfer rates. In a word of caution, however, Heinze points out that it will probably be several years before this technology is ready for commercial use, and possibly decades before all-photonics devices become the norm in consumer devices. The team's research appears on the journal Physical Review Letters.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:5e638db3-5eac-4f0a-9664-97b9b098e391>"]},{"passage":"Scientists from the University of Oxford have developed a tiny nanoscale device that can be programmed using either photons or electrons. This electro-optical device is a bridge between traditional electronic computing and the emerging field of optical computing, and it could lead to faster and more energy-efficient processors and memory in the future. “Computing at the speed of light has been an enticing but elusive prospect, but with this development, it’s now in tangible proximity,” Phys.org reports. Scientists have been trying to use light to transfer information extremely fast since the 1950s. However, there are practical limitations of how light can be used in this manner, especially when trying to integrate it along with electronic computing hardware. The problem is that electrical chips operate most efficiently when they are small in size, but optical chips benefit from being larger. This is because the wavelength of light is larger than that of electrons. The new device uses light which has been compressed into a small size, in a process called surface plasmon polariton. This allows optical chips to be integrated along with electrical chips because now the sizes are more comparable. The ability for devices to work in both electrical and optical domains, without the need for conversion, allows the creation of dual functionalities that can use both photons and electrons for processing. “This is a very promising path forward in computation and especially in fields where high processing efficiency is needed,” Nikolaos Farmakidis, graduate student and co-first author, said in a statement. There are many potential uses of this technology, but the current focus is on applications that require a large amount of processing power, such as artificial intelligence. The new device can improve on current technology like complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication of MOSFETs, which are the transistors that form the basis of many modern digital circuits. Co-author Nathan Youngblood explains the potential applications for the new nanoscale device: “This naturally includes artificial intelligence applications where on many occasions, the needs for high-performance, low-power computing far exceeds our current capabilities.

There can be numerous applications based on this technology; for example, video call or conferencing is one of the important applications that people prefer to use in place of existing voice (only) communications on mobile phones. Mobile computing–based applications are becoming very important and rapidly evolving with various technological advancements as it allows users to transmit data from remote locations to other remote or fixed locations. 1.9 Quantum Computing\nManufacturers of computing systems say that there is a limit for cram-ming more and more transistors into smaller and smaller spaces of inte-grated circuits (ICs) and thereby doubling the processing power about every 18 months.

An elec-tric current flows at only about 10% of the speed of light. This limits the rate at which data can be exchanged over long distances and is one of the factors that led to the evolution of optical fiber. By applying some of the advantages of visible and\/or IR networks at the device and component scale, a computer can be developed that can perform operations 10 or more times faster than a conventional electronic computer. Nanocomputing refers to computing systems that are constructed from nanoscale components. The silicon transistors in traditional computers may be replaced by transistors based on carbon nanotubes. The successful realization of nanocomputers relates to the scale and inte-gration of these nanotubes or components. The issues of scale relate to the dimensions of the components; they are, at most, a few nanometers in at least two dimensions. The issues of integration of the components are twofold: first, the manufacture of complex arbitrary patterns may be economically infeasible, and second, nanocomputers may include massive quantities of devices. Researchers are working on all these issues to bring nanocomputing a reality. 1.12 Network Computing\nAlmost all the computing paradigms that were discussed earlier are of this nature.

And it would work for a broad range of frequencies of light, instead of just one (as with some previous proposals), making it easy to use. A single photon transistor is ”the holy grail of optical computation, both classical and quantum,” says John Howell, a professor of quantum optics at the University of Rochester, who was not involved in the research. If the Harvard researchers can put their theory into practice and build a photon transistor—and they’ve already started initial experiments, IEEE Spectrum has learned—the result would pave the way to an all-optical computer that could potentially do much faster calculations than even some supercomputers. The digital computers we are familiar with today calculate by channeling electrons through a network of transistors. But even the fastest computer processors available are limited by the speed of their electrons, which travel at a fraction of the speed of light. Substitute photons for electrons and computing could happen at light speed. That’s the idea, anyway. The reality is, to this point, no one has been able to make such an optical computer’s most basic component—a transistor driven by photons. An electronic transistor is basically a semiconductor device that amplifies a voltage signal. There are three electrodes in a transistor—one of which is used to control the current flowing between the other two. A photon transistor would work in a similar fashion. Two beams of light would enter the device. One, which could be as weak as a single photon, carries the signal to be amplified. The other would carry the light to be modulated by the signal. An amplified light signal would then exit the device. Amplifying a light signal is inherently much more difficult than amplifying an electrical one. Unlike electrons, which have negative charge and interact easily with matter and each other, photons in a beam of light are electrically neutral and do not interact much with matter. A photon is also typically not affected by another beam coming into its path. A promising way to get light to interact with matter and itself is to create what physicists call a surface plasmon. Surface plasmons form at the junction between a nonconducting material, or dielectric, and a metal. Metals have lots of free electrons, which oscillate when light shines on them. But when a dielectric borders a metal, the movement of the electrons is curtailed, because electrons cannot enter the dielectric. That forces the jiggling electrons to move in waves of density—like sound—along the junction. In theory, surface plasmons offer a way to create a transistor by using one beam of light falling on the metal to modulate another beam through electromagnetic interaction. But in practice it has proved to be quite difficult, because surface plasmons do not interact well with optical fibers, which are typically used to feed light to the metal and dielectric junction. Most other sources of light fare no better. Last year, a group at Queen’s University in Belfast, Northern Ireland, led by Anatoly Zayats came close, with a surface plasmon device made up of a gold disk pocked with 360 holes and coated with a polymer. There have been a number of other demonstrations as well, but to this point amplification works only over a very narrow range of wavelengths of light. It would be better to have an approach where a large range of different wavelengths would be able to make the same device work, because then the lasers involved would not have be to as sensitively tuned to each other. Lukin’s group at Harvard realized that a possible solution lay in using conducting metal nanowires.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:db902255-8d7b-41eb-a9fb-c3241b1f7ea1>"]},{"passage":"ELECTRONIC IMAGING & STORAGE GUIDE\nScanners are becoming smaller, cheaper, faster and more functional\nhe first step in most imaging applications is to capture text, graphics and photos so that they can be stored for easy reference. Electronic scanners do this by using light to \"read\" images off paper documents, microfilm or photographic film. Ordinary scanners take pictures of images for archival applications in which images are stored for reference only. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) devices are used to recognize shapes and characters from predefined fields and convert them into digital computer code, so that text can be manipulated once it is scanned. Until recently, many government imaging projects involved high-end color scanners capable of processing more than 100 pages a minute and costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. These large flatbed units, from companies such as Sharp and Xerox, are used in sophisticated defense and intelligence applications, or to tackle high-volume paperwork such as tax forms or medical records. But now agencies are turning to scanners for smaller jobs as well. Inexpensive desktop and handheld models are being used to store correspondence and other simple tasks. Sheet-fed units, from companies such as Hewlett-Packard and Microtek, can be as small as a PC mouse and cost as little as $200. Data capture has become so popular that Compaq and Hewlett-Packard recently introduced computers with scanners built into the keyboards. Increased competition in the scanners market has resulted in less expensive and more sophisticated machines. Time- and money-saving features once considered optional are now standard on many models. Duplex scanning, which enables images on both sides of documents to be captured at the same time, is rapidly replacing simplex scanning. Other features such as automatic feeders, color dropout options and super-high resolutions also are turning up on medium-range and low-end machines. Higher resolutions, however, require more scanning time per page and more storage capacity. Scanning speeds on lower-resolution units are up to about 150 pages a minute, with an average recognition accuracy of 95 percent. Some models have built-in spell checkers and word-analysis programs to ease the cleanup job when characters are misread. Many OCR devices use \"fuzzy logic\" to decipher mispelled words.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ad29568d-e486-4ff5-b955-c8240bf1365a>"]}]}

That seems increasingly elusive in our overnetworked society, where every buzz and rumor is instantly blogged and tweeted, and it is not contemplation we desire but an odd sort of distraction, distraction masquerading as being in the know. In such a landscape, knowledge can’t help but fall prey to illusion, albeit an illusion that is deeply seductive, with its promise that speed can lead us to more illumination, that it is more important to react than to think deeply, that something must be attached to every bit of time.

Photograph: Amoris-Causa\nView original post\nMontaigne portrait – Dali 1947\nMeditation is a rich and powerful method of study for anyone who knows how to examine his mind, and to employ it vigorously. I would rather shape my soul than furnish it. There is no exercise that is either feeble or more strenuous, according to the nature of the mind concerned, than that of conversing with one’s own thoughts. The greatest men make it their vocation, “those for whom to live is to think. – Montaigne\n“Meditation,” here, is taken to mean “cerebration,” vigorous thinking — the same practice John Dewey addressed so eloquently a few centuries later in How We Think. This conflation, at first glance, seems rather antithetical to today’s notion of meditation — a practice often mistakenly interpreted by non-practitioners as non-thinking, an emptying of one’s mind, a cultivation of cognitive passivity. In reality, however, meditation requires an active, mindful presence, a bearing witness to one’s inner experience as it unfolds. In that regard, despite the semantic evolution of the word itself, Montaigne’s actual practice of meditation was very much aligned with the modern concept and thus centuries ahead of his time, as were a great deal of his views.\nThe great majority of men and women, in ordinary times, pass through life without ever contemplating or criticising, as a whole, either their own conditions or those of the world at large. They find themselves born into a certain place in society, and they accept what each day brings forth, without any effort of thought beyond what the immediate present requires…they seek the satisfaction of the needs of the moment, without much forethought, and without considering that by sufficient effort the whole condition of their lives could be changed…It is only a few rare and exceptional men who have that kind of love toward mankind at large that makes them unable to endure patiently the general mass of evil and suffering, regardless of any relation it may have to their own lives. These few, driven by sympathetic pain, will seek, first in thought and then in action, for some way…\nView original post 32 more words\n…it will be well to consider…what is the value of philosophy and why it ought to be studied. It is the more necessary to consider this question, in view of the fact that many men, under the influence of science or of practical affairs, are inclined to doubt whether philosophy is anything better than innocent but useless trifling, hair-splitting distinctions, and controversies on matters concerning which knowledge is impossible.\nThe value of philosophy is, in fact, to be sought largely in its very uncertainty. The man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense, from the habitual beliefs of his age or his nation, and from convictions which have grown up in his mind without the co-operation or consent of his deliberate reason. To such a man the world tends to become definite, finite, obvious; common objects rouse no questions, and unfamiliar possibilities are contemptuously rejected. As soon as we begin to philosophize, on the contrary, we find, as we saw in our opening chapters, that even the most everyday things lead to problems to which only very incomplete answers can be given. Philosophy, though unable to tell us with certainty what is the true answer to the doubts which it raises, is able to suggest many possibilities which enlarge our thoughts and free them from the tyranny of custom. Thus, while diminishing our feeling of certainty as to what things are, it greatly increases our knowledge as to what they may be; it removes the somewhat arrogant dogmatism of those who have never travelled into the region of liberating doubt, and it keeps alive our sense of wonder by showing familiar things in an unfamiliar aspect.\n“I’ve always tried to make a home for myself, but I have not felt at home in myself.

While it may not provide definite answers, philosophy helps free us from the prejudices of common sense and habitual beliefs. It suggests many possibilities that expand our thoughts, reduces dogmatic certainty, and helps us see familiar things in unfamiliar ways. This keeps alive our sense of wonder and increases our knowledge of what things may be, even if we become less certain about what things are.","answer":"Philosophy is valuable even though it doesn't provide definite answers because it encourages critical thinking, self-reflection, and a deeper understanding of the world and our place within it. It helps us question assumptions, challenge established beliefs, and explore various perspectives on fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, ethics, and reality. Through this process, philosophy fosters intellectual growth, promotes ethical reasoning, and enhances our ability to make informed decisions. It also cultivates empathy and understanding by encouraging us to consider the viewpoints of others, thereby enriching our interpersonal relationships and societal interactions. Ultimately, philosophy contributes to personal development, intellectual curiosity, and a more nuanced appreciation of life's complexities.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context:\nI believe there are few things more valuable than building a meaningful philosophy on life. Although this may sound like a question best reserved for theologians and great thinkers, at the heart it is a practical question: What is your strategy for living? Your criteria may differ, but I believe all good life philosophies have four basic parameters:\n- Survival. Except in rare circumstances, most good philosophies will fulfill your basic needs. This usually isn’t a big concern since most of us are living well beyond the minimum threshold required to simply survive. - Happiness. Good life philosophies should make you feel good. Great philosophies will keep you happy even in troubling circumstances. Victor Frankl in his book, Man’s Search for Meaning, demonstrated how even in incredible suffering of the concentration camps he could still endure because of a powerful strategy for living. - Meaning. Happiness can rarely exist without meaning. Good philosophies should make you feel useful and valuable, otherwise when pleasurable moments fade you are left with nothing. - Independence of Circumstance. Your life philosophy needs to apply in all situations and circumstances. Your strategy for deriving meaning and happiness should last even after a breakup, death of a relative or unemployment. Everyone has a philosophy on life, whether they realize it or not. The process of refining this philosophy is like building a ship. It will carry you in rough times and allow you to float easily during the pleasant moments. Here are some tips for refining your strategy on life:\n- Introspection. A life philosophy cannot be outsourced. Although many major religions package premade philosophies, the work of building a strategy for life is yours alone. Thinking about your beliefs and strategies is the only real way to do that. I recommend journaling or meditation to guide your thinking to come to real solutions. - Study other philosophies. Gather philosophies from other people and books. I try to be as broad as possible when exposing myself to other ways of thinking. I don’t believe you can be corrupted by a new way of thinking, so don’t limit yourself to exploring philosophies that only fit within your current expectations. - Focus on the answerable. Philosophy should be practical. This means focusing less on the unanswerable questions that just lead you in circles. I’m an atheist, but my opinion is that the question of whether there is a man in the clouds is besides the point. There is no grand truth, just now and experience. Answerable questions are like:\n- “What should I do to have a meaningful life?”\n- “How should I view painful moments so they don’t overwhelm me?”\n- “How should I act in relationships with other people?”\n- Don’t commit. Building a philosophy is an ongoing process of refinement, not an end result. I don’t ever expect to find a final answer, just increasingly better ones. My approach is to view any strategies I currently have as being the best available right now, but I am always open to new understandings. - Seek references. Experience can sculpt your strategy on life. I aim to find as many broad experiences as possible so I can use them as points of reference when developing a life philosophy. This doesn’t mean you need to smoke a lot of drugs or live in the wilderness, naked, for a year. Just that you shouldn’t limit yourself to the routine of your daily life. - Connect with others. Discuss your philosophy and find the philosophy of other people. I do my best to reserve judgment and simply observe. I’ve heard completely different philosophies on life from my own and each is a valuable source of new ideas. Don’t stop the flow by preaching or judging those with a different worldview. - Experiment. Philosophies need to be practical. They should affect how you think and what you do. Experiment with different approaches and see which connects best with the four criteria I mentioned above. - Collect new functions. Lenses and metaphors are an important component of a strategy for living. Read this article on building a library of thought functions to find more. - Hold conflicting ideas. I believe it was Aristotle who said, “it is the mark of an educated mind to hold two conflicting ideas in his head without accepting either.”\n- Be patient. I’m far from having a perfect strategy for living. I expect the process of refining a life philosophy will take decades, perhaps my entire life. There are no final answers, just slightly optimized ones.\n\nAnd whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful.

Even though, intellectually, I know that life is to be lived, not to be questioned, emotionally, the question pulls me towards itself again and again. Recently, I’ve been thinking why is that the question keeps nagging and what can I do to settle it for some time. Digging a bit further, I realized that there are two parts to the question:\n- First: why do we keep questioning what is the meaning of life? - Second: why don’t we ever get satisfied with an answer? Why do we keep questioning? One insight comes from evolutionary biology: our ancestors who were curious did better, survived more, and had more descendants than the ones who didn’t question things. Our drive for information foraging is evolutionarily advantageous. The entire bedrock of Science is this unceasing questioning about why something happened. Why don’t we get an answer? Our drive for questioning comes from trying to understand the world around us. We ask why did the rain happen because we want to control it. The answer to a ‘why’ question in the world necessarily includes a cause and an effect. Our thinking ability is shaped by our intuition about physics and that intuition says things have causes and effects. The cause-and-effect structure of our thinking is so fundamental that even babies perceive the world that way. This causal mode of thinking has served us very well in most domains where we’ve applied. However, when we apply it to our\nAn answer to this question is fundamentally unthinkable because our thinking requires a cause-and-effect. As I wrote in the review of the book The Outer Limits of Reason, this strong feeling that everything must have a cause and effect is so ingrained that we have trouble accepting the randomness of quantum mechanics. If we cannot bring ourselves to accept that the position of an electron could be arbitrary, how can we come to accept the felt arbitrariness of life? We feel that there must be a hidden variable explaining this arbitrariness. Another difficulty accepting an answer to the question of life is that it’s trivial to negate the answer by acting or imagining to act opposite to what the answer suggests. If a guru says life’s purpose is in helping others, why does eating ice cream feel so good? To reiterate, I feel the answer to what’s the meaning of life is unthinkable because thinking implies cause-and-effect chains and in first person perspective, there is no necessary cause or effect. We can’t find meaning in our life because we feel like free agents. This confusion, like most philosophical confusions, arise from confused language use. Philosophers call it the category error. (For a further deep-dive on this, see my earlier essay: philosophy is politics.) Either we can give up being free or we can give up questioning life. But giving up either is hard\nYou bet it is. So what is one supposed to do? Do you notice a contradiction when you use the word ‘supposed’ in\nThe only thing I can advice is that be suspicious of anyone who claims to have an answer. You can choose to live however you want to. And if you are not sure how to live your life, keep drifting without guilt.\n\nWhat is wisdom and why is it so valuable? Are you wise? Am I wise? How do any of us really know? While I may or may not be wise, I do work very hard to take what I teach and use it personally. Why? Two reasons. To show how common sense ideas can be applied anywhere and because it actually makes my life better. Period. Simple example, but I encourage you not to be tempted to dismiss it’s significance. I never capitalize my name. That’s a whole other story waiting to be told. Back to the questions and the point. What is wisdom? How about this thought:\n“In the absence of clearly defined goals, we become strangely loyal to performing daily acts of trivia.” — anonymous\nA few weeks ago (here’s the link if you want instant access: www.junglejeff.net\/?p=257 ), I wrote a post that contained the essence of this quote. Do you know how long I lived my life strangely loyal to performing daily acts of trivia? Wwwwaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy too long. Now, not so much. Not perfect by any means. Never will be. But, I am more razor-focused on World-Class delivery and content than ever. Razor-focused. I often wonder what took me so long to figure out the difference in results, when I’m razor-focused, compared to when I was loyal to performing daily acts of trivia. Make it a GREAT, razor-focused day, because if you don’t, who will. Carpe diem, jungle jeff 🙂\nPS. Tomorrow, the story of no caps. Maybe.\n\nWhat is your personal philosophy, and how does it work in your daily life? Note that I'm not asking what you believe, necessarily. I'm asking what you know, and how you apply that knowledge every day, and what effects does the application of that knowledge have. For instance, do you have a core lesson you learned years ago from a significant life experience? How has that lesson shaped the way you live your life, how you interact with other people, and how you get things done? What decisions do you make because of that lesson, and how do the effects of those decisions ripple outward? Can you point to specific ways that you or someone else has benefited from your lessons? How does your decision-making process made the world a better (or worse) place? I know that I don't know all there is to know. I know that I can learn something even from those with whom I disagree. I know I have been loved unconditionally and that that has made the biggest difference in my life. I know there are many things in this world that cannot be seen or sensed with our unassisted senses, so I am open to possibilities that transcend my experience. Therefore, I have made it my philosophy to have a tolerant, open-minded, humble approach toward life and individuals and knowledge. I have made it my philosophy to love everyone as I am able and desire the best life has in store for them as they learn, grow, change and fulfill their potentials. I have made it my philosophy to make a difference for good in the world through random and intentional acts of kindness, love and charity. I realize that choices that I make set in motion far-reaching influences and effects that will touch many people in helpful or unhelpful ways, so I try to be conscientious about the choices I make. I should add that I fail miserably in these ideals all too often, but as an eternal optimist and positive thinker, I take the lessons to heart and go forward with a resolve to do better with the next choice. It's important to point out that I do not view choices simply as a response to the situations foisted upon me by life's circumstances, but that I can take a pro-active approach to making choices at any time as I think of ways to live out the ideals of my philosophy. My greatest success story is the influence my philosophy has had upon my sons. I have helped them become responsible, sensitive, loving young men who have also worked hard to gain knowledge and wisdom. It's sincerely gratifying to me to see what they have become. Again, I've had my failures, but I have talked openly with my sons about them and have helped them to learn from my mistakes as I have learned, also. Beyond my sons, I am certain that my friendly, helpful attitude toward co-workers and others I meet during the day makes a positive difference in at least some cases, which may very well set in motion a ripple effect that touches others in a positive way. answered 10 Nov '09, 07:17\nOne of my personal philosophies in life is not to make too much of a big deal about bad things that happen to me. I will treat everything as an opportunity to learn and make sure that the unwanted thing does not happen to me again but I will not stress over it or get depressed over it. Anything that happens to me, I know I have attracted and I have the power to change it by changing my vibration. It has become easier and easier for me to deal with unexpected and unwanted things that happen in life. I have had health problems in the past which I thought would never be cured but by applying the principles I know about the law of attraction, I found a way to get better and healthy again. But the reason I got the health problems in the first place was because I used to get depressed and worked up about a lot of things in my life. So, I have a less serious approch to life now. I try and find the positive aspects of everything that happens to me everyday. And just have more fun and enjoy the ride. answered 11 Nov '09, 20:32\nIf you are seeing this message then the Inward Quest system has noticed that your web browser is behaving in an unusual way and is now blocking your active participation in this site for security reasons.

Quite frankly, I am would be totally shocked and surprised, that any body beside me would think this way as well. Why do things happen the way they do? Why so some children suffer while others are spoiled with wealth? Why do some children fail school while others pass? Why does someone get all hundreds in math and eighties in English? Answer to the question \"why do things happen the way they do? \", and a question \"Why is it so hard to fix all of these problems we face in, sadly, everyday life\", it is because (I personally believe) that everything happens for a reason. Because everything happens for a reason, although we may not always realize what the reason is. for example, if you have been taking swimming lessons for five months and you still are clueless in how to swim, it may just be because you were simply to destined to learn how to swim, still, there is no harm in trying. I have another question too, \"why do most humans harm other living beings?\" does an insect not hold the same importance as a king? Why? Why do most human beings not think about that chicken's family before they eat it? According to my personal opinion, Life is about learning, and in Life, you are put through many tests, and are told to make many decisions, some turn out to be successful, while others don't. You can say that you did or didn't do this when your life is finished, but you can never say that Life hasn't taught you something or that you haven't learned anything from life, even if you die just thirty minutes after you are born. How? You discover the most innocent moments of your life. Do you realize that these words can save a life? How valuable a life is? Millions of innocents die each day, and yet we are unable to even feel the pain! Even the simplest sentences can have the deepest meaning. We have all the facilities in life, more than any other being, and yet we want to be entertained...why? How does it benefit us? But, have you noticed how many less philosophical people there are? Especially teens? Teens just don't understand the pain of loss, and those teens who do suffer because every body thinks their weird. Because the teens we grow up with don't witness someone dying every day like the children did during the holocaust as their fathers were taken on the street and beaten.

It can help bring assurance when making decisions and can give us the strength to do things that may not seem easy. It also allows us to weed out stress-causing activities and busyness by checking whether they align with our priorities in life. Today: Take a moment to reflect and understand your priorities in life. Write your “why” down and put it in a place where you will be able to see it every day to refocus and remember where you are headed.\n\nHow to Answer the Question “Who Am I?”\nThe question “Who am I?” is one of the most fundamental and thought-provoking inquiries we can make about ourselves. It delves into the essence of our being, exploring our identity, values, and purpose in life. Answering this question is a deeply personal and subjective journey, but here are some steps to guide you on your path of self-discovery. 1. Self-reflection: To answer the question “Who am I?”, you must embark on a journey of self-reflection. Take a moment to pause, detach yourself from external influences, and introspect. Explore your thoughts, emotions, and experiences. Consider what truly matters to you and what makes you unique. Reflect on your strengths, weaknesses, and the values that shape your decisions and actions. 2. Explore your passions and interests: Engaging in activities you enjoy and exploring your passions can provide valuable insights into your identity. Consider the hobbies, sports, or creative pursuits that bring you joy and fulfillment. These activities can often reveal your authentic self and shed light on your true passions and interests. 3. Evaluate your values and beliefs: Our values and beliefs form an integral part of our identity. Reflect on the principles and convictions that guide your life. What do you prioritize? What do you stand for? Analyzing your values and beliefs will help you gain clarity on what truly matters to you and contribute to your understanding of who you are. 4. Examine your relationships: Our relationships with others can provide valuable insights into our identity. Take a closer look at the people you surround yourself with and the dynamics of those relationships. How do you interact with others? What roles do you play in your relationships? Understanding how you relate to others can give you a deeper understanding of yourself. 5. Embrace self-acceptance: Answering the question “Who am I?” requires self-acceptance. Embrace all aspects of yourself, including your flaws and imperfections. Recognize that self-discovery is an ongoing process, and it’s okay to not have all the answers. Be patient with yourself and allow your identity to evolve naturally. Q: Is there a right or wrong answer to the question “Who am I?”\nA: No, there is no right or wrong answer. The question is subjective and personal. Your answer will be unique to your own experiences, values, and beliefs. Q: Can others answer the question “Who am I?” for me?

Why was it so difficult then, and why is it still so difficult today, to look at our lives and our environment with a critical lens on? The reason it is difficult is that when we look too closely at our lives, we discover that much of what we are experiencing is not what we had hoped it would be. Once we acknowledge this truth, we must then make an effort to either accept and adjust to harsh realities or begin to consider possible changes, both of which are difficult options. An even more common choice that many people make is to avoid thinking too much about what is happening to them or their world by masking their problems with all kinds of available drugs — constant new experiences, tranquilizers, food addictions, current fashionable drug and liquor choices that, in the end, do not solve problems but rather become harmful addictions in their own right and complicate their lives even more. What steps can be taken to break this destructive cycle? One of the first truths we must acknowledge is that transformation has never been an easy road to travel down. We have evolved into the individuals that we are today as a result of a variety of factors, including inborn traits as well as negative and positive experiences from our history. The bravery to examine some aspect of our personality that we have carried with us from our past and make the necessary adjustments is required. Losing our way\nWe must make certain that each day, each week, and each month contains some degree of balance between responsibility and relaxation, or else we risk losing our way. This sense of balance is critical to living a more fulfilling life. We must also re-evaluate our interpersonal interactions such that the majority of them provide us with a sense of fulfillment. If we require professional assistance in order to achieve all of these changes, we are fortunate to live in an era in which such assistance is widely available. The pursuit of happiness causes us to become more conscious of our surroundings and the impact they have on our lives, prompting us to try to make the world a better and happier place, because what happens in our community and around the world has an impact on our happiness as well as our well-being. It is ultimately a happier, more creative existence that allows us to function more lovingly both personally and socially, and that benefits not just ourselves, but also our families, our communities, and ultimately our entire planet.","passages":[{"passage":"I believe there are few things more valuable than building a meaningful philosophy on life. Although this may sound like a question best reserved for theologians and great thinkers, at the heart it is a practical question: What is your strategy for living? Your criteria may differ, but I believe all good life philosophies have four basic parameters:\n- Survival. Except in rare circumstances, most good philosophies will fulfill your basic needs. This usually isn’t a big concern since most of us are living well beyond the minimum threshold required to simply survive. - Happiness. Good life philosophies should make you feel good. Great philosophies will keep you happy even in troubling circumstances. Victor Frankl in his book, Man’s Search for Meaning, demonstrated how even in incredible suffering of the concentration camps he could still endure because of a powerful strategy for living. - Meaning. Happiness can rarely exist without meaning. Good philosophies should make you feel useful and valuable, otherwise when pleasurable moments fade you are left with nothing. - Independence of Circumstance. Your life philosophy needs to apply in all situations and circumstances. Your strategy for deriving meaning and happiness should last even after a breakup, death of a relative or unemployment. Everyone has a philosophy on life, whether they realize it or not. The process of refining this philosophy is like building a ship. It will carry you in rough times and allow you to float easily during the pleasant moments. Here are some tips for refining your strategy on life:\n- Introspection. A life philosophy cannot be outsourced. Although many major religions package premade philosophies, the work of building a strategy for life is yours alone. Thinking about your beliefs and strategies is the only real way to do that. I recommend journaling or meditation to guide your thinking to come to real solutions. - Study other philosophies. Gather philosophies from other people and books. I try to be as broad as possible when exposing myself to other ways of thinking. I don’t believe you can be corrupted by a new way of thinking, so don’t limit yourself to exploring philosophies that only fit within your current expectations. - Focus on the answerable. Philosophy should be practical. This means focusing less on the unanswerable questions that just lead you in circles. I’m an atheist, but my opinion is that the question of whether there is a man in the clouds is besides the point. There is no grand truth, just now and experience. Answerable questions are like:\n- “What should I do to have a meaningful life?”\n- “How should I view painful moments so they don’t overwhelm me?”\n- “How should I act in relationships with other people?”\n- Don’t commit. Building a philosophy is an ongoing process of refinement, not an end result. I don’t ever expect to find a final answer, just increasingly better ones. My approach is to view any strategies I currently have as being the best available right now, but I am always open to new understandings. - Seek references. Experience can sculpt your strategy on life. I aim to find as many broad experiences as possible so I can use them as points of reference when developing a life philosophy. This doesn’t mean you need to smoke a lot of drugs or live in the wilderness, naked, for a year. Just that you shouldn’t limit yourself to the routine of your daily life. - Connect with others. Discuss your philosophy and find the philosophy of other people. I do my best to reserve judgment and simply observe. I’ve heard completely different philosophies on life from my own and each is a valuable source of new ideas. Don’t stop the flow by preaching or judging those with a different worldview. - Experiment. Philosophies need to be practical. They should affect how you think and what you do. Experiment with different approaches and see which connects best with the four criteria I mentioned above. - Collect new functions. Lenses and metaphors are an important component of a strategy for living. Read this article on building a library of thought functions to find more. - Hold conflicting ideas. I believe it was Aristotle who said, “it is the mark of an educated mind to hold two conflicting ideas in his head without accepting either.”\n- Be patient. I’m far from having a perfect strategy for living. I expect the process of refining a life philosophy will take decades, perhaps my entire life. There are no final answers, just slightly optimized ones.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:d424a615-dba1-4773-8a47-cb7ec443ec4c>"]},{"passage":"And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul.

The general answer that most philosophers would give is that it is necessary to lead an examined life.. A philosopher is a lover of (seeker after) wisdom. There a…re many different views about what living wisely or living well means. However, there is no way in advance to determine which view is correct.. Therefore, the only rational procedure is to examine the alternatives and select the one that seems best upon serious examination. Then test it. If it works well, that is the way to wisdom. If it does not work well, then test the next best view--and so on.. This explains why being a philosopher means living an examined life. It is not easy to admit that you do not have all the answers , and it's not easy to conduct a serious examination. However, there's also no better alternative.

Even though, intellectually, I know that life is to be lived, not to be questioned, emotionally, the question pulls me towards itself again and again. Recently, I’ve been thinking why is that the question keeps nagging and what can I do to settle it for some time. Digging a bit further, I realized that there are two parts to the question:\n- First: why do we keep questioning what is the meaning of life? - Second: why don’t we ever get satisfied with an answer? Why do we keep questioning? One insight comes from evolutionary biology: our ancestors who were curious did better, survived more, and had more descendants than the ones who didn’t question things. Our drive for information foraging is evolutionarily advantageous. The entire bedrock of Science is this unceasing questioning about why something happened. Why don’t we get an answer? Our drive for questioning comes from trying to understand the world around us. We ask why did the rain happen because we want to control it. The answer to a ‘why’ question in the world necessarily includes a cause and an effect. Our thinking ability is shaped by our intuition about physics and that intuition says things have causes and effects. The cause-and-effect structure of our thinking is so fundamental that even babies perceive the world that way. This causal mode of thinking has served us very well in most domains where we’ve applied. However, when we apply it to our\nAn answer to this question is fundamentally unthinkable because our thinking requires a cause-and-effect. As I wrote in the review of the book The Outer Limits of Reason, this strong feeling that everything must have a cause and effect is so ingrained that we have trouble accepting the randomness of quantum mechanics. If we cannot bring ourselves to accept that the position of an electron could be arbitrary, how can we come to accept the felt arbitrariness of life? We feel that there must be a hidden variable explaining this arbitrariness. Another difficulty accepting an answer to the question of life is that it’s trivial to negate the answer by acting or imagining to act opposite to what the answer suggests. If a guru says life’s purpose is in helping others, why does eating ice cream feel so good? To reiterate, I feel the answer to what’s the meaning of life is unthinkable because thinking implies cause-and-effect chains and in first person perspective, there is no necessary cause or effect. We can’t find meaning in our life because we feel like free agents. This confusion, like most philosophical confusions, arise from confused language use. Philosophers call it the category error. (For a further deep-dive on this, see my earlier essay: philosophy is politics.) Either we can give up being free or we can give up questioning life. But giving up either is hard\nYou bet it is. So what is one supposed to do? Do you notice a contradiction when you use the word ‘supposed’ in\nThe only thing I can advice is that be suspicious of anyone who claims to have an answer.

Note that I'm not asking what you believe, necessarily. I'm asking what you know, and how you apply that knowledge every day, and what effects does the application of that knowledge have. For instance, do you have a core lesson you learned years ago from a significant life experience? How has that lesson shaped the way you live your life, how you interact with other people, and how you get things done? What decisions do you make because of that lesson, and how do the effects of those decisions ripple outward? Can you point to specific ways that you or someone else has benefited from your lessons? How does your decision-making process made the world a better (or worse) place? I know that I don't know all there is to know. I know that I can learn something even from those with whom I disagree. I know I have been loved unconditionally and that that has made the biggest difference in my life. I know there are many things in this world that cannot be seen or sensed with our unassisted senses, so I am open to possibilities that transcend my experience. Therefore, I have made it my philosophy to have a tolerant, open-minded, humble approach toward life and individuals and knowledge. I have made it my philosophy to love everyone as I am able and desire the best life has in store for them as they learn, grow, change and fulfill their potentials. I have made it my philosophy to make a difference for good in the world through random and intentional acts of kindness, love and charity. I realize that choices that I make set in motion far-reaching influences and effects that will touch many people in helpful or unhelpful ways, so I try to be conscientious about the choices I make. I should add that I fail miserably in these ideals all too often, but as an eternal optimist and positive thinker, I take the lessons to heart and go forward with a resolve to do better with the next choice. It's important to point out that I do not view choices simply as a response to the situations foisted upon me by life's circumstances, but that I can take a pro-active approach to making choices at any time as I think of ways to live out the ideals of my philosophy. My greatest success story is the influence my philosophy has had upon my sons. I have helped them become responsible, sensitive, loving young men who have also worked hard to gain knowledge and wisdom. It's sincerely gratifying to me to see what they have become. Again, I've had my failures, but I have talked openly with my sons about them and have helped them to learn from my mistakes as I have learned, also. Beyond my sons, I am certain that my friendly, helpful attitude toward co-workers and others I meet during the day makes a positive difference in at least some cases, which may very well set in motion a ripple effect that touches others in a positive way. answered 10 Nov '09, 07:17\nOne of my personal philosophies in life is not to make too much of a big deal about bad things that happen to me. I will treat everything as an opportunity to learn and make sure that the unwanted thing does not happen to me again but I will not stress over it or get depressed over it. Anything that happens to me, I know I have attracted and I have the power to change it by changing my vibration. It has become easier and easier for me to deal with unexpected and unwanted things that happen in life. I have had health problems in the past which I thought would never be cured but by applying the principles I know about the law of attraction, I found a way to get better and healthy again. But the reason I got the health problems in the first place was because I used to get depressed and worked up about a lot of things in my life. So, I have a less serious approch to life now. I try and find the positive aspects of everything that happens to me everyday. And just have more fun and enjoy the ride. answered 11 Nov '09, 20:32\nIf you are seeing this message then the Inward Quest system has noticed that your web browser is behaving in an unusual way and is now blocking your active participation in this site for security reasons.

Quite frankly, I am would be totally shocked and surprised, that any body beside me would think this way as well. Why do things happen the way they do? Why so some children suffer while others are spoiled with wealth? Why do some children fail school while others pass? Why does someone get all hundreds in math and eighties in English? Answer to the question \"why do things happen the way they do? \", and a question \"Why is it so hard to fix all of these problems we face in, sadly, everyday life\", it is because (I personally believe) that everything happens for a reason. Because everything happens for a reason, although we may not always realize what the reason is. for example, if you have been taking swimming lessons for five months and you still are clueless in how to swim, it may just be because you were simply to destined to learn how to swim, still, there is no harm in trying. I have another question too, \"why do most humans harm other living beings?\" does an insect not hold the same importance as a king? Why? Why do most human beings not think about that chicken's family before they eat it?

It is specifically looking for available safety data on 18- to 20-year-old drivers who operate commercial vehicles in intrastate commerce, where drivers this age are currently allowed to operate. This is an effort years in the making. The FMCSA said it was petitioned to consider this change as far back as October 2, 2000 when the Truckload Carriers Association asked the agency to consider such a pilot. The FMCSA held a public comment period the next year and received 1,600 comments, with 90% of them opposed to the idea on the basis younger drivers lack the maturity for the job, the agency explained in its Federal Register posting. \"None explained how interstate drivers under 21 would diminish safety when most States have concluded that intrastate drivers under 21 do not do so,\" FMCSA said of the 2001 comments. \"Very few truck drivers and motor carriers commented, but most of them also opposed the pilot program.\" The petition was denied in 2003.\n\nAge: You must be at least 18 years old to obtain a Class A CDL, but you cannot engage in interstate commerce until you are at least 21 years old. 2. Driver's License: You must have a valid driver's license and a good driving record. 3. Medical Certification: You must provide a valid medical certificate that meets the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) medical standards. 4. Knowledge Tests: You must pass the general knowledge test and any applicable endorsement tests, such as air brakes and combination vehicles. 5.

Skills Test: You must pass a three-part skills test that includes pre-trip inspection, basic control skills, and an on-road driving test. 8. Fees: You must pay the required fees to obtain your Class A CDL license. It is important to note that additional requirements may apply depending on the type of commercial vehicle you plan to operate, such as endorsements for hazardous materials or passenger transport. It is important to note that some employers may have additional age requirements for their drivers, so it is important to check with potential employers to determine their specific hiring criteria. In Oregon, the following endorsements are available for Class A CDL holders:\n1. T - Double\/Triple Trailers: To pull double or triple trailers. 2. P - Passenger: To transport passengers in a commercial vehicle. 3. N - Tank Vehicle: To transport liquids or gases in bulk containers. 4. H - Hazardous Materials: To transport hazardous materials as defined by federal regulations. 5. X - Combination of Tank Vehicle and Hazardous Materials: To transport both hazardous materials and liquids or gases in bulk containers. If you plan to operate a commercial vehicle that requires any of these endorsements, you will need to pass additional knowledge tests and meet other requirements, such as background checks and fingerprinting. 1.

This includes checking the brakes, steering, lights, tires, and other components. 2.

Each part of the test is designed to evaluate your knowledge and skills related to operating a commercial vehicle safely and effectively.

Air Brake Restriction: If you have not passed the air brake knowledge test and skills test, you will have an \"L\" restriction on your license, which means you are not authorized to drive a commercial vehicle with air brakes. 2. Intrastate Only Restriction: If you do not meet the federal medical requirements or do not self-certify to operate in interstate commerce, you will have an \"O\" restriction on your license, which means you are only authorized to operate commercial vehicles within Oregon. 3. Automatic Transmission Restriction: If you take your skills test in a vehicle with an automatic transmission, you will have an \"E\" restriction on your license, which means you are not authorized to drive a commercial vehicle with a manual transmission. 4. Other restrictions: Depending on your driving history or other factors, you may have additional restrictions on your license, such as a restriction that limits you to driving during daylight hours or prohibits you from driving certain types of vehicles. It is important to understand and comply with any restrictions or limitations on your CDL license to avoid penalties or other consequences. However, it's important to note that the skills test and the pre-trip inspection test must be taken in English. This is because the CDL skills test requires clear communication between the examiner and the driver, and the pre-trip inspection test involves identifying and describing various components of a commercial vehicle using standard English terminology.\n\nThese requirements apply to both interstate and intrastate operations whose drivers are subject to the commercial driver’s license requirements found in Part 383 of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations.

There is a very easy method to get a CDL License in Illinois. Here is a step by step process on how to get it done. • There are age restrictions on who can get a CDL license. Unlike a standard driver’s license, the minimum age is 18 years old. If the desire is to get an interstate CDL license, the minimum age is 21 years old. For in-state driving, it is also necessary that the applicant is a resident of the state in which they are applying. • There is an application fee, and two different test fees, one for the knowledge test and one for the driving test. Make sure the amounts of the fees are known before arriving at the DMV. • While it is certainly legal to simply grab a training guide from the local DMV, it is not really advisable. It is a much better idea to enroll in a truck driving school such as Startruckdrivingschool.com. This is because there is much more to learn about driving than what can be gleaned from simply reading a book. While it is very important to also read the training manual, the learned experience that a school staffed with ex-drivers can share is priceless. • The school will have the potential driver initially practice driving with the instructors and eventually with other students. This aids in gaining real world experience of how to handle a big rig on the road. After the required number of hours on the road are met, the driver will be able to officially apply for a CDL license. The test will be both a written test and a formal driving test. If the applicant is enrolled in school, the institution will provide the vehicle. If the applicant is going directly to the DMV, they will have to provide the truck themselves. Passing the test and getting the CDL License in Illinois is a great way to start a career that is always in demand. There will always be a need for goods to trucked across the country and learning to drive a truck is the first step into getting that job done. Connect with us on Google+!

Different rules and laws apply to the road so being aware of these before you drive on them is a good idea. Each state has a different set of road rules\nThe US is a big place and is home to a whopping 50 states. Each state has its own set of driving rules and laws and knowing how these differ from state to state is highly important. Many of the rules remain the same, but some of them do vary a bit so you should check when you pick up your RV rental for these variations. The maximum highway speed in most states is 65 miles per hour, unless otherwise indicated. These speed limits are strictly enforced by radar in most states. As a general rule, the minimum age for driving in most states is 16, yet some states restrict driving until drivers are 18 years of age. Some campervan rental companies charge additional fees for drivers under the age of 25. Nearly every state in America has laws that make it illegal to drive without a seat belt on. Seat belts must be worn by the driver and all passengers, and some states even require special child restraint seats for all young children. In USA each State has its own laws with regards to child restraints. For the safety of your children we recommend that any child under the age of 8 must wear an approved, properly fastened and adjusted child restraint. For all of those out there who have radar detectors built into their GPS units, be careful in which states you use this function. While some states allow you to use them, others do not and you may be fined if you are using one illegally. In some areas, the police are more particular on enforcing the law, especially in school areas, in which is the speed limit is 15 miles per hour, and also around school buses, especially when their lights are flashing. Police will also come down heavy on your for drink driving, which is strictly prohibited in all states. US Highway System\nThe highways in the US are often referred to as \"interstate highways\" or state maintained roads. While some of them do have tolls, most are free, allowing for smooth sailing all the way along them. Major interstate highways running from north to south are ordered from I-5 to I-95, and east to west interstates are order from I-8 to I-10.

This is an effort years in the making. The FMCSA said it was petitioned to consider this change as far back as October 2, 2000 when the Truckload Carriers Association asked the agency to consider such a pilot. The FMCSA held a public comment period the next year and received 1,600 comments, with 90% of them opposed to the idea on the basis younger drivers lack the maturity for the job, the agency explained in its Federal Register posting. \"None explained how interstate drivers under 21 would diminish safety when most States have concluded that intrastate drivers under 21 do not do so,\" FMCSA said of the 2001 comments. \"Very few truck drivers and motor carriers commented, but most of them also opposed the pilot program.\" The petition was denied in 2003.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:4a625b4a-b6da-4404-a64e-07edd762be5d>"]},{"passage":"Age: You must be at least 18 years old to obtain a Class A CDL, but you cannot engage in interstate commerce until you are at least 21 years old. 2.

Medical Certification: You must provide a valid medical certificate that meets the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) medical standards. 4. Knowledge Tests: You must pass the general knowledge test and any applicable endorsement tests, such as air brakes and combination vehicles. 5. Commercial Learner's Permit (CLP): You must obtain a Commercial Learner's Permit (CLP) by passing the knowledge tests. 6. Training: You must complete behind-the-wheel training with a qualified instructor or employer, and practice driving with your CLP under the supervision of a licensed CDL holder. 7. Skills Test: You must pass a three-part skills test that includes pre-trip inspection, basic control skills, and an on-road driving test. 8. Fees: You must pay the required fees to obtain your Class A CDL license. It is important to note that additional requirements may apply depending on the type of commercial vehicle you plan to operate, such as endorsements for hazardous materials or passenger transport. It is important to note that some employers may have additional age requirements for their drivers, so it is important to check with potential employers to determine their specific hiring criteria. In Oregon, the following endorsements are available for Class A CDL holders:\n1. T - Double\/Triple Trailers: To pull double or triple trailers. 2. P - Passenger: To transport passengers in a commercial vehicle. 3. N - Tank Vehicle: To transport liquids or gases in bulk containers. 4. H - Hazardous Materials: To transport hazardous materials as defined by federal regulations. 5. X - Combination of Tank Vehicle and Hazardous Materials: To transport both hazardous materials and liquids or gases in bulk containers. If you plan to operate a commercial vehicle that requires any of these endorsements, you will need to pass additional knowledge tests and meet other requirements, such as background checks and fingerprinting. 1. Pre-Trip Vehicle Inspection: You will be asked to perform a thorough inspection of your vehicle to ensure that it is safe to operate. This includes checking the brakes, steering, lights, tires, and other components. 2. Basic Vehicle Control: You will be asked to demonstrate your ability to control your vehicle in a variety of situations, such as backing up, turning, and maneuvering through a course. 3. On-Road Driving: You will be asked to drive your vehicle on public roads while demonstrating your ability to follow traffic laws, merge safely onto highways, change lanes, and make turns. Each part of the test is designed to evaluate your knowledge and skills related to operating a commercial vehicle safely and effectively. It is important to practice and prepare for the test by studying the Oregon Commercial Driver Manual and getting hands-on experience with a qualified instructor or mentor. 1. Air Brake Restriction: If you have not passed the air brake knowledge test and skills test, you will have an \"L\" restriction on your license, which means you are not authorized to drive a commercial vehicle with air brakes. 2. Intrastate Only Restriction: If you do not meet the federal medical requirements or do not self-certify to operate in interstate commerce, you will have an \"O\" restriction on your license, which means you are only authorized to operate commercial vehicles within Oregon. 3. Automatic Transmission Restriction: If you take your skills test in a vehicle with an automatic transmission, you will have an \"E\" restriction on your license, which means you are not authorized to drive a commercial vehicle with a manual transmission. 4. Other restrictions: Depending on your driving history or other factors, you may have additional restrictions on your license, such as a restriction that limits you to driving during daylight hours or prohibits you from driving certain types of vehicles. It is important to understand and comply with any restrictions or limitations on your CDL license to avoid penalties or other consequences. However, it's important to note that the skills test and the pre-trip inspection test must be taken in English. This is because the CDL skills test requires clear communication between the examiner and the driver, and the pre-trip inspection test involves identifying and describing various components of a commercial vehicle using standard English terminology.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:717ef48f-dfee-437e-b1fd-53ac481e4736>"]},{"passage":"These requirements apply to both interstate and intrastate operations whose drivers are subject to the commercial driver’s license requirements found in Part 383 of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations.

The BMV oversees all schooling for commercial drivers in Indiana to assure that they offer top-quality instruction and have qualified teachers. Although enrolling in a program for extra CDL training is highly encouraged by the BMV, it is not one of the requirements for receiving a CLP or full license.

There is a very easy method to get a CDL License in Illinois. Here is a step by step process on how to get it done. • There are age restrictions on who can get a CDL license. Unlike a standard driver’s license, the minimum age is 18 years old. If the desire is to get an interstate CDL license, the minimum age is 21 years old. For in-state driving, it is also necessary that the applicant is a resident of the state in which they are applying. • There is an application fee, and two different test fees, one for the knowledge test and one for the driving test. Make sure the amounts of the fees are known before arriving at the DMV. • While it is certainly legal to simply grab a training guide from the local DMV, it is not really advisable. It is a much better idea to enroll in a truck driving school such as Startruckdrivingschool.com. This is because there is much more to learn about driving than what can be gleaned from simply reading a book. While it is very important to also read the training manual, the learned experience that a school staffed with ex-drivers can share is priceless. • The school will have the potential driver initially practice driving with the instructors and eventually with other students. This aids in gaining real world experience of how to handle a big rig on the road. After the required number of hours on the road are met, the driver will be able to officially apply for a CDL license. The test will be both a written test and a formal driving test. If the applicant is enrolled in school, the institution will provide the vehicle. If the applicant is going directly to the DMV, they will have to provide the truck themselves. Passing the test and getting the CDL License in Illinois is a great way to start a career that is always in demand. There will always be a need for goods to trucked across the country and learning to drive a truck is the first step into getting that job done. Connect with us on Google+!

Different rules and laws apply to the road so being aware of these before you drive on them is a good idea. Each state has a different set of road rules\nThe US is a big place and is home to a whopping 50 states. Each state has its own set of driving rules and laws and knowing how these differ from state to state is highly important. Many of the rules remain the same, but some of them do vary a bit so you should check when you pick up your RV rental for these variations. The maximum highway speed in most states is 65 miles per hour, unless otherwise indicated. These speed limits are strictly enforced by radar in most states. As a general rule, the minimum age for driving in most states is 16, yet some states restrict driving until drivers are 18 years of age. Some campervan rental companies charge additional fees for drivers under the age of 25. Nearly every state in America has laws that make it illegal to drive without a seat belt on. Seat belts must be worn by the driver and all passengers, and some states even require special child restraint seats for all young children. In USA each State has its own laws with regards to child restraints. For the safety of your children we recommend that any child under the age of 8 must wear an approved, properly fastened and adjusted child restraint. For all of those out there who have radar detectors built into their GPS units, be careful in which states you use this function. While some states allow you to use them, others do not and you may be fined if you are using one illegally. In some areas, the police are more particular on enforcing the law, especially in school areas, in which is the speed limit is 15 miles per hour, and also around school buses, especially when their lights are flashing. Police will also come down heavy on your for drink driving, which is strictly prohibited in all states.

While some of them do have tolls, most are free, allowing for smooth sailing all the way along them.

Packed with plenty of attitude, the game's combination of\nsim elements and arcade hijinks sets it apart from the rest of the field\nOne of Crimson Skies' biggest assets is the universe that it is set\nin. Starting off as an air-combat based board game, the world of Crimson Skies\nis intricately detailed and well chronicled. Everything about the game, from\nthe characters to the movies to the sound, simply screams romantic era 1930's\nYou are Nathan Zachary, the heroic Robin Hood of the skies. With your band\nof merry men and women known as the Fortune Hunters, you'll fly over 24 missions\nto defend justice, honor, and a fat wallet. I mean, what is piracy without a\nlittle booty here and there? The FMV cut scenes lend a hand in creating the tone of the game by taking on\nfeel of watching an old feature film from Hollywood's early days. Run in black\nand white with all the static of the old films, these movie sequences are like\nsomething out of a History Channel documentary. With all this good stuff going for it, the only thing that could shoot down\nthis game would be bad gameplay. Fortunately, gameplay is where Crimson Skies\ntruly soars. In much the same way as the Playstaion smash hit Driver,\nthe game does a marvelous balancing act between flight sim realism and in-your-face,\nfrantic action. Players can jump into the thick of things without reading volumes\nupon volumes of flight manuals. While you don't need to boggle your mind with\nthoughts of ailerons and HUD's, you do need to watch out for engine stalls and\nthat pesky gravity, which will cancel your flight faster than a rogue hurricane\noff the Florida coast. This is definitely a game for gamers, not flight school\nall this goodness isn't enough, the Crimson Skies crew keeps it coming. The game runs on a tweaked version of the Combat Flight Sim engine\nto bring you some superior visuals. The graphics are excellent, with smooth\ntextures and plenty of details everywhere. You'll see your plane take damage\nand catch fire when the action gets hot and heavy, witness wing flaps move as\nyour plane changes directions, and delight as stray shots hitting the water\nsend splashes skyward. As you progress through the missions, you'll gain money that can be put towards\nthe purchase of your very own custom plane. We're not just talking about a new\ncoat of paint, we're talking about a choice of engine, armor, style and payload. Of course, your new frame must be able to support the weight of it all, so don't\nget too carried away. For those of you that just want to jump into the fray without any of this\n\"story\" business, Crimson Skies also includes an Instant Action mode. Want to dogfight a squadron of enemy fighters? No problem. Try to hijack a zeppelin? You got it. If time is short or you just feel like blowing stuff up, this mode\nhas what it takes to fulfill all your piratical needs. The game's music also immerses you completely in a 1930's mindset with authentic\nsounding swing music. The Grade-A voice acting is terrific as well.\n\nI was able to play a few levels at a Capcom event yesterday and also bring a build to the office, giving me a look at a few levels from various bits of the game as well as the opening sequences. The game starts off with you playing as soldier, testing out a new Tesla-designed rocket pack. Of course, no game would be complete without a sneak attack by the enemy, so a group of UFOs show up to give you an introduction to the game's flight mechanics. After dispatching a group of them, the character you start with looks to be killed and you then take control of the game's protagonist, Will, about a week later. By default, the flight controls are inverted to act like regular plane controls, while the ground combat is not, which for me helps make it feel a little more separated. If you've played Crimson Skies, you'll be familiar with a lot of the dual-stick clicking special moves, like flip reversals and dodges. This isn't very surprising as the Airtight Games team was formed from the dissolved staff that worked on Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge, and their experience shows through nicely as the controls are smooth, responsive and relatively easy to use. This sequence, which I also had a chance to play at the event as there's a nearly identical (but much more extended) sequence later in the game, takes place near a cliff side overlooking an ocean. Large rock pillars give you plenty of things to dodge and use for cover during the battle to make it more interesting than open air. In the prologue, you basically just take down a couple ships and then get put out of your misery. When you return later as Will, after you clear the skies you'll need to turn your attention to some ground troops. One cool bit to the game is that the flying and ground-based mechanics are blurred by your ability to hover. When you do this, you're still airborne and can travel in six directions (albeit much more slowly than standard flight), but you also have total control over where you're shooting rather than just in front of you. The game encourages you to make use of your hovering ability as the enemies will have a harder time picking you out of the sky than if you're standing on solid ground. Since I had just jumped right into this sequence (the first thing I played was the second time in the part, playing as Will), switching between flying, standing on solid ground and hovering took some getting used to strictly in a button command sense (I can't even remember how to do it offhand), though I imagine that when you actually run through the game this'll be much more natural by this point. While the flight bits feel a lot like Crimson Skies (which is great), the ground combat is very much akin to what you'll find in a lot of third-person shooters these days, which makes it easy to jump right into. You can take cover and then fire blindly, aim down your sights with some guns and generally go about things like you would in something like Uncharted or Gears of War. Again though, what makes this unique is the ability to take to the skies at pretty much any time and change up the way you take on combat. You won't always have flight, though. Early on in the game, once you take control of Will, you'll be on foot and fighting enemies in a more \"classic\" sense until you eventually find the jet pack. This opening sequence takes place in the jungle, and while you won't find the sort of platforming bits to do ala Uncharted, it does make for a rather stark contrast to the more mechanical stuff you'll see later on. An example of this is a cylindrical generator shaft that you'll come to later where you're tasked with shutting down the power. Blue electrical bolts fly pretty much everywhere here, and the deep chasm formed by the shaft means that you'll have to make use of your hover ability a lot during combat. Dark Void is set to ship early next year. In the meantime, take a look at our media pages for new screens and video, and keep your eyes peeled for details on how you can win a Tesla Roadster as part of a promotional giveaway that Capcom is holding for the game.\n\n\"Grant Howitt's games are always strong on play experiences.

The sort of game experience that’s not just fun, but actually rewarding to play.\" - Gav Thorpe, author of Inquisitor and, like, half the Warhammer 40k universe\nWHAT IS THE SPIRE? Spire is a new stand-alone roleplaying game from the designers of Unbound and Goblin Quest. It’s like D&D crossed with Unknown Armies, or Gormenghast crossed with Necromunda: a city-bound fantasy horror game of terrible decisions, hard choices, and deeply personal loss. Spire is a city of a thousand gods: Our Glorious Lady, the light of the moon, beloved of the drow (and her sisters, the dark side of the moon and the eclipse, whose worship is banned by the high elves); the Solar Pantheon, great and terrible, who dominate the city from glittering cathedrals; the ravenous Hungry Deep that slumbers beneath the city; the laughing carrion god Charnel, whose hyenas prowl the bloody streets of New Heaven. Worship of these gods can grant miracles to the faithful - player characters included. It is a place of industry and profit: human retro-engineers arrive with armfuls of arcane technology dug up from forgotten dungeons of a lost civilisation, then hotwire them into life and sell cheap copies down in the lawless undercity. There are acres of underground lakes brimming with algae; dark farms where the dead hang from spidersilk, their bodies dotted with fungi; and the vast, cursed, never-completed Vermissian, a failed attempt at a subterranean travel network. It is a place of horror, too: bloodwitches return from the Heart, the rotten hole in reality that is the centre of Spire, carrying mystical blood diseases that rewrite men’s minds; spider-skinned midwives sprout additional chitinous limbs to defend unborn drow; magic masks are sutured to unwilling faces; hearts are plucked out and stored in jars, so that the owner might have eternal, strange life at the hands of the Morticians.\n\nBecause I was so intrigued by this title I wanted to know a bit more about the game so I also asked a couple of other questions regarding gameplay and the overall look of the game. Q: Can you describe a bit about how the game will play? With so many references to other game titles, it leaves me wondering what the gameplay style will be like. A: The game will be divided in two parts: the action sequences, and the question sequences. In the action sequences, you control Jeanne like in a regular platformer. You can climb ladders and walls, look at some elements in the background, talk with NPC and so on. There is no inventory, only a stamina\/life gauge that you’ll have to look for. The more you run, climb and fall from high heights, the more Jeanne will be exhausted, which can be annoying if you’re chased by an enemy. Those action sequences will also probably include some infiltration mechanics. The question sequences will pop up (kind of) randomly during the game. A question will be asked to Jeanne and depending on the player’s answer (among 2 choices), the game and scenario will take some new orientations. The thing is, we don’t talk about 10 or 20 questions in the whole game, but around 300. Theses questions will act like a psychological test on the game and will also be a way for me to tell the story. After answering a question, the player will be sent to another action sequence and so on. Q: The screens that you included in your press kit are all very intriguing! It looks as if the game will take place across many different areas. Would you like to go into any detail about the various areas available to players? A: To be perfectly true, I’m still searching what “kind” of horror I will push, and I really don’t know yet if all the visuals I sent you will be in the final game. I’m still searching, now I’m just throwing out ideas, and I’ll see which ones I’ll keep on the way. The things I can say for sure are:\n– The action will take place in a “kind of” European city (mostly inspired by Paris and Italian cities like Milan or Rome). – There won’t be any zombies in it or Silent Hill-esque monsters. I’d prefer to look more in esoteric themes. – Jeanne is an actress, so yeah, some sequences will take place in theaters or on movie sets. – The pyramid on the moon will be one of the key places of the story. There is no denying that the gameplay mechanics sound interesting. I’m digging the bits about her becoming exhausted even if that could happen at inopportune moments. We will definitely keep up with Jeanne as the game is being developed and see what sort of look the game will ultimately take on, and the various locations that will be available to players. Checkout the trailer and be sure to let us know what you think!\n\nIn this post I will talk about the future features of the game and ideas of mine. Feel free to comment! One of my goal is, that the game should be 2-3 hours long. I believe that is a huge amount of work but I am optimistic that I can do it. The game is not an open world game. It is level based like Cry of Fear. You go to a door, press “e” and you load the next level. You can also go back to see if you missed something. If you think of Cry of Fear, there was an inventory system. This won’t be in Obscuritas. The only things you will be able to pick up are keys and notes. As it is usual in a horror game, there will be some evil stuff in the game, like scares. Therefore Obscuritas is more an interactive story than an “real” FPS. While you play you discover more and more about Vincent and what happened to him. Of course there will be some things you can do and you also should feel scared while you play it. For now that’s all I want to tell. I will write development diaries when I have done enough for one. That’s why you should stay tuned to me and my game. You can also read this on IndieDB:\n\nVincent has predicted this game might \"behave in some subtly strange ways online.\" (linky\nI'm not too worried. I think the game will play fine. We can, however, expect some rules discussion, so this thread is for that. From reading the rule clarification questions that have popped up in places, I see some advice and feedback that I think will help our on-line play. Tips\nWe should Describe Actions first; consequences are negotiated later. (Vincent, The Forge\nBe comfortable to back track slightly from described events. The above distinction (Action vs. consequences) might not be entirely clear at all times. If we find confusion, we might need to rewind a bit. Be prudent with your narrative power. Unless another character \"can and would try to interfere\" with the stated concrete action, we don't roll dice. Also, I'd like to put out some words of encouragement to keep the enthusiasm and posting pace going. Each post need not be some spectacular literary event. Any response is better than letting the game die. So don't hesitate to ask other players for input or ideas. Even just \"dialing it in\" on occasion to keep the story moving is perfectly fine with me.\n\nAmong the various aspects of Deep Shadows' action RPG that Alexander Khrutsky is asked about in this Xenus interview is what the gameplay will be like:\nThe gameplay in Xenus combines the features of two genres. The system of experience, number of parameters, system of weapons upgrade, the ability of communication with all characters, system of information or goods trade - all this is related to role part. Also the character can always turn to the special list of missions, read it or write new entries to the special diary. But, besides, Kevin will have to fight with different forces' representatives a lot, complete primary and secondary tasks - the first ones are important for the storyline, the second ones are completing if necessary. They can give some new interesting details or just help to earn money, or to gain some group's respect. There will be no division into levels or missions in the game. The entire game, completion of tasks, moving over the big localtion - all this takes place in real time. The response above mentions the main character, one Kevin Myers. The story involves his search for his sister, an investigative journalist who has gone missing in Colombia.\n\nPosted by: nickie\nWhat is new and fresh? - 03\/17\/04 01:08 PM\nI think you might agree that there are a lot of games that have involved Egypt in their theme.

Posted by: gatorlaw\nRe: What is new and fresh? - 03\/18\/04 10:45 AM\n[quote]Specific game play and story features of TEP are fantastic worlds, the use of magic, inspired from real magic in Ancient Egypt (the player collects spells in a specific inventory and must use them to progress in the adventure), a dreamlike story in which the player travels from realistic places to fantastic worlds, thanks to dreams and trances created with perfumes and incantations\n\n1. Name, Gender, and Background. This determines what everyone will call you, what gender specific clothing you can equip(there is a little bit), and what starting quest, reputation, and inventory you get. 3. Your characters appearance throughout the game. Be young, old, tattoo covered or hairless. You decide. 4. Your Statistics give certain bonuses or detriments depending on the number. They determine your skill totals, check passes and failures, and can be moved around to suit your personal play-style. Aside from the Grifter background, the points are pre-set to what the each backgrounds story will generally feel like. 5. Your attack and defense numbers, balanced out by your main combat skills, and a general idea of how effective you will be in a combat situation. 6. Your Combat Skills, placing points in these allow you to use a variety of weaponry with different effects, and avoid damage through dodging or blocking. Invest in combat skills to live through scenarios other characters would find impossible. 7. Your Civil Skills, placing points in these allow you to make your way through life by a variety of means. Be it through common thievery, a silver tongue, skills of creation or knowledge of old, not everyone has to learn to swing a sword.","passages":[{"passage":"- 1 player\n- 1 player\nTake the role of Sheriff Erika Wright as an investigation brings her to the small mining town of Bataille, where she is suddenly trapped by a ring of deadly, glowing towers encircling the community.

The thing is, we don’t talk about 10 or 20 questions in the whole game, but around 300. Theses questions will act like a psychological test on the game and will also be a way for me to tell the story. After answering a question, the player will be sent to another action sequence and so on. Q: The screens that you included in your press kit are all very intriguing! It looks as if the game will take place across many different areas. Would you like to go into any detail about the various areas available to players? A: To be perfectly true, I’m still searching what “kind” of horror I will push, and I really don’t know yet if all the visuals I sent you will be in the final game. I’m still searching, now I’m just throwing out ideas, and I’ll see which ones I’ll keep on the way. The things I can say for sure are:\n– The action will take place in a “kind of” European city (mostly inspired by Paris and Italian cities like Milan or Rome). – There won’t be any zombies in it or Silent Hill-esque monsters. I’d prefer to look more in esoteric themes. – Jeanne is an actress, so yeah, some sequences will take place in theaters or on movie sets. – The pyramid on the moon will be one of the key places of the story. There is no denying that the gameplay mechanics sound interesting. I’m digging the bits about her becoming exhausted even if that could happen at inopportune moments. We will definitely keep up with Jeanne as the game is being developed and see what sort of look the game will ultimately take on, and the various locations that will be available to players.

Feel free to comment! One of my goal is, that the game should be 2-3 hours long. I believe that is a huge amount of work but I am optimistic that I can do it. The game is not an open world game. It is level based like Cry of Fear. You go to a door, press “e” and you load the next level. You can also go back to see if you missed something. If you think of Cry of Fear, there was an inventory system. This won’t be in Obscuritas. The only things you will be able to pick up are keys and notes. As it is usual in a horror game, there will be some evil stuff in the game, like scares. Therefore Obscuritas is more an interactive story than an “real” FPS. While you play you discover more and more about Vincent and what happened to him. Of course there will be some things you can do and you also should feel scared while you play it.

As a guy, it’s easy for me to get wrapped up in the gee-whiz specifications of a product. See if these terms ring true for you:\n- Retina display\n- 1080p LCD digital display\n- 320 horsepower\n- 64 GB RAM\n- 0-60 in 4.8 seconds\n- .364 batting average\nWe’ve all seen lists like this. They often show up on websites for a product and are touted as the specifications that make you want to buy the product over a competing offering. But what does it all really mean? When I hold up one laptop computer’s specifications against those of another, I can definitely see the differences – but why should I care? When I went through my master’s degree studies, it became readily apparent of the differences between features and benefits. As my classmates would present their project or pitch, you began to understand which ones were compelling and which ones fell flat. The distinguishing characteristic, more often than not, was in the presenter’s understanding of features and benefits. Let’s look at this more closely. Features are like the specifications on the side of the box or on the product website. Features are what distinguish one product from all others in its space. A feature-rich product is one that we think of as full of the latest bells and whistles, and is often what drives the price of the product. Features are what product and software developers get hung up on quite often, and are what the naive salesperson pitches to their prospects. Lots of product packaging and advertising is consumed by the list of features. See our page on Features of Scrum. Benefits, on the other hand, are often not spelled out on a product’s label. Benefits, more than anything else, are what will compel a potential client or user to purchase a particular product. It is the overall value that they will derive from their experience with that product. For consumer-based products, the vast majority of manufacturers leave it to the purchaser to establish their own list of benefits. Quite often, all they have to gauge their assessment on is the list of features. If the consumer cannot understand what the feature does for them, then no benefit is perceived. The seasoned sales professional finds out what their customer wants and maps the features of their product to the benefits that the customer seeks. Check out out page on Benefits of Scrum. As a product owner on an Agile team, if you do not understand who your customer is, then you will have a hard time connecting features and benefits to their needs. That is why it is vital to know your customer and know their needs so that you can decide what goes in the product. Fortunately in Agile, there is a tool to help us accomplish just that – the user story. A good set of user stories make the connection between the features and benefits. User stories are in the form of “As a [role], I want [goal] so I can [reason].” For purposes of this blog, let’s rewrite this template as follows: “As a [customer], I want [feature] so I can [benefit].” This is critical to a successful product development process. You have to know why your customer might buy something before deciding what feature set to include in the product. Don’t overlook this critical component of the Agile process. Create good user stories and during your sprint reviews you’ll be able to connect features and benefits to the delight your customer.

As a guy, it’s easy for me to get wrapped up in the gee-whiz specifications of a product. See if these terms ring true for you:\n- Retina display\n- 1080p LCD digital display\n- 320 horsepower\n- 64 GB RAM\n- 0-60 in 4.8 seconds\n- .364 batting average\nWe’ve all seen lists like this. They often show up on websites for a product and are touted as the specifications that make you want to buy the product over a competing offering. But what does it all really mean? When I hold up one laptop computer’s specifications against those of another, I can definitely see the differences – but why should I care? When I went through my master’s degree studies, it became readily apparent of the differences between features and benefits. As my classmates would present their project or pitch, you began to understand which ones were compelling and which ones fell flat. The distinguishing characteristic, more often than not, was in the presenter’s understanding of features and benefits. Let’s look at this more closely. Features are like the specifications on the side of the box or on the product website. Features are what distinguish one product from all others in its space. A feature-rich product is one that we think of as full of the latest bells and whistles, and is often what drives the price of the product. Features are what product and software developers get hung up on quite often, and are what the naive salesperson pitches to their prospects. Lots of product packaging and advertising is consumed by the list of features. See our page on Features of Scrum. Benefits, on the other hand, are often not spelled out on a product’s label. Benefits, more than anything else, are what will compel a potential client or user to purchase a particular product. It is the overall value that they will derive from their experience with that product. For consumer-based products, the vast majority of manufacturers leave it to the purchaser to establish their own list of benefits. Quite often, all they have to gauge their assessment on is the list of features. If the consumer cannot understand what the feature does for them, then no benefit is perceived. The seasoned sales professional finds out what their customer wants and maps the features of their product to the benefits that the customer seeks. Check out out page on Benefits of Scrum. As a product owner on an Agile team, if you do not understand who your customer is, then you will have a hard time connecting features and benefits to their needs. That is why it is vital to know your customer and know their needs so that you can decide what goes in the product. Fortunately in Agile, there is a tool to help us accomplish just that – the user story. A good set of user stories make the connection between the features and benefits. User stories are in the form of “As a [role], I want [goal] so I can [reason].” For purposes of this blog, let’s rewrite this template as follows: “As a [customer], I want [feature] so I can [benefit].” This is critical to a successful product development process. You have to know why your customer might buy something before deciding what feature set to include in the product. Don’t overlook this critical component of the Agile process. Create good user stories and during your sprint reviews you’ll be able to connect features and benefits to the delight your customer.

Call them at 970-879-0825, email email@example.com... or visit the Extension Office, 136 Sixth St.\nLast week, I took a couple hikes on some of the trails that have finally dried out from snowmelt. All along the Hinman Fisherman’s Trail was one of my favorite early season flowers, the Glacier lily (Erythronium grandiflorum). This exquisite and delicate small flower features curved yellow petals with stamens that protrude from the flower’s center. The leafless stems are 6 to 12 inches long and bend at the top giving the flower an elegant drooping profile.\nAlso called dogtooth violet and snow lily, glacier lilies provide early season food for much wildlife in our area, including bears, deer and elk who eat the corms (the swollen underground part of the stem that stores energy for next year — not quite a bulb, but close) and green seed pods, as will sheep and cattle. Ground squirrels and other rodents dig up the corms and store them for winter consumption.\nAlthough it is a really pretty flower that would look great in a meadow or garden, it generally should not be dug up from its habitats in the wild as it sends its corms deep into the soil. Most of us would end up digging up only the leaves and their stems, killing the pretty plant.\nIt’s an edible plant, as well as a spring beauty. The corm is edible raw but tastier and easier to digest when cooked. The stems and leaves of glacier lilies are also edible, although less nutritious than the corms, and can sometimes be found adding a touch of color and texture to salad greens. The seedpod, which forms after the flower bloom has ended, is also edible and can be eaten raw or cooked. It tastes a little like green beans. As with any of these wild edible plants, it’s best to eat in moderation to avoid upsetting your stomach.\nLater in the week, I hiked the Sarvis Creek trail in the southern part of the county and was enchanted by all the Mountain Bluebells (Mertensia ciliata ) in bloom along the way. A member of the Boraginaceae (forget- me-not or borage) family, this widely dispersed perennial features a four-foot tall, three-foot wide plant with blue-green leaves that feature fine hairs (hence the name ciliata) and small, bell-shaped flower clusters that start out light blue and become pinkish purple as the flower ages. It’s usually found in wet meadows and along stream banks throughout the western U.S. and is sometimes found as a single plant but often as a whole colony along a stream or wet meadow. It’s an aromatic and beautiful early season flower.\nThe bell-shaped flowers are edible, as are the leaves, but the leaves aren’t very palatable raw with their hairy coating. Native Americans had medicinal uses for this plant.\nAs the weather turns nice, be sure to get out and see all the early-season wildflowers our part of the mountains feature during this short blooming season.\nDeb Babcock is a volunteer Master Gardener through the CSU Extension Routt County.\nSupport Local Journalism\nSupport Local Journalism\nReaders around Steamboat and Routt County make the Steamboat Pilot & Today’s work possible.

The edible parts of the Glacier lily are the bulbs, which are also known as \"dog's tooth violets\" or \"snowdrops.\"\n\nWhen prepared properly, the bulbs of the Glacier lily have a mild, sweet taste, often compared to that of a new potato or a young leek. They can be eaten raw, but they are typically cooked to enhance their flavor and make them more palatable.\n\nTo prepare the bulbs for eating, carefully peel off the papery skin, then you can boil, bake, or sauté them. When cooked, they have a soft, creamy texture. The flavor is subtle, with a slight sweetness that can be enhanced with seasonings like salt, pepper, butter, or herbs.\n\nIt's important to note that while the bulbs are edible, other parts of the Glacier lily plant are not safe to eat and can cause digestive upset.

Seen in almost every farm house's yard where I grew up. They lined the old railroad tracks where I played as a kid; we called them tiger lilies though I don't know why and stomped over them on our quest for black caps. They seemed to be everywhere except my own back yard. That is, until this year. After discovering last summer through Hank Shaw's blog that these common daylilies are edible, I had to give them a try. I found a patch of plants and cooked up a few buds and tubers and declared them delicious. Color me surprised! I figured they'd make a fine addition to our summer menu so I begged a patch of them off of my in-laws to plant in my own yard. They were more than happy to let me dig up a load of them because as anyone who has these knows, they grow (and spread) like weeds. Our lily patch is pretty small this year but we've been able to get a few harvests of buds so far. In a year or two I should have enough that I can start thinning them out and then I'll be able to harvest the root tubers, which taste like fingerling potatoes. For now we're enjoying our buds sauteed in butter with a little salt. For me they taste a bit like a cross between a green bean and asparagus. Cooked just briefly they have a nice texture too. Seriously, did I mention, oh yum? I recently read that you can pickle the buds, and I suppose they'd be good deep fried, (because like, what isn't? ), or tossed in stir fry. The whole plant is edible actually and I've already promised to deep fry the flowers for my son who loves, and has been deprived of this year, squash blossoms. I love having useful plants in the yard. How about you? per the Peterson Field Guide - Edible Wild Plants:\nOn identifying the edible day-lily \"Note the unspotted tawny blossoms (open 1 day only) facing upward from the top of a leafless flowerstalk.

Medicinal teas like black licorice flavored tea often feature Anise Hyssop.\n\nIf this happens, there are some effective methods for foraging for food and identifying edible plants. Those who escaped could find themselves in an survival situation that called for finding wild food. Often, Native American children were taught about edible plants from a young age. Most people today haven't had the same learning experience, and most people are likely to fail at finding wild food. You have to have to know how to correctly identify plants, and where they grow, and finally which parts of the plants are edible. You also have to know where to look for certain foods like mosses, nuts, and berries, and more calorie-rich foods like vegetables (such as potatoes and other teubers) and even fruit that can grow wildly, depending on your location. Be sure to include include \"Wildman\" Steve Brill's site in your research. Steve is an expert in the field of identifying safe and edible plants in the wild. He is a helpful resource and has designed several programs for organizations like the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, garden clubs, or any other group interested in learning more about edible plants. Steve even provides recipes that can be made using plants found in the wild. Surprisingly, there are a lot of options for recipes using edible wild foods and plants. Learning to identify which plants are safe and which are not before the need arises is an important skill to develop. Because this ability is so important, if you find yourself in a desperate situation and are unable to positively identify a food source as safe, the best course of action is to leave it alone. * Contaminated or stagnant water: Plants growing in this environment\nSign Up for our free email newsletter packed with survival tips and tips on preparing for widespread disaster. Topics covered include survival foods, martial law, government collapse, living off the land, self defense, survival hunting, survival fishing, and MORE...\n* Commercial and residential areas: There's a good chance that plants growing in these areas will have been contaminated with dangerous levels of toxic fertilizers and pesticides. (If this is your only option, ensure that you also have a source of clean water and rinse food you feed before eating). Mushrooms: They may look good on the store shelves, but the number and varieties of wild mushrooms that are poisonous or toxic are not worth the risk to your survival. Plants such as poison ivy and related plants grow with leaves that are grouped in threes. You may feel hungry enough to eat a plant that has thorns, but by no means consider them. Bitter tasting plants or those that smell like almonds are best to be avoided. Once you have identified a potential food source, the next step is to determine if the plant is edible. There is a universal edibility test that you can perform on plants to aid in identifying safe plants. 1. Separate the food in question into its basic parts. These include the leaves, roots, stems, buds and flowers (if present). As you are separating the plant, examine it closely for insects and other pests. 2. Crush the plant material (separately) and rub the individual parts on a separate part of your skin. Patience is key in this step as you will need to wait at least eight hours to determine if you develop a negative reaction. If you experience such things as swelling, burning, itching or redness, consider the plant inedible. If your plant passes this test, continue to the next step. 3. Hold the plant to your lips for up to three minutes. If there is no sensation such as itching, burning, or tingling, consider moving to the next step. If such sensations occur, stop here. 4. Taste a small portion of the plant by placing it on your tongue for up to fifteen minutes. Any unexpected and uncomfortable sensations are an indication that you should spit the sample out immediately and seek another source. If you continue to experience no ill effects, continue to the next step. (The actual taste of the sample is not necessarily indicative of its edibility. If you encounter a plant that does not suit your taste, but passes all these steps, it is up to you to decide if it is worth the taste to eat it). 5. Slowly chew the plant in your mouth and without swallowing, hold it in your mouth for another fifteen minutes.\n\nAnd like many other edible leaves, these are best sautéed or stir-fried. 14. Grape Leaves\nWhether you grow grapes or find wild grapes while foraging, don’t overlook the large leaves. Grape leaves are a staple in Mediterranean dishes. They are delicious stuffed with rice, couscous, meat, cheese, or other creative fillings. 15. The Apple Core\nLook, I’m just going to come right out and say it – we’ve been lied to, there is no core. This idea of throwing out the core is nonsense. There are only two parts of an apple that aren’t edible – the seeds and the stem. And if you know how to eat an apple properly, you will quickly realize that you’ve been throwing out ¼ of tasty apple your whole life. To eat an apple properly, start at the bottom and work your way up the top. Spit out the seeds as you come to them. If you do it right, all you’re left with is a few seeds and a stem. We’ve got an impressive list of vegetables that multitask with other edible parts. Give some of these a try. You’ll help with the problem of food waste, and you just might find a new favorite veggie. I’m betting it will be the roasted cauliflower leaves.\n\nThe yacon plant comes equipped with 2 sets of roots – larger ones for you to eat, smaller ones for planting. With roots and leaves full of antioxidants, the yacon is a most nutritious addition, especially to the diet of diabetics and weight-watchers. Another easy to plant vegetable is a legume, the winged bean; with its high protein supply. What makes it so worthwhile to grow is that every part of this plant is edible and delicious. The winged bean, rich in proteins, vitamins and minerals, offers a solution to countries with problems of malnutrition. More specifically, the young pods are an excellent way of replenishing your folate supply; the young leaves, for vitamins A and C and fiber, while the tubers, for proteins and vitamin B. Low in calories and cholesterol, these beans are so airy-fairy light to the point of being unsubstantial.Why Calcium Is Necessary For Our Body\nCalcium plays a vital role in the strengthening and the development of our bones. Calcium plays an important role in bone health and muscle contraction.Native Foods: Edible Flowers Of Tonkin Jasmine, Moringa, Banana, Papaya, Durian And Pumpkin\nEdible flowers, a nutritious food source are mostly overlooked in cooking, though they are more commonly used for cake decorations and in fruit and flower arrangements or bouquets To Jiao Mingyao, a cooking expert, the flowers of a plant can be eaten if the roots, stems, leaves and fruits of the plant are edible. In preparing edible flowers for cooking, he would first poach them in salt water before making a stir fry, soup or porridge with the flowers.You Eat What Your Food Ate! About 3500 years ago, the Israelites were given instructions about foods they should eat and foods they should avoid. These instructions were written in several places in the Bible, including in the book of Leviticus, chapter ll. Any fish you eat should have both fins and scales. Any animal you eat should chew the cud, part the hoof, and be cloven-footed.\n\n(also called Bulbus Lilii, or Lilium Brownii)\n- Lily bulb is a starchy, edible root vegetable that comes from the Lilium flowering plant family. It is used fresh as a vegetable in Chinese stir-frys or dried as a herbal remedy in Chinese medicine. - Fresh lily bulb is white in color. It has fleshy smooth petal-like layers that make up a bulb about the size of a whole garlic. - When dried, lily bulb turns a little yellowish like the ones in the photo above. - Fresh lily bulb has a light sweet taste and a crispy texture similar to that of the green sugar peas or the lotus root. - Lily bulb is typically gathered in the autumn, cleaned, then sun dried. Lily Bulb Health Benefits and Uses:\n- Lily bulb provides protein and starch. Additionally, they contain small amounts of calcium, iron, phosphorus, and vitamins B1, B2 and C.\n- In traditional Chinese medicine, lily bulb is considered sweet and cooling in properties. The herb is also associated to the lung and heart meridians and help to relieve coughs, dry throats, clear heat, and moisten the lung. Dried lily bulb is also used as an herb to calm the spirit, promote restful sleep, and lessen irritability. - Fresh and dried lily bulb can be used in both sweet dessert soups and savory soups in Chinese cooking. - See a list of my soup recipes using lily bulb. - To prepare fresh lily bulb, peel and wash the layers thoroughly in cold water before cooking. Since the bulb grows in mud, sand and muddy debris can be trapped in between the layers. - Dried lily bulb do not need much preparation. They are simply rinsed and used in cooking. - If making soups with dried lily bulb, note that over cooking will cause the dried petals to disintegrate, causing your soup a little cloudy or chalky. Follow your recipe for appropriate cook time. Where to Buy Lily Bulb:\n- Dried lily bulb can be found in many Chinese herbal stores and some Asian supermarkets. - Fresh lily bulbs are typically found in Asian supermarkets only in the produce section. Side Effects and Precautions:\n- As with all herbs, use in moderation and consult with a physician first. - According to traditional Chinese herbology, those with wind-cold or diarrehea should avoid using lily bulb.

They looked so vibrant and delicious-looking that I couldn’t help but be tempted. It turns out that had I given in to this temptation I would have been perfectly fine as the berries themselves aren’t poisonous, but the entire rest of the plant is (It’s reputed that some bowyers have died from handling too much yew wood while making bows). There are many plants in nature that rely on their toxicity to survive. Unfortunately, we humans are incapable of detecting this poison where the natural world has ways of telling. So we have to rely on our wits to help us avoid these plants. An easy (but tedious) way of determining a plants toxicity is to look for signs of other animals eating parts of it or observing the plant to see if any animals eat it. Some animals aren’t affected by poisons that affect humans so this doesn’t necessarily mean that it isn’t poisonous, it just makes it less likely to be poisonous. Universal Edibility Test\nIf you encounter a plant that you think may be safe to eat, you should conduct the Universal Edibility Test on it to ensure that it is, in fact, safe to eat. The UET minimizes your chances of being injured or dying from contacting a poisonous plant. It is a long and tedious process, but it could very well save your life. You must have an empty stomach at the start of the test so you need to fast for at least 8 hours before you start. - Separate the plant into five basic parts: leaves, roots, stems, buds, and flowers. Some plants have parts that are edible while the rest is poisonous (as with yew bushes). Separating each part lets you test the individual pieces to determine its edibility. - Rub a part of the plant on a bit of sensitive skin (wrist, inside of the knee or elbow, etc.) and wait eight hours. During the waiting period, you shouldn’t eat anything, but it is acceptable to drink water (and only water). Throughout the waiting period, watch out for a burning sensation, redness, welts, or bumps on the skin. These indicate that you are having a reaction to the plant, and if it affects your skin, it will affect your stomach. If you encounter any of these reactions, rinse your skin, wait 8 hours, and start the test over with a new piece of plant. - It has been shown that some toxins that were present in a plant raw were not present after boiling the plant. If you have the means to boil the plant, then do so. - Whether or not you boiled the plant, place the plant against your lips for three minutes. If you feel any burning or tingling, remove the plant, rinse your lips and start over with a new piece of plant. - Taste the plant for 15 minutes without chewing. If you experience burning, tingling or any other unpleasant sensations. Discard the plant, rinse your mouth, and start over with a new piece of plant. Remember that just because it tastes bad doesn’t mean it’s poisonous. - Chew the plant thoroughly and leave on your tongue for 15 minutes. DON’T SWALLOW! Again, if you experience any burning, numbness, or tingling spit out the plant, rinse your mouth, and start over with a new piece of plant. - Swallow the soggy, masticated bit of plant. Now you get to wait another eight hours while watching for signs of nausea. You can only drink water during this time. If your feel nauseous at any point during the 8 hours, induce vomiting and drink lots of water. - Eat about a quarter cup of the plant (specifically the part you have been testing) in the same manner as you’ve tested to this point (just without all the waiting). Once you get it all down, wait for adverse effects again for eight hours, only drinking water. If you feel sick, induce vomiting, drink lots of water and start over. At this point the plant part can be considered safe to eat, just don’t gorge on it.\n\nSkip to main content\nFood & Drinks\nFood Facts A to Z\nPoints of View\nBest Chefs in the World\nWho is Who\nCity Tasting Tour\nS.Pellegrino Young Chef\nAsia's 50 Best Restaurants\nSea grapes is the garnish that your salad needs\nThey pop when you bite into them and they taste like the sea.

Lost and Rare Fruits: Preserving the Past\n\nLeaves, flowers and bulbs of wild garlic all edible\nIn my neck of the woods, the past month has been a great time for Ramsons. It was also a great time of Dandelions and Three-cornered Garlic but not a great year for Bluebells. Ramsons and Three-cornered Garlic are both members of the large lily family. The genus or sub-division of the family that they are both members of is the onion genus and that group of plants comprises all the wild chives, onions, garlics and leeks. Even without bruising the leaves of Ramsons, it is impossible at this time of year to escape the scent of garlic in the air on a walk through a woodland carpeted with their white, star-shaped flowers. The true Garlic, beloved of some for seasoning and flavouring food, not to mention warding off vampires, is native to Central Asia and north-eastern Iran. It is cultivated in Ireland as a garden plant and horticultural crop and some throw-outs have managed to survive as casuals in the wild, mainly in coastal areas in the north-west. So, it is an alien introduction. The Three-cornered Garlic is also an alien introduction from abroad. Its native range is the western Mediterranean. It looks like a white bluebell, has a tree-cornered stems when rolled between finger and thumb, smells and tastes of garlic, and grows in profusions along roadside verges as a very invasive weed, mainly in the south and east of the country. Ramsons is our native wild garlic. Its range extends across Europe to the Caucasus and neighbouring Russia. In countries where wild boars occur these pigs root up the plants' very small bulbs and eat them as a source of food. Similarly, bears seek them out dig them up when they emerge from hibernation and that proclivity has given the plant its botanical name Allium ursinum, 'bears' onion'. Like the Three-cornered Garlic, Ramsons has tree-cornered stems when rolled between finger and thumb. It grows about knee-high. Its dark green leaves are long and pointed and its white-petalled flowers are borne in upright clusters. It thrives in damp, shaded areas and when suitable habitat occurs it can carpet the ground extensively. The leaves, flowers and bulbs of Ramsons are all edible and are used to make pesto, are eaten raw in salads and sandwiches or are cooked to make soup. The small green bulbs are sometimes used as a substitute for capers. While Ramsons is popular with people as a wild food, it is said to be toxic if eaten by dogs.","passages":[{"passage":"The ubiquitous orange daylily. Seen in almost every farm house's yard where I grew up. They lined the old railroad tracks where I played as a kid; we called them tiger lilies though I don't know why and stomped over them on our quest for black caps. They seemed to be everywhere except my own back yard. That is, until this year. After discovering last summer through Hank Shaw's blog that these common daylilies are edible, I had to give them a try. I found a patch of plants and cooked up a few buds and tubers and declared them delicious. Color me surprised! I figured they'd make a fine addition to our summer menu so I begged a patch of them off of my in-laws to plant in my own yard. They were more than happy to let me dig up a load of them because as anyone who has these knows, they grow (and spread) like weeds. Our lily patch is pretty small this year but we've been able to get a few harvests of buds so far. In a year or two I should have enough that I can start thinning them out and then I'll be able to harvest the root tubers, which taste like fingerling potatoes. For now we're enjoying our buds sauteed in butter with a little salt. For me they taste a bit like a cross between a green bean and asparagus. Cooked just briefly they have a nice texture too. Seriously, did I mention, oh yum? I recently read that you can pickle the buds, and I suppose they'd be good deep fried, (because like, what isn't? ), or tossed in stir fry. The whole plant is edible actually and I've already promised to deep fry the flowers for my son who loves, and has been deprived of this year, squash blossoms. I love having useful plants in the yard.

Those who escaped could find themselves in an survival situation that called for finding wild food. Often, Native American children were taught about edible plants from a young age. Most people today haven't had the same learning experience, and most people are likely to fail at finding wild food. You have to have to know how to correctly identify plants, and where they grow, and finally which parts of the plants are edible. You also have to know where to look for certain foods like mosses, nuts, and berries, and more calorie-rich foods like vegetables (such as potatoes and other teubers) and even fruit that can grow wildly, depending on your location. Be sure to include include \"Wildman\" Steve Brill's site in your research. Steve is an expert in the field of identifying safe and edible plants in the wild. He is a helpful resource and has designed several programs for organizations like the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, garden clubs, or any other group interested in learning more about edible plants. Steve even provides recipes that can be made using plants found in the wild. Surprisingly, there are a lot of options for recipes using edible wild foods and plants. Learning to identify which plants are safe and which are not before the need arises is an important skill to develop. Because this ability is so important, if you find yourself in a desperate situation and are unable to positively identify a food source as safe, the best course of action is to leave it alone. * Contaminated or stagnant water: Plants growing in this environment\nSign Up for our free email newsletter packed with survival tips and tips on preparing for widespread disaster. Topics covered include survival foods, martial law, government collapse, living off the land, self defense, survival hunting, survival fishing, and MORE...\n* Commercial and residential areas: There's a good chance that plants growing in these areas will have been contaminated with dangerous levels of toxic fertilizers and pesticides. (If this is your only option, ensure that you also have a source of clean water and rinse food you feed before eating). Mushrooms: They may look good on the store shelves, but the number and varieties of wild mushrooms that are poisonous or toxic are not worth the risk to your survival. Plants such as poison ivy and related plants grow with leaves that are grouped in threes. You may feel hungry enough to eat a plant that has thorns, but by no means consider them. Bitter tasting plants or those that smell like almonds are best to be avoided. Once you have identified a potential food source, the next step is to determine if the plant is edible. There is a universal edibility test that you can perform on plants to aid in identifying safe plants. 1. Separate the food in question into its basic parts. These include the leaves, roots, stems, buds and flowers (if present). As you are separating the plant, examine it closely for insects and other pests. 2. Crush the plant material (separately) and rub the individual parts on a separate part of your skin. Patience is key in this step as you will need to wait at least eight hours to determine if you develop a negative reaction. If you experience such things as swelling, burning, itching or redness, consider the plant inedible. If your plant passes this test, continue to the next step. 3. Hold the plant to your lips for up to three minutes. If there is no sensation such as itching, burning, or tingling, consider moving to the next step. If such sensations occur, stop here. 4.

They looked so vibrant and delicious-looking that I couldn’t help but be tempted. It turns out that had I given in to this temptation I would have been perfectly fine as the berries themselves aren’t poisonous, but the entire rest of the plant is (It’s reputed that some bowyers have died from handling too much yew wood while making bows). There are many plants in nature that rely on their toxicity to survive. Unfortunately, we humans are incapable of detecting this poison where the natural world has ways of telling. So we have to rely on our wits to help us avoid these plants. An easy (but tedious) way of determining a plants toxicity is to look for signs of other animals eating parts of it or observing the plant to see if any animals eat it. Some animals aren’t affected by poisons that affect humans so this doesn’t necessarily mean that it isn’t poisonous, it just makes it less likely to be poisonous. Universal Edibility Test\nIf you encounter a plant that you think may be safe to eat, you should conduct the Universal Edibility Test on it to ensure that it is, in fact, safe to eat. The UET minimizes your chances of being injured or dying from contacting a poisonous plant. It is a long and tedious process, but it could very well save your life. You must have an empty stomach at the start of the test so you need to fast for at least 8 hours before you start. - Separate the plant into five basic parts: leaves, roots, stems, buds, and flowers. Some plants have parts that are edible while the rest is poisonous (as with yew bushes). Separating each part lets you test the individual pieces to determine its edibility. - Rub a part of the plant on a bit of sensitive skin (wrist, inside of the knee or elbow, etc.) and wait eight hours. During the waiting period, you shouldn’t eat anything, but it is acceptable to drink water (and only water). Throughout the waiting period, watch out for a burning sensation, redness, welts, or bumps on the skin. These indicate that you are having a reaction to the plant, and if it affects your skin, it will affect your stomach. If you encounter any of these reactions, rinse your skin, wait 8 hours, and start the test over with a new piece of plant. - It has been shown that some toxins that were present in a plant raw were not present after boiling the plant. If you have the means to boil the plant, then do so. - Whether or not you boiled the plant, place the plant against your lips for three minutes. If you feel any burning or tingling, remove the plant, rinse your lips and start over with a new piece of plant. - Taste the plant for 15 minutes without chewing. If you experience burning, tingling or any other unpleasant sensations. Discard the plant, rinse your mouth, and start over with a new piece of plant. Remember that just because it tastes bad doesn’t mean it’s poisonous. - Chew the plant thoroughly and leave on your tongue for 15 minutes. DON’T SWALLOW! Again, if you experience any burning, numbness, or tingling spit out the plant, rinse your mouth, and start over with a new piece of plant. - Swallow the soggy, masticated bit of plant. Now you get to wait another eight hours while watching for signs of nausea. You can only drink water during this time. If your feel nauseous at any point during the 8 hours, induce vomiting and drink lots of water. - Eat about a quarter cup of the plant (specifically the part you have been testing) in the same manner as you’ve tested to this point (just without all the waiting). Once you get it all down, wait for adverse effects again for eight hours, only drinking water. If you feel sick, induce vomiting, drink lots of water and start over. At this point the plant part can be considered safe to eat, just don’t gorge on it.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:1ad08423-e58f-43c6-8b2f-b9fd02de8ccb>"]},{"passage":"Skip to main content\nFood & Drinks\nFood Facts A to Z\nPoints of View\nBest Chefs in the World\nWho is Who\nCity Tasting Tour\nS.Pellegrino Young Chef\nAsia's 50 Best Restaurants\nSea grapes is the garnish that your salad needs\nThey pop when you bite into them and they taste like the sea.

It was also a great time of Dandelions and Three-cornered Garlic but not a great year for Bluebells. Ramsons and Three-cornered Garlic are both members of the large lily family. The genus or sub-division of the family that they are both members of is the onion genus and that group of plants comprises all the wild chives, onions, garlics and leeks. Even without bruising the leaves of Ramsons, it is impossible at this time of year to escape the scent of garlic in the air on a walk through a woodland carpeted with their white, star-shaped flowers. The true Garlic, beloved of some for seasoning and flavouring food, not to mention warding off vampires, is native to Central Asia and north-eastern Iran. It is cultivated in Ireland as a garden plant and horticultural crop and some throw-outs have managed to survive as casuals in the wild, mainly in coastal areas in the north-west. So, it is an alien introduction. The Three-cornered Garlic is also an alien introduction from abroad. Its native range is the western Mediterranean. It looks like a white bluebell, has a tree-cornered stems when rolled between finger and thumb, smells and tastes of garlic, and grows in profusions along roadside verges as a very invasive weed, mainly in the south and east of the country. Ramsons is our native wild garlic. Its range extends across Europe to the Caucasus and neighbouring Russia. In countries where wild boars occur these pigs root up the plants' very small bulbs and eat them as a source of food. Similarly, bears seek them out dig them up when they emerge from hibernation and that proclivity has given the plant its botanical name Allium ursinum, 'bears' onion'. Like the Three-cornered Garlic, Ramsons has tree-cornered stems when rolled between finger and thumb. It grows about knee-high. Its dark green leaves are long and pointed and its white-petalled flowers are borne in upright clusters. It thrives in damp, shaded areas and when suitable habitat occurs it can carpet the ground extensively. The leaves, flowers and bulbs of Ramsons are all edible and are used to make pesto, are eaten raw in salads and sandwiches or are cooked to make soup. The small green bulbs are sometimes used as a substitute for capers. While Ramsons is popular with people as a wild food, it is said to be toxic if eaten by dogs.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:2078cb58-a6bb-4cd1-8561-f3f9ad773e11>"]}]}

He successfully crossed over to appeal to white audiences with his 1943 song 'Straighten Up and Fly Right' and further strengthened this connection with 'The Christmas Song' in 1946.\n","answer":"In the 1940s, Nat King Cole's musical career evolved significantly. He began his career as a jazz pianist and was part of the King Cole Trio, which was one of the first bands to be accepted in \"white\" jazz clubs. The trio gained popularity with instrumental jazz performances. However, Cole's career took a major turn when he started to incorporate vocals into his music.\n\nHis first mainstream vocal hit, \"Straighten Up and Fly Right,\" was recorded in 1943 and became a significant success.

The trio's popularity increased with hits like \"Get Your Kicks on Route 66\" and \"For Sentimental Reasons.\"\n\nIn the late 1940s, Cole began recording and performing more pop-oriented material, often accompanied by a string orchestra.

He continued to perform as a jazz pianist on sessions with other notable musicians and even recorded an all-jazz album, \"After Midnight,\" in 1956.\n\nOverall, the 1940s were a transformative period for Nat King Cole, as he evolved from a jazz pianist to a celebrated singer, bridging the gap between jazz and popular music.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context:\nNat King Cole is one of the world’s greatest jazz legends. The records he made in the 1940s have been of major influence on jazz\nmusic. His impact on generations of pianists\nwas not just far-reaching: it was fundamental. Nat is often regarded as the man who made it possible for black musicians to break through in the U.S. music scene. He did not refuse to perform before segregated audiences, for he believed that goodwill and exhibition of his talent were more effective than formal protests in fighting racism. His approach was not always a success: he was a victim of several racial incidents throughout his life. 1919 – 1936\nNathaniel Adams Coles was born on March 17 1919* in Montgomery, Alabama. He was born in a poor family: his father, Edward James Coles sr., was a reverend, his mother Perlina Adams Coles was the choir director of her husband’s church. Even though Nat’s parents had thirteen children, only five of them made it to adulthood. Nat grew up with his brother Edward jr. and his two sisters, Eddie Mae and Evelyn. When Nat was four years old his family moved to Chicago where his father had been offered pastorship of the True Light Baptist Church. In Chicago his parents got two more boys, Issac and Lionel (better known as “Freddie”.) Nat was taught to play the piano at an early age by his mother. Perlina, determined to give her children a musical education, succeeded. Her four sons all became professional musicians. When Nat was 12 years old he regularly sung and played the organ in church. After he joined Wendell Phillips High School he was introduced to jazz music and was greatly enthusiastic about this new type of music: together with his brother Eddie he would explore the Chicago jazz scene whenever he could. In 1934 Nat organized a jazz quintet called “Nat Coles and his Royal Dukes”, as well as a 14-piece orchestra called “Rogues of Rhythm”. When Nat heard Earl Hines play one night, he was heavily impressed and driven to give his quintet a new, more rhythmic sound, much like Hines’. Later he’d say about Hines: \"It was his driving force that appealed to me ... I was just a kid and coming up, but I latched onto that new Hines style. Guess I still show the influence today.\" (-Down Beat, 1957). When Nat was 16 he joined Eddie’s band “Solid Swingers” and started performing at jazz joints throughout Chicago. It was in these joints that Nat gained his first bit of success. The (mere) success didn’t do much good to Nat’s educational career: he dropped out of High School in 1936. 1936 - 1940\nNot long after he turned 18, Nat married Nadine Robinson. They had met each other on the vaudeville “Shuffle Along”. Nadine was one of the show’s dancers, while Nat was a pianist in the vaudeville-orchestra. When the show ended the couple settled in Los Angeles. They didn’t have much money and in order to pay the rent Nat had to play the piano in local beer joints for little pay. After a year of hard work Cole’s talent was discovered by the owner of the famous Century Club, at that time the most popular hangout in L.A. for jazz musicians – Nat became a regular performer at this club. Around 1938 Nat was asked to form a quintet (that eventually became a trio as drummer Lee Young didn’t show up on the opening night.) After bassist Wesley Prince and guitarist Oscar Moore joined, the group performed at the Sewanee Inn, an L.A. nightclub. Owner of the nightclub, Bob Lewis, asked from Nat that he would carry a golden crown made of paper - this is how Nat got his nickname “King”. Nat soon got rid of the crown, but the band kept its name: the “King Cole Trio”. 1940 - 1950\nIn their early days, the King Cole Trio played instrumental jazz. After 1940 they gradually introduced vocals to their music**. December 1940 they had the opportunity to record for the Decca record company. They recorded the hit song “Sweet Lorraine” and the groups’ popularity increased dramatically. The King Cole Trio was a bit of an oddity in their days. The music scene was dominated by Big Bands and black musicians were rejected from popular clubs, racism still being very common in the early 1940s.\n\nNat King Cole Biography, Life, Interesting Facts\nDied On :\nAlso Known For :\nBirth Place :\nChildhood And Early Life\nNat King Cole was born on March 17, 1917, in Montgomery, Alabama. He was the youngest son of Reverend Edwards Coles and Perlina Coles. At the age of four, Cole's family shifted base to North Chicago, Illinois where his father became the pastor of the church. Nat King Cole's first lessons in music were imparted by his mother, a church organist. She taught her son the art of playing the piano. Soon after, Cole started playing the organ and singing in the choir of his father's church. During his teenage years, Nat King Cole began taking formal lessons in music. He polished his music sense by learning different genres of music like jazz, gospel music, and Western Classical music. At the age of 15, Cole dropped out of school to pursue a full-time career in music. He started out as a jazz pianist. In the year, 1936, he took the byname Nat Cole and left Chicago to form his own jazz band 'Rogues of Rhythm.' His elder brother, Eddie, a bassist, joined forces with Cole's group and made their first professional recording. Nat King Cole and his brother were signed up to perform with the all-black Broadway musical revue 'Shuffle Along'. Though Eddie stayed back, Cole joined the troupe as a pianist on their national tour. After completing the tour, Cole started working on his music and subsequently, in 1937, he collaborated with guitarist Oscar Moore and bassist Wesley Prince to form the legendary music group 'The King Cole Trio.' The group members were masters in swing music and hence were also known as 'King Cole and His Swingsters.' The music group performed in local bars and toured extensively. In the late 1940's, the King Cole Trio signed a contract with Decca. Their very first achievement came in the year 1943 with the release of Cole's composition 'That ain't Right.' The song penned by Cole instantly struck the chord and became a chartbuster. In the same year, their contract with Decca came to an end. The trio reached the pinnacle of success when Nat King Cole started doubling as pianist and singer. The trio was soon signed up by Capitol Records. In the latter half of 1943, Nat King Cole and his Swingsters achieved commercial success with Cole's first vocal hit 'Straighten Up and Fly Right.' The song penned by Cole was inspired by the theme of his father's sermons. In the following years, the King Cole Trio reached the peaks of their career as they consecutively belted out chart hits like 'The Christmas Song,' 'For Sentimental Reasons,' 'Nature Boy' and many more. Though Nat King Cole had gained prominence as a jazz pianist, his soft baritone voice and sophisticated style of singing mesmerized his audiences prompting him to pursue a career as a solo artist. Cole emerged as the singing sensation of his time releasing track hits one after the other. Some of his best-known works are his signature song 'Unforgettable' (1951), the holiday hit 'The Christmas Song' (1946), 'Monalisa' (1950) and the number 1 song of 1951 'Too Young.' Throughout the 1950's, Cole continued to enjoy stardom and released several tracks that became chartbusters. \"Smile,\" \"Pretend,\" \"A Blossom Fell,\" and \"If I May\" are some of the well-known songs of that time. Nat King Cole was not just limited to music. He made several television appearances and had acted in short films and sitcoms. King Cole is the first African-American to host a national television variety show, 'The Nat King Cole Show.' Premiered on November 5, 1956, on NBC, the show began as a 15-minute pops show. But seeing the show's massive popularity, it was later expanded to cover a half an hour slot. Awards And Achievements\n- In 1963, Nat King Cole was awarded the prestigious Golden Globe Special Award. - In 1990, Cole was posthumously conferred with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. - He was inducted into Alabama Music Hall of Fame, Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame, Jazz Hall of Fame and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame. - His legacy stays on as a US postage stamp that was issued in 1994.\n\nWednesday, February 10, 2016\nNat King Cole (1919-1965) - Fly Right\nNat King Cole (1919-1965)\nStraighten Up and Fly Right (1943)\nNathaniel Adams Coles (March 17, 1919 - February 15, 1965), known professionally as Nat King Cole, was born in Montgomery, Alabama. His birth date, according to the World Almanac, was on Saint Patrick's Day in 1919; other sources have erroneously listed his birthdate as 1917. His father was a preacher in the Baptist church. His family moved to Chicago, Illinois, while he was still a child. There, his father became a minister; Nat's mother, Perlina, was the church organist. Nat learned to play the organ from his mother until the age of 12, when he began formal lessons. His first performance, at age four, was of Yes, We Have No Bananas. He learned not only jazz and gospel music, but European classical music as well, performing, as he said, \"from Johann Sebastian Bach to Sergei Rachmaninoff.\" So much for 20th-century music... The family lived in the Bronzeville neighborhood of Chicago. Nat would sneak out of the house and hang outside the clubs, listening to artists such as Louis Armstrong, Earl \"Fatha\" Hines, and Jimmie Noone. He participated in Walter Dyett's renowned music program at DuSable High School. Inspired by the playing of Earl Hines, Cole began his performing career in the mid 1930's while he was still a teenager, and adopted the name \"Nat Cole.\" His older brother, Eddie Coles, a bassist, soon joined Nat's band and they first recorded in 1936 under Eddie's name. They were also regular performers at clubs. In fact, Nat got his nickname \"King\" performing at one jazz club, a nickname presumably reinforced by the otherwise-unrelated nursery rhyme about Old King Cole. He was also a pianist in a national touring revival of ragtime and Broadway theatre legend, Eubie Blake's revue, \"Shuffle Along.\" When it suddenly failed in Long Beach, California, Cole decided to remain there. Nat Cole and three other musicians formed the \"King Cole Swingers\" in Long Beach and played in a number of local bars before getting a gig on the Long Beach Pike for US$90 per week. Nat married a dancer Megan Robinson, who was also with Shuffle Along, and moved to Los Angeles where he formed the Nat King Cole Trio. The trio consisted of Nat on piano, Oscar Moore on guitar, and Wesley Prince on double bass. The trio played in Los Angeles throughout the late 1930s and recorded many radio transcriptions. Nat's role was that of piano player and leader of the combo. It is a common misconception that Nat Cole's singing career did not start until a drunken barroom patron demanded that he sing \"Sweet Lorraine.\" In fact, Nat Cole has gone on record as saying that the fabricated story \"sounded good, so I just let it ride.\" In fact Nat Cole frequently sang in between instrumental numbers. Noticing that people started to request more vocal numbers, he obliged. Yet, the story of the insistent customer is not without merit. There was such a customer who did request a certain song one night, but a song that Nat did not know. Instead he sang \"Sweet Lorraine.\" The trio was tipped 15 cents for the performance, a nickel apiece (Nat King Cole: An Intimate Biography, Maria Cole with Louie Robinson, 1971). During World War II, Wesley Prince left the group and Cole replaced him with Johnny Miller. Miller would later be replaced by Charlie Harris in the 1950's. The King Cole Trio signed with the fledgling Capitol Records in 1943 and Cole stayed with the recording company for the rest of his career. Revenues from Cole's record sales fueled much of Capitol Records' success during this period, and are believed to have played a significant role in financing the distinctive Capitol Records building on Hollywood and Vine, in Los Angeles. Completed in 1956, it was the world's first circular office building and became known as \"the house that Nat built.\" Cole was considered a leading jazz pianist, appearing, for example, in the first Jazz at the Philharmonic concerts (credited on the Mercury Record labels as \"Shorty Nadine,\" apparently derived from the name of his wife at the time).\n\nHis revolutionary lineup of piano, guitar and bass in the time of the big bands became a popular set up for a jazz trio. It was emulated by many musicians, among them Art Tatum, Erroll Garner, Oscar Peterson, Ahmad Jamal, Tommy Flanagan and blues pianists Charles Brown and Ray Charles. He also performed as a pianist on sessions with Lester Young, Red Callender, and Lionel Hampton. The Page Cavanaugh Trio with the same set up as Cole came out of the chute about the same time, at the end of the war. Cole's first mainstream vocal hit was his 1943 recording of one of his compositions, \"Straighten Up and Fly Right,\" based on a black folk tale that his father had used as a theme for a sermon. Johnny Mercer invited him to record it for the fledgling Capitol Records label. It sold over 500,000 copies, and proved that folk-based material could appeal to a wide audience. Although Nat would never be considered a rocker, the song can be seen as anticipating the first rock and roll records. Indeed, Bo Diddley, who performed similar transformations of folk material, counted Cole as an influence. Beginning in the late 1940's, Cole began recording and performing more pop-oriented material for mainstream audiences, often accompanied by a string orchestra. His stature as a popular icon was cemented during this period by hits such as \"The Christmas Song\" (Cole recorded the tune four times: June 14, 1946 as a pure Trio recording; August 19, 1946 with an added string section; August 24, 1953; and again in 1961 for the double album, The Nat King Cole Story. This final version, recorded in stereo, is the one most often heard today. ), \"Nature Boy\" (1948), \"Mona Lisa\" (1950), \"Too Young\" (the #1 song in 1951), and his signature tune \"Unforgettable\" (1951). While this shift to pop music led some jazz critics and fans to accuse Cole of selling out, he never totally abandoned his jazz roots; as late as 1956, for instance, he recorded an all-jazz album, After Midnight. [Harold Arlen - It's Only a Paper Moon]\nThe change in musical tastes during the late 1950s meant that Cole's ballad singing did not sell well with younger listeners, despite a successful stab at rock n' roll with \"Send For Me\" (peaked at #6 pop). Along with his contemporaries Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett, Cole found that the pop singles chart had been almost entirely taken over by youth-oriented acts. In 1960, Nat's long-time collaborator Nelson Riddle left Capitol Records for Frank Sinatra's newly formed Reprise Records label. Riddle and Cole recorded one final hit album Wild Is Love, based on lyrics by Ray Rasch and Dotty Wayne. Cole later retooled the concept album into an off-Broadway show, I'm With You. Cole, a heavy smoker who would smoke as much as three packets of cigarettes a day, died of lung cancer on February 15, 1965, while still at the height of his singing career. The day before he died, he did a radio interview, stating: \"I am feeling better than ever. I think I've finally got this cancer licked.\" [8919 Courage \/ 8919 Nat King Cole \/ 8918 Bernstein]\n\nThe trio, however, was one of the first bands to be accepted to these “white” clubs. In 1941 the band went on a national tour. After touring for a few months they settled in New York where they performed at top jazz clubs. In 1942 Wesley Prince was drafted, he was replaced by Johnny Miller. With Miller the group moved back to Los Angeles where they did a series of performances at club “331”. One year later the trio was signed to Capitol Records. They recorded “Straighten Up and Fly Right”, which became a hit in 1944***. More hits the group made with Capitol in this period were “Get Your Kicks on Route 66\" and \"For Sentimental Reasons,\" amongst others. The late 1940s were a busy time for the trio. From 1946 till 1950 they filled the weekly radio program “Kraft Music Hall.” Together with pianist Eddy Duchin they gave young skillful artists the chance to reach a large audience. \"You have no idea how much satisfaction I got from the acceptance of the trio, because we opened the way for countless other small groups, units that before were strictly for cocktail lounges,\" Cole told Down Beat in 1957. In the same period the trio also played in a few movies, including “Breakfast in Hollywood”, “See my lawyer” and “The Stork Club.”\nIn 1946 Nat met the singer Maria Ellington (not related to The Duke, although she sang in his band for a short time) and fell in love with her. After divorcing Nadine he married Maria on March 28, 1948. Influenced by Maria, Nat radically moved away from jazz with the major hit “The Christmas Song” (December 1946.) “The Christmas Song” was the first song in which Nat sung rather than played the piano, with string section accompaniment. In 1947 Oscar Moore decided to leave the trio, Irving Ashby took his place. Nat more and more desired to become a mainstream artist rather than a jazz pianist. This was made clear in another major hit song: “Nature Boy” (1948.) 1950 - 1960\nNat’s first daughter, Natalie (nicknamed “Sweetie”) was born on February 6, 1950. A few months later Nat released the ballad “Mona Lisa” (that stayed on the charts for a record amount of weeks.) “Mona Lisa” permanently changed Nat’s career. The other members of the Cole King Trio had become Nat’s background music, this caused irritations and in 1955 the trio split up. Nat now gained great fame as a solo singer, many of his new fans didn’t even know he used to be a jazz pianist. During the 50’s he made success with \"Unforgettable,\" \"Too Young,\" \"Answer Me, My Love,\" and \"Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup.\" In 1956 Nat was asked to start an own TV show for NBC. This was quite an event: never before a major TV company had asked a Negro to host a show. The show was popular and got good ratings, but Nat never knew to find a sponsor. Businesses were afraid that white southern audiences would associate their products with a Negro. This caused the show to be cancelled after only one year of airtime. Nat did appear on the big screen another few times: in the movie “St. Louis Blues”(1958) for example, and in “The Nat King Cole Story”(1955), an autobiographic film. For a complete list of movies Nat appeared in, see the filmography below. Mid-fifties Nat and Maria adopted Maria’s sister’s daughter Carol, after both of Carol’s parents had died. In 1959 they adopted a boy whom they called Nat Kelly. Plagued by the popularity of Rock and Roll and upcoming artists like Johnny Mathis and Harry Belafonte, Nat’s career went a bit downhill in the late fifties. To prevent this he organized a touring concert show called “Sights and Sounds.” The show presented a group of young dancers and singers who called themselves the “Merry Young Souls.”\n1960 - 1965\nEven though Nat and Maria never thought they would get any more children of their own, in 1961 Maria got pregnant and gave birth to twins: Casey (named after baseball legend Casey Stengel) and Timolin. Nat’s career knew a revival in the early 1960s after he recorded the pop songs \"Ramblin' Rose\" and \"Those Lazy, Hazy, Crazy Days of Summer\" that both came on #1 in the American charts. Late 1964 Nat was diagnosed with lung cancer.\n\n- Search The Registry\n- Teacher’s Forum\n- Youth Programs\n- About Us\n- Creating Support\n- My Account\nNat King Cole\n*This date remembers Nat King Cole, born in 1919. He was a Black musician and singer. Nathaniel Adams Cole was born in Montgomery, Alabama, but grew up in Chicago. In 1937, after touring with a Black musical revue, he began playing in jazz clubs in Los Angeles. There he formed the King Cole Trio, with guitarist Oscar Moore and bassist Wesley Prince, in 1939. With his compact, syncopated backup chords and clean, spare, melodic phrases, Cole emphasized the piano as a solo, rather than a rhythm, instrument in his jazz arrangements. Commercial success came with his singing. After Straighten Up and Fly Right (1943), Cole gradually abandoned jazz piano for popular vocals. Among his other hits were Nature Boy, Mona Lisa, Too Young, and Unforgettable. After his marriage to Maria Hawkins Ellington, his daughter Natalie Maria Cole was born in Los Angeles, CA. Cole toured internationally and appeared in motion pictures. He first came to prominence as a jazz pianist but reached enormous popularity with his warm, relaxed, somewhat breathy-voiced ballad singing. He died February 15, 1965 in Santa Monica, California. ACSAP Biographical Dictionary\nR. R. Bowker Co., Copyright 1980\n\nAs both a singer and Jazz pianist of the highest caliber, Nat recorded literally thousands of songs, a staggering amount of which are well worth the listen. Over the years, there have been thousands of releases in a dazzling array of formats. If you are interested in or simply curious about Nat King Cole's music, this site is here as a handy reference! All Nat's recordings, best as I can figure it! You can find lists of tracks he recorded, as well as some information about when he recorded them, some commentary by yours truly and the original releases where applicable on albums and singles. A reference listing what information I may about the releases made during Nat's own lifetime. This section focuses on the reissues - Nat's recordings on CD and LP reissues. Tracks are listed, with some reviews, info and covers. Informal and unofficial discussions, comments about his recordings, and suggestions for finding the best of what's available now. Other topics of possible interest which may also be discussed include recording technology, the music business and other topics and performers contemporary with Nat. All this information is presented in a way which I hope will help you to make sense of it all. Some years back, about ooooh a generation ago, I was listening to a hits CD and liked one of the songs in particular. The CD notes said the track was by Nat King Cole and was from an album of his. I went online to learn more about the album and find out what else he might've recorded around that time. There were tons of \"hits\" on a search engine, a million places selling a million Nat King Cole compilations, but little useful info. As I came to enjoy more of his music, I looked further online and still didn't find much discussion about him. The situation hasn't improved all that much. So I've been trying to do something about that by making this site, which, by the way, is named after one of Nat's own instrumental compositions, A Pile 'O Cole. There are three formal discographies. Much of his recorded musical career is covered in the discographies included in the Mosaic Records and Bear Family Record box sets. The other option is in printed form from Roy Holmes. Either option is expensive and has a neccessarily limited context. Therefore, I set sights on attempting to make an informal discography online. It would be just little ole me doing it, with zero budget, very little spare time, no access to archives or Roy Holmes' work, and a partial (but not bad) collection of Nat's records. It won't ever be complete or accurate, but it can help some folks trying to make sense of the masses of issues and find the recordings they want as well as spread appreciation for Nat and his music. I'm slowly working on it in odd moments. If you can help, email me. Corrections, tips and donations ;) are gratefully welcomed. Likewise if you need information, inquiries are welcome. Please note that replies may take some time. I should clarify, as well, that I do not sell CDs nor provide any music in any form; and I am not in any way affiliated with the Nat King Cole estate nor Capitol \/ EMI. Opinions expressed are my own unless specifically noted and do not represent the views of Capitol \/ EMI nor the Nat King Cole estate. Nat King Cole's music is one of the pleasures of this world which we all can enjoy throughout our lives. His innate gentility, artistry and dignity is also an inspiration. If this site helps anyone to gain better awareness of his recordings and helps with access to them, then it's been worth all the work. - Still trying to straighten up and fly right, A Pile o' Cole\n\nFrank Sinatra transformed popular music. Often cited as the single finest interpreter of American standards, he influenced generations of vocalists such as Nat King Cole and Carmen McRae by focusing on phrasing and matching narrative nuance and emotional naturalism with amazing breathing control. In the 1930s, Sinatra starting bringing back \"old\" songs by such masters as Cole Porter while he was still a Big Band singer. He became a national institution in the '40s, and even though Ray Charles has praised the flawless technique of this Columbia period, Sinatra kept evolving. Starting in the '50s he concentrated on groundbreaking concept albums and a fresh Big Band sound with master arranger Nelson Riddle. Sinatra explored every nuance of emotion on these Capitol and Reprise albums and influenced the work of Ella Fitzgerald and Peggy Lee. Beginning in the '70s, when rock ruled, his voice and output became erratic but some brilliant work remains. Though Sinatra always viewed himself as a popular singer, jazz musicians hold his work in the highest esteem. Miles Davis and Lester Young often interpreted standards through his versions and avant-gardist John Zorn has said that in his own way, Frank Sinatra was as much a jazz improviser as Charlie Parker.\n\nYour assignment is to listen to five famous holiday songs. These are mostly songs and singers that, in their time, became a significant part of American culture. In large part, the song and singer became famous because of each other, and so these versions became famous--not just the song, and not just the singer. I want you to think about what makes a song and singer go beyond being famous to the point it becomes part of the larger culture. If you are uncomfortable with this assignment, please let me know and I will give you an alternative assignment to complete. I have posted these songs on a private page on my personal website because I can embed them directly. On CompassNet I can only make them so you can download them and I think this will be easier for you. 1. Choose FIVE songs from the list below. Don’t just choose the first five. Look around a little and find some that look fun or at least interesting. Listen to the songs. 2. After you decide which song you like best, answer the two questions I asked (there are two questions below each song). You only need to answer the questions for the song you liked most. You will need to Google and think a little to answer these questions, but the answers are available. 3. Pick the song you personally liked least. I want you to explain why it might have become popular. Why might other people have liked it? 4. Once you have done the required five songs, you may do more for extra credit. There are two options for extra credit. One: you can answer the two questions for more of the songs you listened to. OR, there is an extra credit section below. Follow the directions. I will give you two points of extra credit for every additional two questions you answer, or each of the compare\/contrast options you complete. The maximum you may earn in extra credit is ten points. This assignment is due by January 6, 2016. Five songs should not be hard if you start right away and do a little each day. If you wait until the end, it will be hard. So please don't procrastinate. I estimate each song will take you about 10 minutes to listen and then answer the questions. Have fun! I can think of far worse homework assignments. \"Believe\" Josh Groban\nThis song is not yet a classic. It came from a movie that didn't do all that well. But, every year I feel like I hear it more and more. I think it might be becoming a classic. Listen to the music and think of the way it makes you feel.

What is that group?\n\n1940s in jazz\nIn the early 1940s in jazz, bebop emerged, led by Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk and others. It helped to shift jazz from danceable popular music towards a more challenging \"musician's music.\" Differing greatly from swing, early bebop divorced itself from dance music, establishing itself more as an art form but lessening its potential popular and commercial value. Since bebop was meant to be listened to, not danced to, it used faster tempos. Beboppers introduced new forms of chromaticism and dissonance into jazz; the dissonant tritone (or \"flatted fifth\") interval became the \"most important interval of bebop\" and players engaged in a more abstracted form of chord-based improvisation which used \"passing\" chords, substitute chords, and altered chords. The style of drumming shifted as well to a more elusive and explosive style, in which the ride cymbal was used to keep time, while the snare and bass drum were used for accents. This appealed to a more specialized audiences than earlier forms of jazz, with sophisticated harmonies, fast tempos and often virtuoso musicianship. Bebop musicians often used 1930s standards, especially those from Broadway musicals, as part of their repertoire. Among standards written by bebop musicians are Gillespie's \"Salt Peanuts\" (1941) and \"A Night in Tunisia\" (1942), Parker's \"Anthropology\" (1946), \"Yardbird Suite\" (1946) and \"Scrapple from the Apple\" (1947), and Monk's \"'Round Midnight\" (1944), which is currently the most recorded jazz standard composed by a jazz musician. An early 1940s style known as \"jumping the blues\" or jump blues used small combos, uptempo music, and blues chord progressions. Jump blues drew on boogie-woogie from the 1930s. Kansas City Jazz in the 1930s as exemplified by tenor saxophonist Lester Young marked the transition from big bands to the bebop influence of the 1940s. These divergences from the jazz mainstream of the time initially met with a divided, sometimes hostile response among fans and fellow musicians, especially established swing players, who bristled at the new harmonic sounds. To hostile critics, bebop seemed to be filled with \"racing, nervous phrases\". Despite the initial friction, by the 1950s bebop had become an accepted part of the jazz vocabulary. The most influential bebop musicians included saxophonist Charlie Parker, pianists Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk, trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie and Clifford Brown, and drummer Max Roach. The swing era lasted until the mid-1940s, and produced popular tunes such as Duke Ellington's \"Cotton Tail\" (1940) and Billy Strayhorn's \"Take the 'A' Train\" (1941). When the big bands struggled to keep going during World War II, a shift was happening in jazz in favor of smaller groups. Some swing era musicians, like Louis Jordan, later found popularity in a new kind of music, called \"rhythm and blues\", that would evolve into rock and roll in the 1950s. In the late 1940s there was a revival of \"Dixieland\" music, harkening back to the original contrapuntal New Orleans style. This was driven in large part by record company reissues of early jazz classics by the Oliver, Morton, and Armstrong bands of the 1930s. There were two populations of musicians involved in the revival. One group consisted of players who had begun their careers playing in the traditional style, and were either returning to it, or continuing what they had been playing all along, such as Bob Crosby's Bobcats, Max Kaminsky, Eddie Condon, and Wild Bill Davison. Most of this group were originally Midwesterners, although there were a small number of New Orleans musicians involved. The second population of revivalists consisted of young musicians such as the Lu Watters band. By the late 1940s, Louis Armstrong's Allstars band became a leading ensemble. Through the 1950s and 1960s, Dixieland was one of the most commercially popular jazz styles in the US, Europe, and Japan, although critics paid little attention to it.","passages":[{"passage":"Nat King Cole is one of the world’s greatest jazz legends. The records he made in the 1940s have been of major influence on jazz\nmusic. His impact on generations of pianists\nwas not just far-reaching: it was fundamental. Nat is often regarded as the man who made it possible for black musicians to break through in the U.S. music scene. He did not refuse to perform before segregated audiences, for he believed that goodwill and exhibition of his talent were more effective than formal protests in fighting racism. His approach was not always a success: he was a victim of several racial incidents throughout his life. 1919 – 1936\nNathaniel Adams Coles was born on March 17 1919* in Montgomery, Alabama. He was born in a poor family: his father, Edward James Coles sr., was a reverend, his mother Perlina Adams Coles was the choir director of her husband’s church. Even though Nat’s parents had thirteen children, only five of them made it to adulthood. Nat grew up with his brother Edward jr. and his two sisters, Eddie Mae and Evelyn. When Nat was four years old his family moved to Chicago where his father had been offered pastorship of the True Light Baptist Church. In Chicago his parents got two more boys, Issac and Lionel (better known as “Freddie”.) Nat was taught to play the piano at an early age by his mother. Perlina, determined to give her children a musical education, succeeded. Her four sons all became professional musicians. When Nat was 12 years old he regularly sung and played the organ in church. After he joined Wendell Phillips High School he was introduced to jazz music and was greatly enthusiastic about this new type of music: together with his brother Eddie he would explore the Chicago jazz scene whenever he could. In 1934 Nat organized a jazz quintet called “Nat Coles and his Royal Dukes”, as well as a 14-piece orchestra called “Rogues of Rhythm”. When Nat heard Earl Hines play one night, he was heavily impressed and driven to give his quintet a new, more rhythmic sound, much like Hines’. Later he’d say about Hines: \"It was his driving force that appealed to me ... I was just a kid and coming up, but I latched onto that new Hines style. Guess I still show the influence today.\" (-Down Beat, 1957). When Nat was 16 he joined Eddie’s band “Solid Swingers” and started performing at jazz joints throughout Chicago. It was in these joints that Nat gained his first bit of success. The (mere) success didn’t do much good to Nat’s educational career: he dropped out of High School in 1936. 1936 - 1940\nNot long after he turned 18, Nat married Nadine Robinson. They had met each other on the vaudeville “Shuffle Along”. Nadine was one of the show’s dancers, while Nat was a pianist in the vaudeville-orchestra. When the show ended the couple settled in Los Angeles. They didn’t have much money and in order to pay the rent Nat had to play the piano in local beer joints for little pay. After a year of hard work Cole’s talent was discovered by the owner of the famous Century Club, at that time the most popular hangout in L.A. for jazz musicians – Nat became a regular performer at this club. Around 1938 Nat was asked to form a quintet (that eventually became a trio as drummer Lee Young didn’t show up on the opening night.) After bassist Wesley Prince and guitarist Oscar Moore joined, the group performed at the Sewanee Inn, an L.A. nightclub. Owner of the nightclub, Bob Lewis, asked from Nat that he would carry a golden crown made of paper - this is how Nat got his nickname “King”. Nat soon got rid of the crown, but the band kept its name: the “King Cole Trio”. 1940 - 1950\nIn their early days, the King Cole Trio played instrumental jazz. After 1940 they gradually introduced vocals to their music**. December 1940 they had the opportunity to record for the Decca record company. They recorded the hit song “Sweet Lorraine” and the groups’ popularity increased dramatically. The King Cole Trio was a bit of an oddity in their days. The music scene was dominated by Big Bands and black musicians were rejected from popular clubs, racism still being very common in the early 1940s.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:2cb15f4a-7e7d-49a0-b6d8-bb71f013417f>"]},{"passage":"Nat King Cole Biography, Life, Interesting Facts\nDied On :\nAlso Known For :\nBirth Place :\nChildhood And Early Life\nNat King Cole was born on March 17, 1917, in Montgomery, Alabama. He was the youngest son of Reverend Edwards Coles and Perlina Coles. At the age of four, Cole's family shifted base to North Chicago, Illinois where his father became the pastor of the church. Nat King Cole's first lessons in music were imparted by his mother, a church organist. She taught her son the art of playing the piano. Soon after, Cole started playing the organ and singing in the choir of his father's church. During his teenage years, Nat King Cole began taking formal lessons in music. He polished his music sense by learning different genres of music like jazz, gospel music, and Western Classical music. At the age of 15, Cole dropped out of school to pursue a full-time career in music. He started out as a jazz pianist. In the year, 1936, he took the byname Nat Cole and left Chicago to form his own jazz band 'Rogues of Rhythm.' His elder brother, Eddie, a bassist, joined forces with Cole's group and made their first professional recording. Nat King Cole and his brother were signed up to perform with the all-black Broadway musical revue 'Shuffle Along'. Though Eddie stayed back, Cole joined the troupe as a pianist on their national tour. After completing the tour, Cole started working on his music and subsequently, in 1937, he collaborated with guitarist Oscar Moore and bassist Wesley Prince to form the legendary music group 'The King Cole Trio.' The group members were masters in swing music and hence were also known as 'King Cole and His Swingsters.' The music group performed in local bars and toured extensively. In the late 1940's, the King Cole Trio signed a contract with Decca. Their very first achievement came in the year 1943 with the release of Cole's composition 'That ain't Right.' The song penned by Cole instantly struck the chord and became a chartbuster. In the same year, their contract with Decca came to an end. The trio reached the pinnacle of success when Nat King Cole started doubling as pianist and singer. The trio was soon signed up by Capitol Records. In the latter half of 1943, Nat King Cole and his Swingsters achieved commercial success with Cole's first vocal hit 'Straighten Up and Fly Right.' The song penned by Cole was inspired by the theme of his father's sermons. In the following years, the King Cole Trio reached the peaks of their career as they consecutively belted out chart hits like 'The Christmas Song,' 'For Sentimental Reasons,' 'Nature Boy' and many more. Though Nat King Cole had gained prominence as a jazz pianist, his soft baritone voice and sophisticated style of singing mesmerized his audiences prompting him to pursue a career as a solo artist. Cole emerged as the singing sensation of his time releasing track hits one after the other. Some of his best-known works are his signature song 'Unforgettable' (1951), the holiday hit 'The Christmas Song' (1946), 'Monalisa' (1950) and the number 1 song of 1951 'Too Young.' Throughout the 1950's, Cole continued to enjoy stardom and released several tracks that became chartbusters. \"Smile,\" \"Pretend,\" \"A Blossom Fell,\" and \"If I May\" are some of the well-known songs of that time. Nat King Cole was not just limited to music. He made several television appearances and had acted in short films and sitcoms. King Cole is the first African-American to host a national television variety show, 'The Nat King Cole Show.' Premiered on November 5, 1956, on NBC, the show began as a 15-minute pops show. But seeing the show's massive popularity, it was later expanded to cover a half an hour slot. Awards And Achievements\n- In 1963, Nat King Cole was awarded the prestigious Golden Globe Special Award. - In 1990, Cole was posthumously conferred with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. - He was inducted into Alabama Music Hall of Fame, Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame, Jazz Hall of Fame and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame. - His legacy stays on as a US postage stamp that was issued in 1994.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:473a4df3-124c-41ac-945d-6642250f6fc0>"]},{"passage":"Wednesday, February 10, 2016\nNat King Cole (1919-1965) - Fly Right\nNat King Cole (1919-1965)\nStraighten Up and Fly Right (1943)\nNathaniel Adams Coles (March 17, 1919 - February 15, 1965), known professionally as Nat King Cole, was born in Montgomery, Alabama. His birth date, according to the World Almanac, was on Saint Patrick's Day in 1919; other sources have erroneously listed his birthdate as 1917. His father was a preacher in the Baptist church. His family moved to Chicago, Illinois, while he was still a child. There, his father became a minister; Nat's mother, Perlina, was the church organist. Nat learned to play the organ from his mother until the age of 12, when he began formal lessons. His first performance, at age four, was of Yes, We Have No Bananas. He learned not only jazz and gospel music, but European classical music as well, performing, as he said, \"from Johann Sebastian Bach to Sergei Rachmaninoff.\" So much for 20th-century music... The family lived in the Bronzeville neighborhood of Chicago. Nat would sneak out of the house and hang outside the clubs, listening to artists such as Louis Armstrong, Earl \"Fatha\" Hines, and Jimmie Noone. He participated in Walter Dyett's renowned music program at DuSable High School. Inspired by the playing of Earl Hines, Cole began his performing career in the mid 1930's while he was still a teenager, and adopted the name \"Nat Cole.\" His older brother, Eddie Coles, a bassist, soon joined Nat's band and they first recorded in 1936 under Eddie's name. They were also regular performers at clubs. In fact, Nat got his nickname \"King\" performing at one jazz club, a nickname presumably reinforced by the otherwise-unrelated nursery rhyme about Old King Cole. He was also a pianist in a national touring revival of ragtime and Broadway theatre legend, Eubie Blake's revue, \"Shuffle Along.\" When it suddenly failed in Long Beach, California, Cole decided to remain there. Nat Cole and three other musicians formed the \"King Cole Swingers\" in Long Beach and played in a number of local bars before getting a gig on the Long Beach Pike for US$90 per week. Nat married a dancer Megan Robinson, who was also with Shuffle Along, and moved to Los Angeles where he formed the Nat King Cole Trio. The trio consisted of Nat on piano, Oscar Moore on guitar, and Wesley Prince on double bass. The trio played in Los Angeles throughout the late 1930s and recorded many radio transcriptions. Nat's role was that of piano player and leader of the combo. It is a common misconception that Nat Cole's singing career did not start until a drunken barroom patron demanded that he sing \"Sweet Lorraine.\" In fact, Nat Cole has gone on record as saying that the fabricated story \"sounded good, so I just let it ride.\" In fact Nat Cole frequently sang in between instrumental numbers. Noticing that people started to request more vocal numbers, he obliged. Yet, the story of the insistent customer is not without merit. There was such a customer who did request a certain song one night, but a song that Nat did not know. Instead he sang \"Sweet Lorraine.\" The trio was tipped 15 cents for the performance, a nickel apiece (Nat King Cole: An Intimate Biography, Maria Cole with Louie Robinson, 1971). During World War II, Wesley Prince left the group and Cole replaced him with Johnny Miller. Miller would later be replaced by Charlie Harris in the 1950's. The King Cole Trio signed with the fledgling Capitol Records in 1943 and Cole stayed with the recording company for the rest of his career. Revenues from Cole's record sales fueled much of Capitol Records' success during this period, and are believed to have played a significant role in financing the distinctive Capitol Records building on Hollywood and Vine, in Los Angeles. Completed in 1956, it was the world's first circular office building and became known as \"the house that Nat built.\" Cole was considered a leading jazz pianist, appearing, for example, in the first Jazz at the Philharmonic concerts (credited on the Mercury Record labels as \"Shorty Nadine,\" apparently derived from the name of his wife at the time).","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:39a7065b-7e6d-4363-aedb-f6b019d59ff0>"]},{"passage":"His revolutionary lineup of piano, guitar and bass in the time of the big bands became a popular set up for a jazz trio. It was emulated by many musicians, among them Art Tatum, Erroll Garner, Oscar Peterson, Ahmad Jamal, Tommy Flanagan and blues pianists Charles Brown and Ray Charles. He also performed as a pianist on sessions with Lester Young, Red Callender, and Lionel Hampton. The Page Cavanaugh Trio with the same set up as Cole came out of the chute about the same time, at the end of the war. Cole's first mainstream vocal hit was his 1943 recording of one of his compositions, \"Straighten Up and Fly Right,\" based on a black folk tale that his father had used as a theme for a sermon. Johnny Mercer invited him to record it for the fledgling Capitol Records label. It sold over 500,000 copies, and proved that folk-based material could appeal to a wide audience. Although Nat would never be considered a rocker, the song can be seen as anticipating the first rock and roll records. Indeed, Bo Diddley, who performed similar transformations of folk material, counted Cole as an influence. Beginning in the late 1940's, Cole began recording and performing more pop-oriented material for mainstream audiences, often accompanied by a string orchestra. His stature as a popular icon was cemented during this period by hits such as \"The Christmas Song\" (Cole recorded the tune four times: June 14, 1946 as a pure Trio recording; August 19, 1946 with an added string section; August 24, 1953; and again in 1961 for the double album, The Nat King Cole Story. This final version, recorded in stereo, is the one most often heard today. ), \"Nature Boy\" (1948), \"Mona Lisa\" (1950), \"Too Young\" (the #1 song in 1951), and his signature tune \"Unforgettable\" (1951). While this shift to pop music led some jazz critics and fans to accuse Cole of selling out, he never totally abandoned his jazz roots; as late as 1956, for instance, he recorded an all-jazz album, After Midnight. [Harold Arlen - It's Only a Paper Moon]\nThe change in musical tastes during the late 1950s meant that Cole's ballad singing did not sell well with younger listeners, despite a successful stab at rock n' roll with \"Send For Me\" (peaked at #6 pop). Along with his contemporaries Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett, Cole found that the pop singles chart had been almost entirely taken over by youth-oriented acts. In 1960, Nat's long-time collaborator Nelson Riddle left Capitol Records for Frank Sinatra's newly formed Reprise Records label. Riddle and Cole recorded one final hit album Wild Is Love, based on lyrics by Ray Rasch and Dotty Wayne. Cole later retooled the concept album into an off-Broadway show, I'm With You. Cole, a heavy smoker who would smoke as much as three packets of cigarettes a day, died of lung cancer on February 15, 1965, while still at the height of his singing career. The day before he died, he did a radio interview, stating: \"I am feeling better than ever. I think I've finally got this cancer licked.\" [8919 Courage \/ 8919 Nat King Cole \/ 8918 Bernstein]","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:39a7065b-7e6d-4363-aedb-f6b019d59ff0>"]},{"passage":"The trio, however, was one of the first bands to be accepted to these “white” clubs. In 1941 the band went on a national tour. After touring for a few months they settled in New York where they performed at top jazz clubs. In 1942 Wesley Prince was drafted, he was replaced by Johnny Miller. With Miller the group moved back to Los Angeles where they did a series of performances at club “331”. One year later the trio was signed to Capitol Records. They recorded “Straighten Up and Fly Right”, which became a hit in 1944***. More hits the group made with Capitol in this period were “Get Your Kicks on Route 66\" and \"For Sentimental Reasons,\" amongst others. The late 1940s were a busy time for the trio. From 1946 till 1950 they filled the weekly radio program “Kraft Music Hall.” Together with pianist Eddy Duchin they gave young skillful artists the chance to reach a large audience. \"You have no idea how much satisfaction I got from the acceptance of the trio, because we opened the way for countless other small groups, units that before were strictly for cocktail lounges,\" Cole told Down Beat in 1957. In the same period the trio also played in a few movies, including “Breakfast in Hollywood”, “See my lawyer” and “The Stork Club.”\nIn 1946 Nat met the singer Maria Ellington (not related to The Duke, although she sang in his band for a short time) and fell in love with her. After divorcing Nadine he married Maria on March 28, 1948. Influenced by Maria, Nat radically moved away from jazz with the major hit “The Christmas Song” (December 1946.) “The Christmas Song” was the first song in which Nat sung rather than played the piano, with string section accompaniment. In 1947 Oscar Moore decided to leave the trio, Irving Ashby took his place. Nat more and more desired to become a mainstream artist rather than a jazz pianist. This was made clear in another major hit song: “Nature Boy” (1948.) 1950 - 1960\nNat’s first daughter, Natalie (nicknamed “Sweetie”) was born on February 6, 1950. A few months later Nat released the ballad “Mona Lisa” (that stayed on the charts for a record amount of weeks.) “Mona Lisa” permanently changed Nat’s career. The other members of the Cole King Trio had become Nat’s background music, this caused irritations and in 1955 the trio split up. Nat now gained great fame as a solo singer, many of his new fans didn’t even know he used to be a jazz pianist. During the 50’s he made success with \"Unforgettable,\" \"Too Young,\" \"Answer Me, My Love,\" and \"Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup.\" In 1956 Nat was asked to start an own TV show for NBC. This was quite an event: never before a major TV company had asked a Negro to host a show. The show was popular and got good ratings, but Nat never knew to find a sponsor. Businesses were afraid that white southern audiences would associate their products with a Negro. This caused the show to be cancelled after only one year of airtime. Nat did appear on the big screen another few times: in the movie “St. Louis Blues”(1958) for example, and in “The Nat King Cole Story”(1955), an autobiographic film. For a complete list of movies Nat appeared in, see the filmography below. Mid-fifties Nat and Maria adopted Maria’s sister’s daughter Carol, after both of Carol’s parents had died. In 1959 they adopted a boy whom they called Nat Kelly. Plagued by the popularity of Rock and Roll and upcoming artists like Johnny Mathis and Harry Belafonte, Nat’s career went a bit downhill in the late fifties. To prevent this he organized a touring concert show called “Sights and Sounds.” The show presented a group of young dancers and singers who called themselves the “Merry Young Souls.”\n1960 - 1965\nEven though Nat and Maria never thought they would get any more children of their own, in 1961 Maria got pregnant and gave birth to twins: Casey (named after baseball legend Casey Stengel) and Timolin. Nat’s career knew a revival in the early 1960s after he recorded the pop songs \"Ramblin' Rose\" and \"Those Lazy, Hazy, Crazy Days of Summer\" that both came on #1 in the American charts. Late 1964 Nat was diagnosed with lung cancer.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:2cb15f4a-7e7d-49a0-b6d8-bb71f013417f>"]},{"passage":"- Search The Registry\n- Teacher’s Forum\n- Youth Programs\n- About Us\n- Creating Support\n- My Account\nNat King Cole\n*This date remembers Nat King Cole, born in 1919. He was a Black musician and singer. Nathaniel Adams Cole was born in Montgomery, Alabama, but grew up in Chicago. In 1937, after touring with a Black musical revue, he began playing in jazz clubs in Los Angeles. There he formed the King Cole Trio, with guitarist Oscar Moore and bassist Wesley Prince, in 1939. With his compact, syncopated backup chords and clean, spare, melodic phrases, Cole emphasized the piano as a solo, rather than a rhythm, instrument in his jazz arrangements. Commercial success came with his singing. After Straighten Up and Fly Right (1943), Cole gradually abandoned jazz piano for popular vocals. Among his other hits were Nature Boy, Mona Lisa, Too Young, and Unforgettable. After his marriage to Maria Hawkins Ellington, his daughter Natalie Maria Cole was born in Los Angeles, CA. Cole toured internationally and appeared in motion pictures. He first came to prominence as a jazz pianist but reached enormous popularity with his warm, relaxed, somewhat breathy-voiced ballad singing. He died February 15, 1965 in Santa Monica, California.

Over the years, there have been thousands of releases in a dazzling array of formats. If you are interested in or simply curious about Nat King Cole's music, this site is here as a handy reference! All Nat's recordings, best as I can figure it! You can find lists of tracks he recorded, as well as some information about when he recorded them, some commentary by yours truly and the original releases where applicable on albums and singles. A reference listing what information I may about the releases made during Nat's own lifetime. This section focuses on the reissues - Nat's recordings on CD and LP reissues. Tracks are listed, with some reviews, info and covers. Informal and unofficial discussions, comments about his recordings, and suggestions for finding the best of what's available now. Other topics of possible interest which may also be discussed include recording technology, the music business and other topics and performers contemporary with Nat. All this information is presented in a way which I hope will help you to make sense of it all. Some years back, about ooooh a generation ago, I was listening to a hits CD and liked one of the songs in particular. The CD notes said the track was by Nat King Cole and was from an album of his. I went online to learn more about the album and find out what else he might've recorded around that time. There were tons of \"hits\" on a search engine, a million places selling a million Nat King Cole compilations, but little useful info. As I came to enjoy more of his music, I looked further online and still didn't find much discussion about him. The situation hasn't improved all that much. So I've been trying to do something about that by making this site, which, by the way, is named after one of Nat's own instrumental compositions, A Pile 'O Cole. There are three formal discographies. Much of his recorded musical career is covered in the discographies included in the Mosaic Records and Bear Family Record box sets. The other option is in printed form from Roy Holmes. Either option is expensive and has a neccessarily limited context. Therefore, I set sights on attempting to make an informal discography online. It would be just little ole me doing it, with zero budget, very little spare time, no access to archives or Roy Holmes' work, and a partial (but not bad) collection of Nat's records. It won't ever be complete or accurate, but it can help some folks trying to make sense of the masses of issues and find the recordings they want as well as spread appreciation for Nat and his music. I'm slowly working on it in odd moments. If you can help, email me. Corrections, tips and donations ;) are gratefully welcomed. Likewise if you need information, inquiries are welcome. Please note that replies may take some time. I should clarify, as well, that I do not sell CDs nor provide any music in any form; and I am not in any way affiliated with the Nat King Cole estate nor Capitol \/ EMI. Opinions expressed are my own unless specifically noted and do not represent the views of Capitol \/ EMI nor the Nat King Cole estate. Nat King Cole's music is one of the pleasures of this world which we all can enjoy throughout our lives. His innate gentility, artistry and dignity is also an inspiration. If this site helps anyone to gain better awareness of his recordings and helps with access to them, then it's been worth all the work. - Still trying to straighten up and fly right, A Pile o' Cole","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:a7d90d7a-e28b-42cb-bb62-f2909c66dde1>"]},{"passage":"Frank Sinatra transformed popular music. Often cited as the single finest interpreter of American standards, he influenced generations of vocalists such as Nat King Cole and Carmen McRae by focusing on phrasing and matching narrative nuance and emotional naturalism with amazing breathing control. In the 1930s, Sinatra starting bringing back \"old\" songs by such masters as Cole Porter while he was still a Big Band singer. He became a national institution in the '40s, and even though Ray Charles has praised the flawless technique of this Columbia period, Sinatra kept evolving. Starting in the '50s he concentrated on groundbreaking concept albums and a fresh Big Band sound with master arranger Nelson Riddle. Sinatra explored every nuance of emotion on these Capitol and Reprise albums and influenced the work of Ella Fitzgerald and Peggy Lee. Beginning in the '70s, when rock ruled, his voice and output became erratic but some brilliant work remains. Though Sinatra always viewed himself as a popular singer, jazz musicians hold his work in the highest esteem. Miles Davis and Lester Young often interpreted standards through his versions and avant-gardist John Zorn has said that in his own way, Frank Sinatra was as much a jazz improviser as Charlie Parker.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:5e43fe16-7b97-4355-96c0-ec2306310b8b>"]},{"passage":"Your assignment is to listen to five famous holiday songs. These are mostly songs and singers that, in their time, became a significant part of American culture. In large part, the song and singer became famous because of each other, and so these versions became famous--not just the song, and not just the singer. I want you to think about what makes a song and singer go beyond being famous to the point it becomes part of the larger culture. If you are uncomfortable with this assignment, please let me know and I will give you an alternative assignment to complete. I have posted these songs on a private page on my personal website because I can embed them directly. On CompassNet I can only make them so you can download them and I think this will be easier for you. 1. Choose FIVE songs from the list below. Don’t just choose the first five. Look around a little and find some that look fun or at least interesting. Listen to the songs. 2. After you decide which song you like best, answer the two questions I asked (there are two questions below each song). You only need to answer the questions for the song you liked most. You will need to Google and think a little to answer these questions, but the answers are available. 3. Pick the song you personally liked least. I want you to explain why it might have become popular. Why might other people have liked it? 4. Once you have done the required five songs, you may do more for extra credit. There are two options for extra credit. One: you can answer the two questions for more of the songs you listened to. OR, there is an extra credit section below. Follow the directions. I will give you two points of extra credit for every additional two questions you answer, or each of the compare\/contrast options you complete. The maximum you may earn in extra credit is ten points. This assignment is due by January 6, 2016. Five songs should not be hard if you start right away and do a little each day. If you wait until the end, it will be hard. So please don't procrastinate. I estimate each song will take you about 10 minutes to listen and then answer the questions. Have fun!

It helped to shift jazz from danceable popular music towards a more challenging \"musician's music.\" Differing greatly from swing, early bebop divorced itself from dance music, establishing itself more as an art form but lessening its potential popular and commercial value. Since bebop was meant to be listened to, not danced to, it used faster tempos. Beboppers introduced new forms of chromaticism and dissonance into jazz; the dissonant tritone (or \"flatted fifth\") interval became the \"most important interval of bebop\" and players engaged in a more abstracted form of chord-based improvisation which used \"passing\" chords, substitute chords, and altered chords. The style of drumming shifted as well to a more elusive and explosive style, in which the ride cymbal was used to keep time, while the snare and bass drum were used for accents. This appealed to a more specialized audiences than earlier forms of jazz, with sophisticated harmonies, fast tempos and often virtuoso musicianship. Bebop musicians often used 1930s standards, especially those from Broadway musicals, as part of their repertoire. Among standards written by bebop musicians are Gillespie's \"Salt Peanuts\" (1941) and \"A Night in Tunisia\" (1942), Parker's \"Anthropology\" (1946), \"Yardbird Suite\" (1946) and \"Scrapple from the Apple\" (1947), and Monk's \"'Round Midnight\" (1944), which is currently the most recorded jazz standard composed by a jazz musician. An early 1940s style known as \"jumping the blues\" or jump blues used small combos, uptempo music, and blues chord progressions. Jump blues drew on boogie-woogie from the 1930s. Kansas City Jazz in the 1930s as exemplified by tenor saxophonist Lester Young marked the transition from big bands to the bebop influence of the 1940s. These divergences from the jazz mainstream of the time initially met with a divided, sometimes hostile response among fans and fellow musicians, especially established swing players, who bristled at the new harmonic sounds. To hostile critics, bebop seemed to be filled with \"racing, nervous phrases\". Despite the initial friction, by the 1950s bebop had become an accepted part of the jazz vocabulary. The most influential bebop musicians included saxophonist Charlie Parker, pianists Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk, trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie and Clifford Brown, and drummer Max Roach. The swing era lasted until the mid-1940s, and produced popular tunes such as Duke Ellington's \"Cotton Tail\" (1940) and Billy Strayhorn's \"Take the 'A' Train\" (1941). When the big bands struggled to keep going during World War II, a shift was happening in jazz in favor of smaller groups. Some swing era musicians, like Louis Jordan, later found popularity in a new kind of music, called \"rhythm and blues\", that would evolve into rock and roll in the 1950s. In the late 1940s there was a revival of \"Dixieland\" music, harkening back to the original contrapuntal New Orleans style. This was driven in large part by record company reissues of early jazz classics by the Oliver, Morton, and Armstrong bands of the 1930s. There were two populations of musicians involved in the revival. One group consisted of players who had begun their careers playing in the traditional style, and were either returning to it, or continuing what they had been playing all along, such as Bob Crosby's Bobcats, Max Kaminsky, Eddie Condon, and Wild Bill Davison. Most of this group were originally Midwesterners, although there were a small number of New Orleans musicians involved. The second population of revivalists consisted of young musicians such as the Lu Watters band. By the late 1940s, Louis Armstrong's Allstars band became a leading ensemble. Through the 1950s and 1960s, Dixieland was one of the most commercially popular jazz styles in the US, Europe, and Japan, although critics paid little attention to it.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:f7ffb6af-5c48-4ad8-902e-4329f2a11116>"]}]}

Over the past week, I have had the privilege to speaking to some students who I have not spoken to face-to-face about themselves musically. Throughout these interviews, I have made some interesting discoveries and learned more about each student’s affiliation to music before their post-secondary education and what music means to them on a personal level. The three candidates I have spoken to have had some sort of background of music in their early life, which is what I have focused on in these interviews. My first student I conversed with was one of my high school friends, Abbey Anthony, who is currently a 2nd year nursing student at Western University. Both Abbey and I attended the same elementary and secondary school (St. Mary’s Choir and Catholic Central High School respectively), although she was a grade higher than me. Because of that, we both were in the same music program throughout our time in school, having more or less the same musical experience. Within our conversation, I asked her if there was a time that music was of great importance in her life, and she responded, saying that high school was where she found that music was very important to deal with all of her problems. We moved on to talking about a mentor who inspired her through music, and strangely enough, we both had the same role model in mind; Donald (Duck) Sills. “He was phenomenal, and just made me see music in a whole different way.” I felt that Don was one of the reasons why Abbey feels music has such a great importance in today’s society. In particular, we talked more about how much she has learned from being under Don’s tutelage and what she felt about he taught music. “I definitely enjoyed [his teaching style] because a big thing for me with teachers is being personable and sharing with them. He has this remarkable way of both being very personable and [that] you feel like you’re on a same sharing basis, and I think that’s something that’s hard to do; to find that right balance.”\nWe also talked about her studies in university and her decision to focus on nursing rather than music. Despite being accepted into some schools for music, she felt that nursing was what she really wanted to go into. “It often crosses my mind of what would have happened if I have gone into music.” From this, I saw that she enjoyed the experience of music in high school, but that her aspirations of becoming a nurse were in the way of continuing into music However, I was pleased to know that if it were easier to take a double-major with music and nursing, she would not hesitate to go that route! The next student I talked to was one that I have not seen face-to-face in a few months. Stewart Finlay was one of my best friends growing up throughout elementary school and high school. Currently, he studies at Sault College in Sault St. Marie for aviation studies. Similar to Abbey, Stewart and I grew up having the same learning experience in music, being in the same grade, classes, ensembles, and having the same music teachers. One of the big questions I asked him in our interview was the importance of music to him. He says that everyone is exposed to music and that you can find it wherever you go. “It’s such an omnipresent being that just gives you energy and is an assistant to you to make you feel good about doing things.” I assumed the reason that music was significant to his life was due to his musical background. Stewart told me about the influence of his dad was one of the things that inspired him to study music. “My dad was in a choir school when he was younger, and him being involved in music and listening to all of that music made me listen to the music he listens to. And it just had a big impact on me in having all that music experience.” To no surprise, Don was another figure in his life that influenced his musical background. “His teaching style was just excellent. He’s very knowledgeable, and efficient.”\nDespite his musical background, Stewart had decided to go into the study of aviation. One of the driving factors being the influence of his dad and aviation. “I feel that my dad had a big impact on me for aviation because he was exposed to planes and made me want to fly planes. If I’m being honest, if I didn’t pursue a career in aviation, I’d probably be doing something in music because of my background and experience in music.” I felt that this made me feel content that people like Stewart would like to study more about music if it were possible in their academic schedule.\n\nB.

This section aims to support some of the many UK steelbands that have contributed to music education and many other aspects of their band member's educational development by playing steelpans. Each feature is unique in its own way, illustrating the different reasons why the steelbands were formed and how they are run. However, some common themes that are highlighted in each feature are:\n- Encouraging pupils to work independently or in a group. - Sharing experiences and presenting basic skills to others. - Gaining opportunities to engage in cultural events. - Exploring music and its role within society as a possible career. The features will hopefully encourage those wanting to start a steelband and newly developing steelbands to take a closer look at the various achievements accomplished, and to implement elements that may enhance their own projects. If you have a steelband and would like to share your experiences, please email your details\n\nI believe it is important for music learning and musical journey to be individual and personal, therefore, I also believe it is my responsibility as an educator to create a learning environment that allows students opportunities to create and reflect on their musical experience. My teaching philosophy is based on the plant and growth analogy, but I try to take it beyond watering. In addition to watering needs, every plant has specific sunlight, soil, fertilizer, and humidity needs. As such, you can not treat every plant exactly the same and expect them to thrive. I believe the same applies to students. I like to present my teaching ideas in multiple ways to allow students to choose the way that works best for them. What worked for me may not work for 75% of the students in my class. This philosophy based on individualization allows students to develop that all important, personal relationship with music. It was one or two teachers that made me connect with music that led me down this path of music study and therefore I hope to inspire the same love in my students. In addition to grasping the personal aspects of music, I am also well aware of the ethical and the administrative tasks that are tied with having a program. When I taught at the University of Tennessee as a graduate student, I had a couple cases where I needed to be in contact with the Title 9 office as well as the head of the school to address sensitive issues. While I hope to never deal with these issues again, I am comfortable speaking to the necessary people to follow protocol on these issues as well as others that could arise. Students will benefit from my instruction because they will get to choose their own journey in music, so to speak. We may all be learning the same song, but I hope and encourage students to make connections from the music to their own lives. As such, students will have chances to begin to develop their own philosophies about music and how they see the world. This is also be influenced by the diverse music presented to them.\n\n- The Percussion party! - Popular music in the classroom (1960’s- present day) Musical futures – Part 1\nIn the Autumn term the pupils rehearse, perform and evaluate a class performance of a score called, the Percussion Party. They will show understanding of the different signs and symbols used in the score and how the different parts are performed. A brief analysis of the score will take place showing an understanding of how the piece is organised. Pupils will take responsibility for their own part by working in a group of 6 and performing the piece independently. In the term 2, pupils form a band and share some of the experiences of being in a Rock band. They study popular music from the 1960’s through the decades. Part 1 is an introduction to the instruments in a Band and how they are played. They learn the song ‘Wild Thing’ and learn the basics of playing the Bass Guitar, Electric Guitar, Drum kit and Keyboard. During lessons the pupils will rehearse with their Band and organise a performance of the song which they perform to each other. The performances are filmed and used for assessment purposes. Pupils will also learn about Guitar notation, sing popular songs together as a class, learn about song structure and how popular music developed through the decades. - Popular music in the classroom Part 2 (Musical Futures)\nIn Part 2 of Popular music in the classroom, pupils organise their own arrangement of a song of their choice. They can either choose from a selection of songs or be responsible for choosing their own and organising the different parts. This part of their learning allows the pupils to work more independently, developing already existing skills. - An investigation into the musical genre ‘Blues’\nPupils recognise the genre by listening to examples of Blues music. They identify its musical features and show understanding by performing, using the Keyboard, the 12 bar blues chord sequence. Pupils learn a simple Blues tune, compose a Blues tune and lyrics for a song. They sing a selection of songs in the Blues style and learn about the origins and history of the Blues and its influences.\n\nI would teach children music, physics and philosophy: but most importantly music, for the patterns in music and all the arts are the keys to learning. (Plato)\nAt Greengate Lane Academy we expect the highest aspirations for our pupils. We want all children to learn and make academic progress no matter their starting points. We have a clear vision for what we want pupils to achieve during their time at Greengate Lane and have designed our curriculum to give all pupils the knowledge, skills and understanding they will need in their future years. Purpose of Education for Music\nAt Greengate Lane Academy, music enables our children to develop their knowledge and critically engage with a wide variety of music from different cultures and time periods. These skills help children to develop their skills in music and also begin to refine their individual tastes. Regardless of how long pupils are with us, be it their full primary years or just two or three, we intend for our pupils to:\n- develop their listening and response skills;\n- compose their own music using a variety of instruments;\n- perform and share the music they have created;\n- appraise the music of their peers and other music creators;\n- be exposed to music from a variety of cultures and time periods.

He had found a passion and, to my joy, it led to him rediscovering the piano. The result was a boy whose talent in music was astonishing. With limited piano training he began to play and play. His playing turned into improvisations and then into full scale compositions written for piano. His euphonium playing improved exponentially. By Grade 8, he soloed with the school's high school Senior Band. Caleb had a gift that went beyond words. His performances and his compositions were astounding and moving. Caleb never really grew to speak very well, but his voice and his thoughts and his emotions became music. Not every child or teenager in my music program rises to exceptional levels of playing. But, what music gives all of them is a voice, one that is distinctly their own. They learn to express themselves, to band together collectively, to convey emotion, to understand responsibility, and to demonstrate leadership. We all know the statistics of students who play music and how they do in schools. They score on average 19% higher in English and 17% higher in mathematics than those who do not take music. I am certain these figures are correct. My music students unequivocally make up the majority of top academic students at our school. They are leaders in council after council, and excellent role models. The philosophy in my music program is to teach kids to love music, feel good about themselves, and to NEVER underestimate their potential. I have found that one of the best ways for students to learn, is to teach. One of the best ways for kids to mature is to give them responsibility and put them in a position of leadership. Year after year, I have seen students like Amandeep, Ali and Caleb give back to the very program that began their musical education and love for music, and we have all been made richer for that. By the way, where is Caleb, the boy who thought music was a joke, heading next year? After having been a two time Provincial Honour Band member, a Canadian National Youth Band member, a member of the Toronto Youth Wind Orchestra, and this year a member of the prestigious Hannaford Youth Band, Caleb has been accepted to the University of Toronto to study Music Performance. I feel so proud of Caleb, and also of Amandeep, Ali and all of this year’s graduates. And, does it ever make it hard to say good-bye.\n\nWhy should I study Music Experience? Music Experience is a subject that will allow you to increase your knowledge and understanding of music. It will help you to develop skills with music theory and practice. If you love listening to music and want to understand more about how music works, and learn how to create your own original music and perform music, Music Experience will help you to develop these skills. Please note that Music Experience is not a course of instrumental tuition, and you need to already have some knowledge of how to play an instrument or sing before you enrol in this subject. You cannot learn to play an instrument through doing this subject. Where does Music Experience lead? Music Experience will help you to develop the foundations for further study in music. It will give you experience in performance and writing original music as well as critically analysing music, and you can use this knowledge to do further music study or work towards a career in the music industry. What work will I do in Music Experience? Music Experience is based on understanding music, responding to music, and creating music. In understanding music, you will develop critical listening skills and learn the vocabulary to discuss music and analyse it in detail. Responding to music gives you the opportunity to learn from the artists who inspire you. Creating music has two main parts – performance and composition. You will be assessed on a music performance, so to do this subject you need to be able to play an instrument or sing. Composition means you will write your own music, so this is a very creative part of the course. Music writing is done using software so you do not need to know how to read music to create something original and inspiring. What do other students think about Music Experience? Stage 1 Music Experience really helped me get my basics for music theory down, and I had a great time making music on GarageBand which has led me to want to study a Diploma of Music Industry (Sound Production) after year 12.Stage 1 Music Experience student\nI really enjoyed learning to use software, being creative with songs, and doing a performance because it helped me to improve my skills.Stage 1 Music Experience student\nWhere can I find more information about Music Experience?

Over the past week, I have had the privilege to speaking to some students who I have not spoken to face-to-face about themselves musically. Throughout these interviews, I have made some interesting discoveries and learned more about each student’s affiliation to music before their post-secondary education and what music means to them on a personal level. The three candidates I have spoken to have had some sort of background of music in their early life, which is what I have focused on in these interviews. My first student I conversed with was one of my high school friends, Abbey Anthony, who is currently a 2nd year nursing student at Western University. Both Abbey and I attended the same elementary and secondary school (St. Mary’s Choir and Catholic Central High School respectively), although she was a grade higher than me. Because of that, we both were in the same music program throughout our time in school, having more or less the same musical experience. Within our conversation, I asked her if there was a time that music was of great importance in her life, and she responded, saying that high school was where she found that music was very important to deal with all of her problems. We moved on to talking about a mentor who inspired her through music, and strangely enough, we both had the same role model in mind; Donald (Duck) Sills. “He was phenomenal, and just made me see music in a whole different way.” I felt that Don was one of the reasons why Abbey feels music has such a great importance in today’s society. In particular, we talked more about how much she has learned from being under Don’s tutelage and what she felt about he taught music. “I definitely enjoyed [his teaching style] because a big thing for me with teachers is being personable and sharing with them. He has this remarkable way of both being very personable and [that] you feel like you’re on a same sharing basis, and I think that’s something that’s hard to do; to find that right balance.”\nWe also talked about her studies in university and her decision to focus on nursing rather than music. Despite being accepted into some schools for music, she felt that nursing was what she really wanted to go into. “It often crosses my mind of what would have happened if I have gone into music.” From this, I saw that she enjoyed the experience of music in high school, but that her aspirations of becoming a nurse were in the way of continuing into music However, I was pleased to know that if it were easier to take a double-major with music and nursing, she would not hesitate to go that route! The next student I talked to was one that I have not seen face-to-face in a few months. Stewart Finlay was one of my best friends growing up throughout elementary school and high school. Currently, he studies at Sault College in Sault St. Marie for aviation studies. Similar to Abbey, Stewart and I grew up having the same learning experience in music, being in the same grade, classes, ensembles, and having the same music teachers. One of the big questions I asked him in our interview was the importance of music to him. He says that everyone is exposed to music and that you can find it wherever you go. “It’s such an omnipresent being that just gives you energy and is an assistant to you to make you feel good about doing things.” I assumed the reason that music was significant to his life was due to his musical background. Stewart told me about the influence of his dad was one of the things that inspired him to study music. “My dad was in a choir school when he was younger, and him being involved in music and listening to all of that music made me listen to the music he listens to. And it just had a big impact on me in having all that music experience.” To no surprise, Don was another figure in his life that influenced his musical background. “His teaching style was just excellent. He’s very knowledgeable, and efficient.”\nDespite his musical background, Stewart had decided to go into the study of aviation. One of the driving factors being the influence of his dad and aviation. “I feel that my dad had a big impact on me for aviation because he was exposed to planes and made me want to fly planes. If I’m being honest, if I didn’t pursue a career in aviation, I’d probably be doing something in music because of my background and experience in music.” I felt that this made me feel content that people like Stewart would like to study more about music if it were possible in their academic schedule.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ecc683c5-0d44-4e7e-86fb-78777a89eb47>"]},{"passage":"B.

My teaching philosophy is based on the plant and growth analogy, but I try to take it beyond watering. In addition to watering needs, every plant has specific sunlight, soil, fertilizer, and humidity needs. As such, you can not treat every plant exactly the same and expect them to thrive. I believe the same applies to students. I like to present my teaching ideas in multiple ways to allow students to choose the way that works best for them. What worked for me may not work for 75% of the students in my class. This philosophy based on individualization allows students to develop that all important, personal relationship with music. It was one or two teachers that made me connect with music that led me down this path of music study and therefore I hope to inspire the same love in my students. In addition to grasping the personal aspects of music, I am also well aware of the ethical and the administrative tasks that are tied with having a program. When I taught at the University of Tennessee as a graduate student, I had a couple cases where I needed to be in contact with the Title 9 office as well as the head of the school to address sensitive issues. While I hope to never deal with these issues again, I am comfortable speaking to the necessary people to follow protocol on these issues as well as others that could arise. Students will benefit from my instruction because they will get to choose their own journey in music, so to speak. We may all be learning the same song, but I hope and encourage students to make connections from the music to their own lives. As such, students will have chances to begin to develop their own philosophies about music and how they see the world.

However, I think we can all benefit from talking about the hard things, the things that we would rather keep to ourselves, in the fear that the other person might not understand. Be that as a parent to their child, or a person with CP to their parent.\nThroughout the years I’ve battled with my own emotions and thoughts about having CP. I somehow managed to get through it all and end up as a relatively happy person on the other end, even though some parts of the struggle never ends. When talking to my own parents, and other parents, both through this blog and outside of it I gained a deeper appreciation of all the battles they have fought with themselves. Out of these conversations, there seems to be three different categories to group these difficult feelings and thoughts into: Guilt, Loss and Regret.\nGuilt relating to the CP can be a few different things. It could be that you as a parent feel that you are to blame for your child ending up with CP, that it is somehow your fault. Maybe, you didn’t do enough? What if you only had eaten healthier? Maybe you were too stressed during pregnancy? Well let you tell you right now, it´s not your fault. Cerebral Palsy is not genetic, and its causes are difficult to ascertain exactly, but we know it comes directly from a lack of oxygen to the brain. Your child loves you, as the one that cares for them deeper than anyone else, they don’t blame you for the CP, neither should you.\nGuilt can come creeping in other forms as well, maybe you feel bad for not being there as much as you could for your child, or maybe you feel you are overprotecting them or sheltering them too much? As someone with CP, I can say that I have felt overprotected or sheltered at times. And sure, it may let to some outbursts of anger or frustration, especially in my teens. Do I hold any sort of grudge or feeling of resentment towards my parents today for this? Not at all.\nI’m not a parent myself so I can’t speak from experience, but it seems from my viewpoint that parents of kids with CP balance on a constant tightrope, on one side they want to grant their child freedom and independence, so that they won’t feel so isolated or dependent on you as a parent. On the other side, you know the reality of the world out there, of the bullies, of the judgment of others and of the mental hardships they may have to endure when they realize their dream may be stopped because of the CP.\nI think what you have to consider when facing all these difficult situations is this. Your child loves you, admires you, and looks to you for guidance, even if they don’t tell you straight up. They know you are there for them if things get really though. Life didn’t prepare you for the challenge of having a child with Cerebral Palsy. And considering that both the parent and child are just thrown into it head first with no instruction manual, you are doing pretty awesome, just getting through the day.\nJust as other parents who do not have a child with CP, do not understand the perspective that you as a parent come from. It’s important to remember that we, as people with CP, view that as “normal”. Life with Cerebral Palsy is all I know, and most likely is all I will ever know, and I am completely fine with that. But because of that it shapes my view on life, my motivations and my thoughts, that are going to be different than an able bodied in some way. Which leads me to the next topic Loss and Regret.\nP.S. Feel free to read this post entirely about guilt as it relates to CP.\nLoss And Regret\nI decided to group these two together because they pretty closely related. If you feel loss as a parent because of the CP, chances are regret follows closely behind. It’s completely normal for you to feel loss as a parent, to feel loss that your son or daughter won’t have the life of an able bodied child. To feel the loss of that opportunity taken away from you, and taken away from you’re child. Its also normal for you to feel regret about all the things in daily life that your child may miss out on as a result of the CP. This does not make you a bad parent. Nor does it make you selfish.\nAs someone with CP, I’ve felt loss and regret to because of the CP. I felt loss when I realized I had to give up my dream as a kid to become a professional soccer player, and I’ve felt both feelings when I couldn’t participate in something with my friends or felt like an outsider. But as I’ve gotten older I’ve grown to appreciate something that has always been there as a part of the CP, and that is my initial perspective on life.\nAs I mentioned above, life with CP is all I know, and all I will know. This has some really good benefits. It means that I won’t always feel the need or desire to be closer to “normal”, simply because I have no idea what it means to not have CP, I can’t really imagine it. This can create some conflicts between the person with CP and their loved ones too. Where the parents for example may want to push their child to exercise more, stretch more, or try harder to walk or walk better, the person with CP, may be content with their functional level as it is, and may not see the point.\nWe both have a responsibility here. The parent should try to understand this, that we don’t necessarily want to be just like an able bodied. Some may, but that may lead to more harm than good. You can’t change the CP; you can’t cure it, at least not right now. And because of that, if you are constantly want something you cannot have, and constantly hating what you have and what you are, you are going to be pretty miserable. Therefore, I would advise you, as a parent to help your child accept their CP rather than fight it. It is not your enemy, nor is it theirs, its a part of them.\nAs people with CP we also have to understand that even if we don’t always see the change the point in stretching or exercises, or even surgeries, we should try to think of the fact that we want to stay happy in the future. The work that you put down now, can be really important later down the road. I used to hate this kind of reasoning however, and I am not expecting you to like it either, so if that doesn’t motivate you, try to find smaller more achievable goals of improvement that you can see in a shorter time period.\nAlso, remember that because your parents want you to exercise more, or walk better or what have you, it doesn’t mean they think you aren’t good enough, you are, and its not about that. They view life from their perspective, and what they have been able to do and enjoy in life, they just want you to feel many of the joys in life that they have, because they love you, not because they don’t think you’re good enough.\nIt is my hope that we can continue to learn from each other, and grow together. That way, we can heal each other and the scars that may open, so I hope you will accept and embrace this open letter as my contribution towards that.\nIf you have had any of these feelings and experiences, either as a parent or as someone with CP, please feel free to comment below and share on your favourite social media, it really helps us grow and write more of these articles!

However, I think we can all benefit from talking about the hard things, the things that we would rather keep to ourselves, in the fear that the other person might not understand. Be that as a parent to their child, or a person with CP to their parent. Throughout the years I’ve battled with my own emotions and thoughts about having CP. I somehow managed to get through it all and end up as a relatively happy person on the other end, even though some parts of the struggle never ends. When talking to my own parents, and other parents, both through this blog and outside of it I gained a deeper appreciation of all the battles they have fought with themselves. Out of these conversations, there seems to be three different categories to group these difficult feelings and thoughts into: Guilt, Loss and Regret. Guilt relating to the CP can be a few different things. It could be that you as a parent feel that you are to blame for your child ending up with CP, that it is somehow your fault. Maybe, you didn’t do enough? What if you only had eaten healthier? Maybe you were too stressed during pregnancy? Well let you tell you right now, it´s not your fault. Cerebral Palsy is not genetic, and its causes are difficult to ascertain exactly, but we know it comes directly from a lack of oxygen to the brain. Your child loves you, as the one that cares for them deeper than anyone else, they don’t blame you for the CP, neither should you. Guilt can come creeping in other forms as well, maybe you feel bad for not being there as much as you could for your child, or maybe you feel you are overprotecting them or sheltering them too much? As someone with CP, I can say that I have felt overprotected or sheltered at times. And sure, it may let to some outbursts of anger or frustration, especially in my teens. Do I hold any sort of grudge or feeling of resentment towards my parents today for this? Not at all.

There are a lot of misconceptions about raising a child with CP. Knowing all of the facts might help alleviate the stress of raising a child with special needs. What Is Cerebral Palsy? CP is a group of disorders that affects the white matter in the brain, which is responsible for balance, coordination, and fine motor control. Cerebral palsy is known to be the most common cause of motor disability in children, and it affects an estimated 500,000 Americans. There are three main types of CP:\n- Spastic CP (stiff muscles)\n- Dyskinetic CP (involuntary movement)\n- Ataxic CP (difficulty with coordination and balance)\nEvery case of CP is different in terms of type and severity, so knowing exactly what kind of CP your child is dealing with and how severe it is can help guide your expectations and manage your anxiety. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Spastic CP is the most common type and comprises about 80% of all people with CP. There are three types of spastic CP: spastic diplegia\/diparesis, spastic hemiplegia\/hemiparesis, and spastic quadriplegia\/quadriparesis. People with spastic diplegia\/diparesis experience muscle stiffness mainly in the legs. There may or may not be stiffness in the arms, but if there is, it will be milder. Spastic hemiplegia\/hemiparesis affects the arms more than the legs, and its symptoms manifest on one side of the body only. According to the Children’s Hemiplegia and Stroke Association (CHASA), the symptoms of spastic hemiplegia will manifest on the side of the body opposite the affected side of the brain; this can help you determine which side of your child’s brain is affected and what to expect from your child from a developmental point of view. This is the most severe form of spastic CP and affects all the body’s limbs. People with spastic quadriplegia\/quadriparesis are usually unable to walk; spastic quadriplegia\/quadriparesis is often coupled with intellectual disabilities and seizures. Dyskinetic CP causes involuntary movements in the hands and feet, which can make it difficult to walk or sit. Dyskinetic CP may also affect the tongue and cheeks, responsible for all mouth movements, such as swallowing and speaking. Ataxic CP affects coordination. This means that people with this form of CP have difficulty with fine motor skills such as writing, tying their shoes, or reaching for objects. Ataxic CP might make a person’s walk awkward, but it doesn’t usually prevent people from walking altogether. Some of the most frightening worries about raising a child with CP are misconceptions. Instead of fearing the worst, you should keep in mind that CP may not limit your child’s ability as much as you’d think. Try not to cater to any of the following fallacies:\nA Child With CP Can’t Succeed\nFor the vast majority of kids with CP, there’s no truth to this whatsoever. Less than half of the children with CP show intellectual impairment, so don’t make the mistake of giving your child limitations they may not actually have. A Child With CP Will Be Unable to Work\nA difficult situation should not turn into something impossible. If you help your child develop a skill or passion, their failure is far from guaranteed. As long as you keep an open and positive mind, whilst always encouraging and supporting your child, you may be surprised to see what they are capable of. A Child With CP Can’t Have a Normal Life\nFirstly, there is no such thing. Secondly, coming up with limitations and barriers for your child could turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy, so be patient and maintain a positive attitude. Your child’s future depends on having you in their corner. ” This article is a collaboration with a freelance writer and follows The Haitian Times publishing guidelines”\n\nAs parents of kids with CF, we can make a life-transforming difference by focusing as much on their mental health as we do on their physical health. If you think your child's CF is taking an emotional toll, asking yourself these questions may help. Lisa C. Greene, M.A., CFLE\nSeptember 29, 2015\nRegister Today to Learn More About the Latest in CF Research and Care\nYou Did It! EACT Passed in The House\nNot too long ago I had a conversation with an amazing dad who is concerned about his 15-year-old daughter. She has cystic fibrosis and it's taking a toll on her emotionally. She's been hospitalized a lot and is not doing well at school. He is afraid that she is giving up, and he needed ideas for how to turn it around. Certainly there are no easy answers here, but if you are the parent of a teen with CF and can relate to this dad's experience, here are some questions that may help. 1. First, is your child depressed? Working closely with your child's care team, you may consider taking your child to a professional who is experienced with working with people who have chronic illnesses. They can identify whether or not your teen is clinically depressed or if she is “simply” disheartened. People with chronic illnesses, such as CF, have a higher rate of depression and anxiety. Getting professional help early is the first line of defense. 2. What brings your child joy? Without having something to look forward to in life, people get tired of living. Sometimes it takes a little effort to figure out what brings your child joy. I worked with one mom whose 14-year-old son with CF was struggling emotionally. She knew that he loved animals, so this mom made arrangements at the local zoo for her son to volunteer periodically. This really helped give him something to look forward to and work toward as a possible career down the road. It gave him just enough hope and joy to get through some rough spots. 3. Are you purposeful about having fun and connecting as a family? With our own two kids who have CF, we have always made it a priority to have fun as a family. It's not always easy; we have to drag around a lot of medical equipment everywhere we go. But it's a priority for us, so we do what it takes. After medical clinic visits when our kids were little, we'd go to the zoo, a children's museum, a park or out to somewhere fun for lunch. We still go out after clinic when we can. When our daughter was hospitalized for several days, we “busted” her out of the hospital (with permission) to see the premiere of “The Hunger Games” with her friends. Everyday life affords many opportunities to make memories. Studies have shown that investing more time, energy and money in life experiences, i.e., \"having fun,\" makes you happier than buying \"stuff.\" I believe this approach has been a big part of our kids having a good attitude about cystic fibrosis, enjoying their lives and being connected as a family. Family traditions, time together, fun experiences … these are the things that lend a sense of hope and meaning, especially during the hard times. 4. Does your teen have a vision for his or her life? Sometimes when kids have a serious and progressive chronic illness like CF, they have a hard time seeing past the illness to a future. It's important that we encourage and empower our children to dream and plan. With many illnesses, including CF, there is so much hope for the future! 5. Can you connect your child with a good role model? Sometimes when a parent tries to encourage their teen directly, the child dismisses what their parent has to say with, “You don't understand. You're not the one with CF.” In these situations, it can really help to share positive, powerful role models who are as much like the child as possible. And by the way parents, what brings you joy? Are you taking good care of yourself, making sure you get your batteries recharged and having fun every now and then? Do you have a sense of purpose and meaning for your life (outside of living for your children)? Your positive example speaks more than words and lectures. Lisa C. Greene, M.A., CFLE\nMother of two teens with CF\nAs a national public speaker, Lisa speaks to parents and medical professionals about parenting, medical adherence, transition, and resilience.

Cerebral palsy appears in early childhood or infancy and occurs in about 2.1 of every 1,000 children. While there is no way to fully prevent or cure CP, the condition can be managed in a way that maximizes independence and quality of life for affected individuals. Take the Next Step\nThe key next step for parents is finding the best care for your child. Our multidisciplinary team includes a range of specialists to help with even the most complex mobility challenges. What Is Cerebral Palsy? Cerebral palsy is caused by abnormal development in the part of the brain that controls muscle movement and coordination. There are three types of cerebral palsy:\n- Spastic cerebral palsy causes muscle stiffness and movement difficulty\n- Athetoid cerebral palsy causes involuntary movements\n- Ataxic cerebral palsy leads to problems with balance and depth perception\nIn Motion: 5K Prep\nMeet up at the front entrance of Dell Children’s Medical Center, from 10:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. Ages 5 and up are welcome.

Cerebral Palsy Causes\nMost commonly, cerebral palsy develops in the fetus, but the condition can also develop during infancy or early childhood. The causes of CP are not always identifiable, but many cases can be linked to infection or exposure to radiation during pregnancy, fetal growth restriction or complications during labor. Birth asphyxia, seizures, respiratory problems and low blood sugar during or immediately after birth can also lead to CP. In very young children, cerebral palsy can be caused by lead poisoning, stroke, near drowning, encephalitis, meningitis, shaken baby syndrome or jaundice. Rarely, cases of CP are genetic. Cerebral Palsy Diagnosis\nCerebral palsy is usually initially diagnosed by a physical exam assessing general movements, especially in children 4 months of age or younger. Neuroimaging tests such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to determine the cause of CP, but are usually not necessary for a diagnosis. Cerebral Palsy Treatment\nTreatment of cerebral palsy focuses on maximizing independence for each individual with the disorder. Treatment of CP is a lifelong process that can include medication, therapy, surgery or a combination. Therapy can begin as soon as CP is diagnosed and may include physical therapy, speech therapy and therapy for social and emotional development. Medications can help improve muscle stiffness or pain, while braces can assist with walking and other movements. In some cases, orthopedic surgery can repair dislocated hips or abnormal spine curvature such as scoliosis. By focusing on a long-term vision of independence and quality of life from infancy through adulthood, our team of specialists can help infants, children and adolescents with cerebral palsy enjoy activities and hobbies that promote empowerment and enjoyment with as few limitations as possible. - CPATH – Central Texas support group for families & individuals living with cerebral palsy\n- Cerebral Palsy Research Registry\n- American Academy for Cerebral Palsy & Developmental Medicine\n- CP Daily Living\n- United Cerebral Palsy Resource Guide\n- The Cerebral Palsy International Research Foundation (CPIRF)\n- Let’s Cure CP\n\nInfluenced by theory and research on human attachment, loss, and caregiving (Bonanno & Kaltman, 1999; Bowlby, 1988; Pianta, Marvin, & Morog, 1999), this perspective emphasizes that when a child is born with special needs, parents have to let go of and grieve for their expectations and images of their anticipated or “hoped for” child (Moses, 1988). Developing a representation or schema of their child's actual, in contrast to their wished for, abilities facilitates parents' ability to respond sensitively to their child, thereby promoting a secure relationship with their child. At various levels of awareness, all potential parents have fantasies about their children and their child's future. These hopes and dreams intensify during pregnancy. Parents imagine the kind of person their child will become, the relationships they will have with him or her, and the pride and joy they will experience as a parent. We view these seemingly narcissistic and self-indulgent daydreams to be a normal part of the attachment process. They prepare parents to form attachments to the helpless and dependent newborn who will soon arrive. They help parents to make the long and difficult selfsacrifice and investment needed to raise children. However, high hopes and expectations may be a liability. They can be crushed when a child is born with a medical condition or disability. For many of these parents, a complicated process—similar to bereavement—begins (Emde & Brown, 1978). Some common parental experiences at the outset of this process are listed in Table 1. We believe that many parents and professionals are slow or fail to recognize this process of grieving and adaptation. One of the complications has been identifying for whom the parents are grieving. Physically, their baby is not lost; he or she is right there with them. Instead, these parents are grieving for their hoped for child—the child they were expecting who never arrived (Moses, 1988). Parents have to adjust their expectations and hopes for their child in the face of the substantial uncertainties inherent in their child's medical, motor, intellectual, and social prognosis. Emotionally and cognitively, parents must come to terms with their child's condition. Pianta, Marvin, and colleagues (Marvin & Pianta, 1996; Pianta et al., 1999; Pianta, Marvin, Britner, & Borowitz, 1996) have examined parental reactions and developed a technique for assessing parents' state of mind regarding their child's diagnosis. On the basis of their responses to a brief, semistructured interview, parents are rated on the degree to which they have resolved their thoughts and feelings about their child's condition. In Pianta and Marvin's scheme, parental resolution is marked by an integration of the facts and realities associated with their child's condition along with emotional reactions to the diagnosis. This integration is present in both their mental images of their child and their relationship with him or her. Indices of resolved and unresolved reactions are presented in Table 2. Like grief and mourning (Bowlby, 1980), parental reactions to diagnosis are thought to be determined by a complex set of processes related to personality, relationship history, and how one has learned to process information about emotions and relationships. Mothers' resolution of their child's diagnosis has been found to be significantly associated with a variety of measures of parent and family functioning including maternal mental health, perceived social support, and husbands' ratings of the marital relationship (Sheeran, Marvin, & Pianta, 1997). Notably, lack of maternal resolution of child diagnosis has been shown to be strongly associated with the formation of an insecure attachment in the diagnosed child (Barnett et al., 1999; Marvin & Pianta, 1996; Pianta et al., 1999). From this research, we have hypothesized that parents who are unresolved regarding their child's diagnosis have difficulty responding sensitively to their child. We believe that until parents have achieved a balanced view of their child, they will have difficulty accurately reading their child's signals and providing their child with a secure base from which to explore new relationships, learn to trust others, develop social skills, and feel lovable and efficacious. THE ADAPTATION PROCESS\nAlthough researchers and clinicians use the terms resolution and acceptance, we have chosen to emphasize the term adaptation when we work directly with parents.\n\nHow to recognize and refer children with hemiplegic (unilateral) cerebral palsy\nWhat is cerebral palsy? Cerebral palsy, or CP, refers to a group of developmental conditions that have several features in common. All are caused by some kind of injury to the developing brain. The injury can occur in the womb, during the birth of the baby, or in the first couple of years after birth. Common risk factors for CP include prematurity, low birth weight, multiple gestation, and infection.1\nindividuals in Canada are diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy (CP)\nIn Canada CP affects 1 in every 400 individuals and is the most common physical disability in children. The hallmark disability for individuals with CP is related to motor function – how a person develops and maintains control of their movement. Children with CP almost always have issues with whole-body movement, including walking, and often in using their hands and arms. In addition, they may also have other challenges resulting from their brain injury, including problems with seizures, learning, communicating, vision and hearing, and behaviour. What is hemiplegic or unilateral CP? of children diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy have hemiplegic CP. ‘Hemiplegia’, ‘hemiparesis’, or ‘unilateral’ CP affects the movement and muscle tone on one side of the body, although often the other side of the body may be affected to a lesser extent.2 It is the most common form of CP, with estimates ranging from 33-39% of all people with CP.3,4 A ‘stroke’ in the time before, during or after birth is the most common cause of hemiplegic CP. Multiple factors may interact to block the blood vessels in the brain and cause a stroke. Many times the cause of the stroke will never be known.5 As one side of the brain is injured, the opposite side of the body is affected; this can result in weakness of an arm, leg, or both on one side of the body. Sixty percent of children with hemiplegic CP have seizures in the newborn period. What are the early signs of hemiplegic CP? Hemiplegic CP frequently presents in the first year of life when parents notice a hand preference, which is very unusual in children at this age. Other signs include fisting of one hand and flexion (bending) of the elbow on the affected side. In supported standing, the child may stand flatfooted on their more functional side and up on the toes of the hemiplegic side. Likewise, the child may not bear weight well through the affected hand or foot. Some asymmetry in function might be noted when the child is crawling or attempting other motor activities and as a result the child’s crawling is often delayed. For children under the age of 18 months, some ‘red flags’ include:\n- Favouring one hand, leaving the other hand in a fist or reaching across their body to grab objects, or not bringing both hands together during play\n- Delays in early motor milestones – rolling, sitting, pulling to stand, crawling, and walking\n- Stiffness or weakness in muscles on one side of the body\n- Difficulty with the early development of walking and balance\n- Asymmetrical movement and posture\nHow is hemiplegic CP diagnosed? Hemiplegia is a condition best recognized by the story the parents tell and the observations we make when watching children in action. An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) brain scan is the preferred method of neuroimaging for CP.3 MRI is useful for identifying the presence and location of a brain injury in almost 90% of children with CP.6 Children with hemiplegia commonly have abnormal cranial ultrasounds. What is the outlook for children with hemiplegic CP? The gross motor function of 88% of children with hemiplegia is classified as GMFCS level 1.7\nThis means that almost all children with hemiplegia can walk by 2 years of age without assistive devices, and by age 6 can:\n- Walk long distances outdoors and on uneven surfaces\n- Move from the floor or a chair to standing without using their hands for support\n- Go up and down stairs without needing to hold the handrail\n- Are beginning to run and jump. Some potential challenges include:\n- Difficulties with voluntary movement in one arm, for instance difficulty opening their hand, picking up small objects, turning the hand over. In the leg, there may be toe walking on the one side which can cause tripping.\n\nNo one can relate to what I go through. You need to have a good caregiver since they do not come cheap owing to what it entails to bring her up. You constantly have to plan for the future since there is the overwhelming thought of what would happen should I die tomorrow as my child is totally dependent on me; it’s a very scary feeling. Who has been your biggest support? It’s funny how people get offended when I say I don’t have anybody giving me the type of support I need. Occasionally, friends will support in terms of buying nappies or whatever essentials for her and I’m always grateful for that, but in terms of bearing the load and walking in my shoes, it’s me, God and the caregivers that I employ. I don’t hold grudges because, at the end of the day, she is my daughter to take care of. What advice can you share with new parents of children living with Cerebral Palsy? They should always know that they are their children’s best advocates, listen to their instincts, and research as much as possible about the different treatment options available out there. There are various organisations like Bravehearts Special Needs Association where parents of children living with CP have come together to support each other and raise awareness.\n\nGroup facilitators invite the parents to respond to particular stories, feelings, dreams, and questions from the tape that either match or differ from their own experiences. As a homework assignment, parents are asked to write a letter to, or draw a picture of their hoped for child. Although their letters and pictures are not shared with their child, they are asked to reflect on the hopes and dreams they had for their child before learning of their child's medical diagnosis. Sessions 4 and 5: Giving ourselves time\nThe goals of these sessions are to help parents accept their reactions to their child, develop realistic expectations of themselves, and identify the challenges that lie ahead. Understandably, many parents try to deny or avoid their negative reactions to their child and their child's condition. They may feel pressure to “get over” it. They may feel a lack of empathy from others. We believe efforts to avoid, minimize, or hurry negative feelings interferes with the adaptation process. Consequently, we work to normalize parents' reactions and distress, encouraging them to explore rather than avoid these feelings. The facilitator reviews the stages included in the book Nobody's Perfect: surviving, searching, settling in, and separating. As previously mentioned, the “stages” in the process of adapting to a disability diagnosis are not necessarily sequential, often overlap, repeat, and do not imply closure or completion. We help parents to realize that adaptation is a lifelong process and to identify important emotional milestones that accompany their struggle to build new dreams for their child. Catalysts for movement from one stage to another as well as stage overlap and repetition are discussed. The book is also used to help parents identify their strengths and abilities and to learn additional ways to handle difficult times. Parents are invited to share the ways that they have worked through or handled the challenges of each stage. Chapter 7 of Miller's book, entitled “Taking care of you,” is used to emphasize the importance of parents attending to their own needs. Session 6: Slowly rebuilding new dreams\nThe goal of this session is to encourage parents to take new steps in adapting to their child. In this session, parents reflect on their journey up to this point, and they identify their strengths. They consider what their families have done well and the benefits of those experiences. Participants share stories of hope and progress. In the context of reminders of the unfolding nature of their child's development and personality, parents begin to explore new dreams for their child and for themselves as parents. Parents are asked to participate in an art activity in which the instructions are to create 2 pictures\/symbols: the first depicting their surroundings and their mood immediately after learning of their child's disability and the second depicting their current mood and surroundings. Parents are then asked to reflect on what has changed since they first learned of their child's disability. Session 7: Relating to others\nThe goal of this session is to provide information to boost coping strategies and improve the parents' relationships with family and friends. This session addresses concerns regarding the impact of the child's special needs on the parent and on spousal, sibling, and extended family relationships. Stress, conflict resolution, prioritizing, and other common challenges to relationships within the family are considered. Different ways of responding to and coping with stress are described. Particular attention is given to improving communication and reducing stress in the relationships between mothers and fathers. We encourage mothers and fathers to attend, but in many cases this is not possible. We encourage a group dialogue about stepparents and situations where parents are and are not living together. To clarify differences in how mothers and fathers respond to having a child with a medical condition or disability, group members are asked to read excerpts from Donald Meyer's book Uncommon Fathers: Reflections on Raising a Child With a Disability (Meyer, 1995). Group members offer examples and suggestions for meeting various challenges so that they can maintain satisfying, mutually supportive relationships with family members. Session 8: Relating to my child\nThe goal of this session is to encourage and reinforce sensitive parenting and to acknowledge the formal ending of the group curriculum. In this session, the significance of parental behavior and emotional reactions to the child's developing sense of trust and security are explored. Group leaders discuss how physical closeness and touch communicate comfort and security to children. Parents are encouraged to learn their child's unique ways of communicating.\n\nProvide reassurance to the child that the parent will help them deal with whatever problems exist; however, a clear message that the parent expects the child to attend school is also appropriate. Communication with the child regarding problems, brainstorming solutions, and following up with a discussion after school are all possible strategies for parents to employ. 715. List three examples that show a child is ready for SELF-CARE. (178)\nBe able to solicit help from friends, neighbors, and designated helpers when appropriate. Be able to understand and remember verbal and written instructions. Manipulate locks and doors so that they will not be locked in or out. 716. List two rules\/restrictions parents should have for school-age children when it comes to television and\/or video games. (182-183)\nLimit the amount of TV watched. Monitor content of the shows the children watch. A prolonged sense of hopelessness and frustration. Depression is often masked with extreme restlessness and fatigue. 912. List three signs that an adolescent is considering SUICIDE. (196)\nWithdrawal from friends and activities, talk or thoughts of suicide or death, and making final arrangements (giving away prized possessions, making peace with friends, etc.). 1001. List three reasons an adult might return to live with his\/her parents. (210)\nUnemployment, low salaries, high housing costs, educational needs, and divorce. 1002. List and describe 2 ROLES FOR GRANDPARENTS. (215-216)\nFamily Watchdog – vigilant watchers making sure the family system as a whole is maintained. Historian - They can give grandchildren a sense of family history and belonging by relating stories from the past. 1003. Describe 2 problems faced by grandparents after divorce and\/or remarriage (of their grandchildren’s parents). (218-219)\nThe divorce of an adult child disrupts the established links in the extended family system, thus necessitating a renegotiation of relationships. Because the typical custody pattern in the United States usually translates into children living with their mothers, the ties between paternal grandparents and their grandchildren are often weakened. 1004. Describe three ways that grandparents can maintain close relationships with grandchildren who live hundreds or thousands of miles away. (219)\nTelephone calls, Letters, cassette tapes & photographs. 1005. Describe three forms of help an elderly parent may need. (224-227)\nTransportation for needed or desired activities. Housing – may require taking the parent into the child’s house. Homemaking – help with the basic task of daily living, including meal preparation, cleaning, and laundry, shopping for needed foods, clothing and so on. 1101. List 3 problems faced by SINGLE PARENTS. (236-241)\nOne parent can only model one gender role. The single parent faces role overload and economic difficulties. 1102. Describe 3 problems experienced by children whose parents are divorcing. (242-244, Art. 19)\nThey may be confused and illogically conclude that the separation is their fault. They can deny the separation is occurring and fantasize about parental reconciliation. When told that the parents no longer love each other, they may become fearful of losing parental love themselves or of being abandoned. 1103. Describe three ways that divorcing parents should talk to kids about divorce. (477-Sant, M&C - 242-244)\nIt is important to tell children as soon as a decision is made. When children are initially informed, both parents and all siblings should be present. Reassure children that they are still loved by both parents. 1104. Describe two problems faced by NONCUSTODIAL PARENTS. (245)\nThe custodial parent may move away and distance disrupts available time to visit. The child’s life gets so complicated that the non-custodial parent did not want to take the time to stay involved. Disney Land fathers don’t create real relationships. Their visitation is just one special event after another rather than a relationship with real meaning. 1105. Describe two problems faced by STEPPARENTS. (250-253)\nLife in step-families requires continual and deliberate effort, and constant attention to the evolving relationships. Step-parents often feel hurt, frustrated, and disappointed because they fail to instantly establish a loving relationship with their newly acquired stepchildren. 1202. Describe three additional stresses on parents of children with disabilities. (261-265)\nThe diagnosis is a painful event in the life of the parent. Securing appropriate services is an ongoing stressful event that will be present always.\n\nWhich of rights of parents presented in this chapter do you feel\nyou have not yet used?

However, I think we can all benefit from talking about the hard things, the things that we would rather keep to ourselves, in the fear that the other person might not understand. Be that as a parent to their child, or a person with CP to their parent. Throughout the years I’ve battled with my own emotions and thoughts about having CP. I somehow managed to get through it all and end up as a relatively happy person on the other end, even though some parts of the struggle never ends. When talking to my own parents, and other parents, both through this blog and outside of it I gained a deeper appreciation of all the battles they have fought with themselves. Out of these conversations, there seems to be three different categories to group these difficult feelings and thoughts into: Guilt, Loss and Regret. Guilt relating to the CP can be a few different things. It could be that you as a parent feel that you are to blame for your child ending up with CP, that it is somehow your fault. Maybe, you didn’t do enough? What if you only had eaten healthier? Maybe you were too stressed during pregnancy? Well let you tell you right now, it´s not your fault. Cerebral Palsy is not genetic, and its causes are difficult to ascertain exactly, but we know it comes directly from a lack of oxygen to the brain. Your child loves you, as the one that cares for them deeper than anyone else, they don’t blame you for the CP, neither should you. Guilt can come creeping in other forms as well, maybe you feel bad for not being there as much as you could for your child, or maybe you feel you are overprotecting them or sheltering them too much? As someone with CP, I can say that I have felt overprotected or sheltered at times. And sure, it may let to some outbursts of anger or frustration, especially in my teens. Do I hold any sort of grudge or feeling of resentment towards my parents today for this? Not at all. I’m not a parent myself so I can’t speak from experience, but it seems from my viewpoint that parents of kids with CP balance on a constant tightrope, on one side they want to grant their child freedom and independence, so that they won’t feel so isolated or dependent on you as a parent. On the other side, you know the reality of the world out there, of the bullies, of the judgment of others and of the mental hardships they may have to endure when they realize their dream may be stopped because of the CP. I think what you have to consider when facing all these difficult situations is this. Your child loves you, admires you, and looks to you for guidance, even if they don’t tell you straight up. They know you are there for them if things get really though. Life didn’t prepare you for the challenge of having a child with Cerebral Palsy. And considering that both the parent and child are just thrown into it head first with no instruction manual, you are doing pretty awesome, just getting through the day. Just as other parents who do not have a child with CP, do not understand the perspective that you as a parent come from. It’s important to remember that we, as people with CP, view that as “normal”. Life with Cerebral Palsy is all I know, and most likely is all I will ever know, and I am completely fine with that. But because of that it shapes my view on life, my motivations and my thoughts, that are going to be different than an able bodied in some way. Which leads me to the next topic Loss and Regret. P.S. Feel free to read this post entirely about guilt as it relates to CP. Loss And Regret\nI decided to group these two together because they pretty closely related. If you feel loss as a parent because of the CP, chances are regret follows closely behind. It’s completely normal for you to feel loss as a parent, to feel loss that your son or daughter won’t have the life of an able bodied child. To feel the loss of that opportunity taken away from you, and taken away from you’re child. Its also normal for you to feel regret about all the things in daily life that your child may miss out on as a result of the CP. This does not make you a bad parent. Nor does it make you selfish.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:7ef0cf77-a406-4750-beb2-be4205253fd4>"]},{"passage":"Raising a child with Cerebral Palsy (CP) can seem like an insurmountable task, and it will definitely be a challenge, but that’s no reason to despair. There are a lot of misconceptions about raising a child with CP. Knowing all of the facts might help alleviate the stress of raising a child with special needs. What Is Cerebral Palsy? CP is a group of disorders that affects the white matter in the brain, which is responsible for balance, coordination, and fine motor control. Cerebral palsy is known to be the most common cause of motor disability in children, and it affects an estimated 500,000 Americans. There are three main types of CP:\n- Spastic CP (stiff muscles)\n- Dyskinetic CP (involuntary movement)\n- Ataxic CP (difficulty with coordination and balance)\nEvery case of CP is different in terms of type and severity, so knowing exactly what kind of CP your child is dealing with and how severe it is can help guide your expectations and manage your anxiety. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Spastic CP is the most common type and comprises about 80% of all people with CP. There are three types of spastic CP: spastic diplegia\/diparesis, spastic hemiplegia\/hemiparesis, and spastic quadriplegia\/quadriparesis. People with spastic diplegia\/diparesis experience muscle stiffness mainly in the legs. There may or may not be stiffness in the arms, but if there is, it will be milder. Spastic hemiplegia\/hemiparesis affects the arms more than the legs, and its symptoms manifest on one side of the body only. According to the Children’s Hemiplegia and Stroke Association (CHASA), the symptoms of spastic hemiplegia will manifest on the side of the body opposite the affected side of the brain; this can help you determine which side of your child’s brain is affected and what to expect from your child from a developmental point of view. This is the most severe form of spastic CP and affects all the body’s limbs. People with spastic quadriplegia\/quadriparesis are usually unable to walk; spastic quadriplegia\/quadriparesis is often coupled with intellectual disabilities and seizures. Dyskinetic CP causes involuntary movements in the hands and feet, which can make it difficult to walk or sit. Dyskinetic CP may also affect the tongue and cheeks, responsible for all mouth movements, such as swallowing and speaking. Ataxic CP affects coordination. This means that people with this form of CP have difficulty with fine motor skills such as writing, tying their shoes, or reaching for objects. Ataxic CP might make a person’s walk awkward, but it doesn’t usually prevent people from walking altogether. Some of the most frightening worries about raising a child with CP are misconceptions. Instead of fearing the worst, you should keep in mind that CP may not limit your child’s ability as much as you’d think. Try not to cater to any of the following fallacies:\nA Child With CP Can’t Succeed\nFor the vast majority of kids with CP, there’s no truth to this whatsoever. Less than half of the children with CP show intellectual impairment, so don’t make the mistake of giving your child limitations they may not actually have. A Child With CP Will Be Unable to Work\nA difficult situation should not turn into something impossible. If you help your child develop a skill or passion, their failure is far from guaranteed. As long as you keep an open and positive mind, whilst always encouraging and supporting your child, you may be surprised to see what they are capable of. A Child With CP Can’t Have a Normal Life\nFirstly, there is no such thing. Secondly, coming up with limitations and barriers for your child could turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy, so be patient and maintain a positive attitude. Your child’s future depends on having you in their corner. ” This article is a collaboration with a freelance writer and follows The Haitian Times publishing guidelines”","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ebe68948-380b-4167-ba10-e3246f84b471>"]},{"passage":"As parents of kids with CF, we can make a life-transforming difference by focusing as much on their mental health as we do on their physical health. If you think your child's CF is taking an emotional toll, asking yourself these questions may help. Lisa C. Greene, M.A., CFLE\nSeptember 29, 2015\nRegister Today to Learn More About the Latest in CF Research and Care\nYou Did It! EACT Passed in The House\nNot too long ago I had a conversation with an amazing dad who is concerned about his 15-year-old daughter. She has cystic fibrosis and it's taking a toll on her emotionally. She's been hospitalized a lot and is not doing well at school. He is afraid that she is giving up, and he needed ideas for how to turn it around. Certainly there are no easy answers here, but if you are the parent of a teen with CF and can relate to this dad's experience, here are some questions that may help. 1. First, is your child depressed? Working closely with your child's care team, you may consider taking your child to a professional who is experienced with working with people who have chronic illnesses. They can identify whether or not your teen is clinically depressed or if she is “simply” disheartened. People with chronic illnesses, such as CF, have a higher rate of depression and anxiety. Getting professional help early is the first line of defense. 2. What brings your child joy? Without having something to look forward to in life, people get tired of living. Sometimes it takes a little effort to figure out what brings your child joy. I worked with one mom whose 14-year-old son with CF was struggling emotionally. She knew that he loved animals, so this mom made arrangements at the local zoo for her son to volunteer periodically. This really helped give him something to look forward to and work toward as a possible career down the road. It gave him just enough hope and joy to get through some rough spots. 3. Are you purposeful about having fun and connecting as a family? With our own two kids who have CF, we have always made it a priority to have fun as a family. It's not always easy; we have to drag around a lot of medical equipment everywhere we go. But it's a priority for us, so we do what it takes. After medical clinic visits when our kids were little, we'd go to the zoo, a children's museum, a park or out to somewhere fun for lunch. We still go out after clinic when we can. When our daughter was hospitalized for several days, we “busted” her out of the hospital (with permission) to see the premiere of “The Hunger Games” with her friends. Everyday life affords many opportunities to make memories. Studies have shown that investing more time, energy and money in life experiences, i.e., \"having fun,\" makes you happier than buying \"stuff.\" I believe this approach has been a big part of our kids having a good attitude about cystic fibrosis, enjoying their lives and being connected as a family. Family traditions, time together, fun experiences … these are the things that lend a sense of hope and meaning, especially during the hard times. 4. Does your teen have a vision for his or her life? Sometimes when kids have a serious and progressive chronic illness like CF, they have a hard time seeing past the illness to a future. It's important that we encourage and empower our children to dream and plan. With many illnesses, including CF, there is so much hope for the future! 5. Can you connect your child with a good role model? Sometimes when a parent tries to encourage their teen directly, the child dismisses what their parent has to say with, “You don't understand. You're not the one with CF.” In these situations, it can really help to share positive, powerful role models who are as much like the child as possible. And by the way parents, what brings you joy? Are you taking good care of yourself, making sure you get your batteries recharged and having fun every now and then? Do you have a sense of purpose and meaning for your life (outside of living for your children)? Your positive example speaks more than words and lectures. Lisa C.

Cerebral Palsy Causes\nMost commonly, cerebral palsy develops in the fetus, but the condition can also develop during infancy or early childhood. The causes of CP are not always identifiable, but many cases can be linked to infection or exposure to radiation during pregnancy, fetal growth restriction or complications during labor. Birth asphyxia, seizures, respiratory problems and low blood sugar during or immediately after birth can also lead to CP. In very young children, cerebral palsy can be caused by lead poisoning, stroke, near drowning, encephalitis, meningitis, shaken baby syndrome or jaundice. Rarely, cases of CP are genetic. Cerebral Palsy Diagnosis\nCerebral palsy is usually initially diagnosed by a physical exam assessing general movements, especially in children 4 months of age or younger. Neuroimaging tests such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to determine the cause of CP, but are usually not necessary for a diagnosis. Cerebral Palsy Treatment\nTreatment of cerebral palsy focuses on maximizing independence for each individual with the disorder. Treatment of CP is a lifelong process that can include medication, therapy, surgery or a combination. Therapy can begin as soon as CP is diagnosed and may include physical therapy, speech therapy and therapy for social and emotional development. Medications can help improve muscle stiffness or pain, while braces can assist with walking and other movements. In some cases, orthopedic surgery can repair dislocated hips or abnormal spine curvature such as scoliosis. By focusing on a long-term vision of independence and quality of life from infancy through adulthood, our team of specialists can help infants, children and adolescents with cerebral palsy enjoy activities and hobbies that promote empowerment and enjoyment with as few limitations as possible. - CPATH – Central Texas support group for families & individuals living with cerebral palsy\n- Cerebral Palsy Research Registry\n- American Academy for Cerebral Palsy & Developmental Medicine\n- CP Daily Living\n- United Cerebral Palsy Resource Guide\n- The Cerebral Palsy International Research Foundation (CPIRF)\n- Let’s Cure CP","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:3412a23f-09ec-4a74-9b13-95114ec13975>"]},{"passage":"Influenced by theory and research on human attachment, loss, and caregiving (Bonanno & Kaltman, 1999; Bowlby, 1988; Pianta, Marvin, & Morog, 1999), this perspective emphasizes that when a child is born with special needs, parents have to let go of and grieve for their expectations and images of their anticipated or “hoped for” child (Moses, 1988). Developing a representation or schema of their child's actual, in contrast to their wished for, abilities facilitates parents' ability to respond sensitively to their child, thereby promoting a secure relationship with their child. At various levels of awareness, all potential parents have fantasies about their children and their child's future. These hopes and dreams intensify during pregnancy. Parents imagine the kind of person their child will become, the relationships they will have with him or her, and the pride and joy they will experience as a parent. We view these seemingly narcissistic and self-indulgent daydreams to be a normal part of the attachment process. They prepare parents to form attachments to the helpless and dependent newborn who will soon arrive. They help parents to make the long and difficult selfsacrifice and investment needed to raise children. However, high hopes and expectations may be a liability. They can be crushed when a child is born with a medical condition or disability. For many of these parents, a complicated process—similar to bereavement—begins (Emde & Brown, 1978). Some common parental experiences at the outset of this process are listed in Table 1. We believe that many parents and professionals are slow or fail to recognize this process of grieving and adaptation. One of the complications has been identifying for whom the parents are grieving. Physically, their baby is not lost; he or she is right there with them. Instead, these parents are grieving for their hoped for child—the child they were expecting who never arrived (Moses, 1988). Parents have to adjust their expectations and hopes for their child in the face of the substantial uncertainties inherent in their child's medical, motor, intellectual, and social prognosis. Emotionally and cognitively, parents must come to terms with their child's condition. Pianta, Marvin, and colleagues (Marvin & Pianta, 1996; Pianta et al., 1999; Pianta, Marvin, Britner, & Borowitz, 1996) have examined parental reactions and developed a technique for assessing parents' state of mind regarding their child's diagnosis. On the basis of their responses to a brief, semistructured interview, parents are rated on the degree to which they have resolved their thoughts and feelings about their child's condition. In Pianta and Marvin's scheme, parental resolution is marked by an integration of the facts and realities associated with their child's condition along with emotional reactions to the diagnosis. This integration is present in both their mental images of their child and their relationship with him or her. Indices of resolved and unresolved reactions are presented in Table 2. Like grief and mourning (Bowlby, 1980), parental reactions to diagnosis are thought to be determined by a complex set of processes related to personality, relationship history, and how one has learned to process information about emotions and relationships. Mothers' resolution of their child's diagnosis has been found to be significantly associated with a variety of measures of parent and family functioning including maternal mental health, perceived social support, and husbands' ratings of the marital relationship (Sheeran, Marvin, & Pianta, 1997). Notably, lack of maternal resolution of child diagnosis has been shown to be strongly associated with the formation of an insecure attachment in the diagnosed child (Barnett et al., 1999; Marvin & Pianta, 1996; Pianta et al., 1999). From this research, we have hypothesized that parents who are unresolved regarding their child's diagnosis have difficulty responding sensitively to their child. We believe that until parents have achieved a balanced view of their child, they will have difficulty accurately reading their child's signals and providing their child with a secure base from which to explore new relationships, learn to trust others, develop social skills, and feel lovable and efficacious. THE ADAPTATION PROCESS\nAlthough researchers and clinicians use the terms resolution and acceptance, we have chosen to emphasize the term adaptation when we work directly with parents.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:b9b0feec-c823-4aeb-8b62-892bbab6fd78>"]},{"passage":"How to recognize and refer children with hemiplegic (unilateral) cerebral palsy\nWhat is cerebral palsy? Cerebral palsy, or CP, refers to a group of developmental conditions that have several features in common. All are caused by some kind of injury to the developing brain. The injury can occur in the womb, during the birth of the baby, or in the first couple of years after birth. Common risk factors for CP include prematurity, low birth weight, multiple gestation, and infection.1\nindividuals in Canada are diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy (CP)\nIn Canada CP affects 1 in every 400 individuals and is the most common physical disability in children. The hallmark disability for individuals with CP is related to motor function – how a person develops and maintains control of their movement. Children with CP almost always have issues with whole-body movement, including walking, and often in using their hands and arms. In addition, they may also have other challenges resulting from their brain injury, including problems with seizures, learning, communicating, vision and hearing, and behaviour. What is hemiplegic or unilateral CP? of children diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy have hemiplegic CP. ‘Hemiplegia’, ‘hemiparesis’, or ‘unilateral’ CP affects the movement and muscle tone on one side of the body, although often the other side of the body may be affected to a lesser extent.2 It is the most common form of CP, with estimates ranging from 33-39% of all people with CP.3,4 A ‘stroke’ in the time before, during or after birth is the most common cause of hemiplegic CP. Multiple factors may interact to block the blood vessels in the brain and cause a stroke. Many times the cause of the stroke will never be known.5 As one side of the brain is injured, the opposite side of the body is affected; this can result in weakness of an arm, leg, or both on one side of the body. Sixty percent of children with hemiplegic CP have seizures in the newborn period. What are the early signs of hemiplegic CP? Hemiplegic CP frequently presents in the first year of life when parents notice a hand preference, which is very unusual in children at this age. Other signs include fisting of one hand and flexion (bending) of the elbow on the affected side. In supported standing, the child may stand flatfooted on their more functional side and up on the toes of the hemiplegic side. Likewise, the child may not bear weight well through the affected hand or foot. Some asymmetry in function might be noted when the child is crawling or attempting other motor activities and as a result the child’s crawling is often delayed. For children under the age of 18 months, some ‘red flags’ include:\n- Favouring one hand, leaving the other hand in a fist or reaching across their body to grab objects, or not bringing both hands together during play\n- Delays in early motor milestones – rolling, sitting, pulling to stand, crawling, and walking\n- Stiffness or weakness in muscles on one side of the body\n- Difficulty with the early development of walking and balance\n- Asymmetrical movement and posture\nHow is hemiplegic CP diagnosed? Hemiplegia is a condition best recognized by the story the parents tell and the observations we make when watching children in action. An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) brain scan is the preferred method of neuroimaging for CP.3 MRI is useful for identifying the presence and location of a brain injury in almost 90% of children with CP.6 Children with hemiplegia commonly have abnormal cranial ultrasounds. What is the outlook for children with hemiplegic CP? The gross motor function of 88% of children with hemiplegia is classified as GMFCS level 1.7\nThis means that almost all children with hemiplegia can walk by 2 years of age without assistive devices, and by age 6 can:\n- Walk long distances outdoors and on uneven surfaces\n- Move from the floor or a chair to standing without using their hands for support\n- Go up and down stairs without needing to hold the handrail\n- Are beginning to run and jump. Some potential challenges include:\n- Difficulties with voluntary movement in one arm, for instance difficulty opening their hand, picking up small objects, turning the hand over. In the leg, there may be toe walking on the one side which can cause tripping.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:fd2aec53-fe01-4906-9aec-e8d0689af4ef>"]},{"passage":"No one can relate to what I go through.

As a homework assignment, parents are asked to write a letter to, or draw a picture of their hoped for child. Although their letters and pictures are not shared with their child, they are asked to reflect on the hopes and dreams they had for their child before learning of their child's medical diagnosis. Sessions 4 and 5: Giving ourselves time\nThe goals of these sessions are to help parents accept their reactions to their child, develop realistic expectations of themselves, and identify the challenges that lie ahead. Understandably, many parents try to deny or avoid their negative reactions to their child and their child's condition. They may feel pressure to “get over” it. They may feel a lack of empathy from others. We believe efforts to avoid, minimize, or hurry negative feelings interferes with the adaptation process. Consequently, we work to normalize parents' reactions and distress, encouraging them to explore rather than avoid these feelings. The facilitator reviews the stages included in the book Nobody's Perfect: surviving, searching, settling in, and separating. As previously mentioned, the “stages” in the process of adapting to a disability diagnosis are not necessarily sequential, often overlap, repeat, and do not imply closure or completion. We help parents to realize that adaptation is a lifelong process and to identify important emotional milestones that accompany their struggle to build new dreams for their child. Catalysts for movement from one stage to another as well as stage overlap and repetition are discussed. The book is also used to help parents identify their strengths and abilities and to learn additional ways to handle difficult times. Parents are invited to share the ways that they have worked through or handled the challenges of each stage. Chapter 7 of Miller's book, entitled “Taking care of you,” is used to emphasize the importance of parents attending to their own needs. Session 6: Slowly rebuilding new dreams\nThe goal of this session is to encourage parents to take new steps in adapting to their child. In this session, parents reflect on their journey up to this point, and they identify their strengths. They consider what their families have done well and the benefits of those experiences. Participants share stories of hope and progress. In the context of reminders of the unfolding nature of their child's development and personality, parents begin to explore new dreams for their child and for themselves as parents. Parents are asked to participate in an art activity in which the instructions are to create 2 pictures\/symbols: the first depicting their surroundings and their mood immediately after learning of their child's disability and the second depicting their current mood and surroundings. Parents are then asked to reflect on what has changed since they first learned of their child's disability. Session 7: Relating to others\nThe goal of this session is to provide information to boost coping strategies and improve the parents' relationships with family and friends. This session addresses concerns regarding the impact of the child's special needs on the parent and on spousal, sibling, and extended family relationships. Stress, conflict resolution, prioritizing, and other common challenges to relationships within the family are considered. Different ways of responding to and coping with stress are described. Particular attention is given to improving communication and reducing stress in the relationships between mothers and fathers. We encourage mothers and fathers to attend, but in many cases this is not possible. We encourage a group dialogue about stepparents and situations where parents are and are not living together. To clarify differences in how mothers and fathers respond to having a child with a medical condition or disability, group members are asked to read excerpts from Donald Meyer's book Uncommon Fathers: Reflections on Raising a Child With a Disability (Meyer, 1995). Group members offer examples and suggestions for meeting various challenges so that they can maintain satisfying, mutually supportive relationships with family members. Session 8: Relating to my child\nThe goal of this session is to encourage and reinforce sensitive parenting and to acknowledge the formal ending of the group curriculum. In this session, the significance of parental behavior and emotional reactions to the child's developing sense of trust and security are explored. Group leaders discuss how physical closeness and touch communicate comfort and security to children.

ABSTRACT Tobacco smoking increases the risk of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) and back pain, but the mechanisms underlying the adverse effects of smoking are largely unknown. Current hypotheses predict that smoking contributes to IDD indirectly through nicotine-mediated vasoconstriction which limits the exchange of nutrients between the discs and their surroundings. We alternatively hypothesize that direct contact of disc cells, that is, cells in the outermost annulus and those present along fissures in degenerating discs, with the vascular system containing soluble tobacco smoking constituents could perturb normal metabolic activities resulting in IDD. In this study, we tested our hypothesis by comparing the effects of direct exposure of human disc cells to tobacco smoke condensate and nicotine on cell viability and metabolic activity. We showed that smoke condensate, which contains all of the water-soluble compounds inhaled by smokers, exerts greater detrimental effects on human disc cell viability and metabolism than nicotine. Smoke condensate greatly induced an inflammatory response and gene expression of metalloproteinases while reduced active matrix synthesis and expression of matrix structural genes. Therefore, we have demonstrated that disc cell exposure to the constituents of tobacco smoke has negative consequences which have the potential to alter disc matrix homeostasis. - SourceAvailable from: PubMed Central[Show abstract] [Hide abstract]\nABSTRACT: The purpose of the present study was to simultaneously examine the transcript levels of a large number of interleukins (ILs; IL-9, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-16, IL-17, IL-18, IL-26, and IL-27) and investigate their correlation with the clinicopathological profiles of patients with tuberculous intervertebral discs.PLoS ONE 01\/2014; 9(6):e101324. · 3.53 Impact Factor\n- [Show abstract] [Hide abstract]\nABSTRACT: Cigarette smoking has deleterious effects on the musculo-skeletal system. The loss of bone mineral content and increased incidence of fractures are the best known negative consequences. The pathogenesis is complex, due to direct toxic effects on osteoblasts\/osteoclasts activity of nicotine, and indirect actions on sex and adrenocortical hormones, vitamin D, intestinal calcium absorption, vessels and oxygen supply. Smoking may favour the onset or aggravate the progression of rheumatoid arthritis and back pain. Negative influences have been observed on muscle and on tendons. Moreover, smoking habit is associated to a number of short term post-operative complications and higher resource consumption. Smoking cessation is highly advisable with positive effects on the bone metabolism on the long term. More positive and immediate results can be obtained in patients submitted to orthopedic surgery: the healing process is improved, the frequency of complications is reduced, and the length of hospital stay is shortened.Muscles, ligaments and tendons journal. 04\/2013; 3(2):63-9. - [Show abstract] [Hide abstract]\nABSTRACT: Abstract Intervertebral discs comprise the largest avascular cartilaginous organ in the body, and its nutrient condition can be impaired by degeneration, aging, and even metabolic disease. The unique microenvironment brings special stresses to various disc cell types, including nucleus pulposus cells, notochordal cells, annulus fibrosus cells, and endplate chondrocytes. These cells experience nutrient starvation, acidic stress, hypoxic stress, hyperglycemic stress, osmotic stress, and mechanical stress. Understanding the detailed responses and complex adaptive mechanisms of disc cells to various stresses might provide some clues to guide therapy for disc degeneration. By reviewing the published literatures describing disc cells under different hostile microenvironments, we conclude that these cells exhibit different responses to microenvironmental stresses with different mechanisms. Moreover, the interaction and combination of these stresses create a complex environment that synergistically increase or decrease influences on disc cells, compared with the effects of a single stress.\n\nFacts About Tobacco Consumption\nTobacco contains nicotine, which was named after a plant called Nicotania tabacum, which was named after a French guy Nicot de Villemain. During 16th century, he planted the plant in Paris and promoted it. This alkaloid is almost 3% of tobacco’s dry weight and it mostly contains leaves and roots. But smaller amount of it found in other plants like potatoes, tomatoes, eggplants, leaves of coca plants and green peppers. Did you know that in the late 17th century, nicotine was used as pesticides? Yes, it is true! The antihervivore effect of nicotine can be very lethal, especially to insects. Likewise, Nicotine sulfate was also considered to be the most potent botanical insecticide that was available for home gardeners as it was very harmful to humans and was quickly absorbed through the skin. That is why, in 2008, the United States of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) banned the use of nicotine-based pesticides. Effects About tobacco Consumption\nIn higher doses, between 30 to 60 mg, nicotine can be very lethal to humans and deterrent to insects, making it neurotoxic chemical. However, in smaller doses, 1mg or smaller present in cigarette, it acts as a stimulant. In smaller doses, nicotine will not affect the health of the human beings. But in higher doses, it is very harmful to the health of the human beings. There are many side effects due to the tobacco consumption. - Affects nervous system\nNicotine mostly affects your nervous system and helps reduce your appetite, relieves depression, boosts mood, improves memory and cognition, and enhances train activity. However, it also increases salivation, stimulates intestinal motility, increases both the blood pressure and heart rate, and may even cause vomiting and nausea. - Nicotine Addiction\nAlthough it takes only 1mg of nicotine in one cigarette to stimulate your brain, however, this single stick would be sufficient enough to cause you addiction to it too. Your brain is responsible in creating neurotransmitters, which thus creates emotions and sensations you feel within you. But when you inhale nicotine, it masks those neurotransmitters, thus deceiving neurons and replacing the substance called acetylcholine on its receptors. The nicotine then goes on to produce an abnormal amount of dopamine, causing euphoria. After smoking, the euphoria ceases because the nicotine effect has gone. Thus, when this feel-good sensation is gone, you might be attempted to have that feeling again. That is why, most people need another cigarette to revive that euphoria. This cycle continues, and then eventually, the addiction increases. - Chronic Withdrawal Symptoms\nSometimes, smokers may also want to quit smoking, and while doing so, they may experience mild to chronic withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, intense craving for nicotine, depression, trouble sleeping, drowsiness, headaches, frustration, inability to concentrate, and weight loss. These symptoms will be at its highest for at least 2-3 days after you’ve stopped smoking. The withdrawal symptoms may be even more frequent among people who used to smoke more sticks per day or who had longer years or smoking. But nicotine addicts are trying to avoid these same symptoms, and thus, they prolong their recovery and addiction to nicotine. There are number of diagnostics available today to detect nicotine in your body. When you inhale smoke, nicotine is metabolized into cotinine in vital organs such as the liver and lungs, which then is eventually expelled through the urine. Apart from nicotine, cotinine is a good indicator for nicotine use, detectable in saliva, urine, and the blood. - Length Of Time Nicotine Stay In The Bod\nIt depends on the number of tobacco you smoke every day, and the number of years you’ve smoked till today, and also the type of nicotine test done. In short, it may be 2 days, or it may stay as long as 3 months. - Nicotine Blood Test\nTo detect nicotine use, both quantitative and qualitative blood tests can be used. The presence, or the absence, or the blood nicotine levels can be figured out.\n\nThe Discs of the Spine: An Overview\nThe bones of the spine are separated by tough cartilage pads called intervertebral discs (inter = “between”; vertebral = “bones of the spine”). Healthy discs are thick and flexible (like a wet sponge) allowing a wide range of bending and twisting motions. An unhealthy disc is stiff and hard (like a dry sponge) and prone to injuries such as bulging or herniation. Over time gravity, spinal joint dysfunction and accumulated trauma cause the discs to compress, flatten and degenerate. This constant compression prevents much-needed oxygen and nutrients from entering the disc. This ongoing starvation causes the once-tough outer layers of the disc to soften allowing the disc to become injured or diseased. Disc damage can occur anywhere in the spine. However, the discs of the neck (cervical spine) and low back (lumbar spine) are the most commonly injured. |Disc Bulge (A)||Herniated Disc (B)||Disk Rupture (C)|\nDisease of the spinal discs can take many forms. Significant disc damage can lead to a Disc Bulge, become a tear called a Disc Herniation or the inner gelatinous material of the disc can leak out in the case of a Ruptured Disc. The “jelly center” of the disc can also dry out over time which is referred to as Degenerative Disc Disease. All forms of disc injury can eventually impinge on the nerves exiting the spine (“Pinched Nerve”) which can create numbness, tingling, burning or sharp pain down the arms or legs. Sharp pain originating from the back and “shooting” down the legs is often referred to as Sciatica. Introduction to Degenerative Disc Disease\nIn order to understand the condition of Degenerative Disc Disease one must know two main facts about discs:\n- Spinal discs do NOT have a direct blood supply. There are no arteries that feed the disc with oxygen and nutrients. Therefore, discs of the spine must receive their oxygen and nutrients from a different source. Normal, healthy discs are “fed” and oxygenated by the constant recycling of the disc fluid that occurs with spinal joint movement. This joint motion “sucks” in fluid filled with oxygen and nutrients and “pumps out” waste fluid. This process of fluid diffusion is greatly affected by internal disc pressure (intradiscal pressure) which brings us to key point #2:\n- The discs of the spine are under constant pressure. The spinal discs are designed to absorb shock and maintain spinal flexibility by acting as cushions during body movement. The discs act similar to shock absorbers in a car. Car shock absorbers maintain a constant pressure to “push back” against the weight and movement of the car. Spinal discs act in a similar fashion. The pressure within the discs pushes the bones of the spine apart preventing them from crashing into one another during activities like running and jumping. Unfortunately, this constant internal disc pressure also pushes the fluid out of the disc consistently every day. This makes it difficult for the body to “suck” in new, healthy disc fluid with its much-needed oxygen and nutrients. These two factors make it difficult for the body to maintain thick, plump, healthy discs making Degenerative Disc Disease one of the more common spinal ailments. |Degenerative Disc Disease: As the disc degenerates it loses height (Disc Height Reduction) allowing the bones above and below to “sandwich” the nerve between them.|\nDegenerative Disc Disease, as the name implies, is caused by the progressive degeneration of the intervertebral disc. Nearly every physical activity (no matter how simple) places strain upon these discs. Over time, repeated daily stress and minor traumas begin to weaken the discs of the spine. This process of accumulated wear and tear will eventually lead to disc degeneration commonly referred to as Degenerative Disc Disease. The process of disc degeneration often begins with a chronic lack of oxygen and nutrients. This can occur because of 1) greater than normal compression of the disc or 2) as a result of decreased hydration.\n\n- Lumbar disc herniation is a common cause of lower back pain and can result from age-related degeneration, physical trauma, genetic predisposition, or lifestyle factors. - Symptoms include lower back pain, sciatica, and numbness or tingling in the legs. - Treatment options range from conservative approaches like rest, medication, and physical therapy to alternative treatments like chiropractic care and acupuncture. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary. - Prevention strategies include regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, proper lifting techniques, and good posture. - A comprehensive, customized treatment plan can help individuals overcome lumbar disc herniation and return to their favorite activities pain-free. Anatomy and Physiology\nOur spine is a fascinating and complex structure that plays a crucial role in supporting our bodies and allowing us to move freely. To better understand how injuries to the discs occur, it's essential first to understand the anatomy and physiology of the spine. Structure of the Spine\nOur spine is made up of 33 vertebrae stacked on top of each other. These vertebrae are separated by intervertebral discs, which act as shock absorbers and provide flexibility to the spine. The vertebrae are the individual bones that make up the spine. They are divided into different regions: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal. Each vertebra is a uniquely shaped bone that provides support and stability to the spine. The vertebrae are connected by facet joints, allowing smooth and controlled movements. The vertebral column also serves as the protective canal for the spinal cord, which transmits signals between the brain and the rest of the body. Intervertebral discs are the spongy, cartilaginous pads found between the vertebrae. They are composed of an outer fibrous ring called the annulus fibrosus and an inner gel-like substance called the nucleus pulposus. Functions of the Intervertebral Discs\nIntervertebral discs play two primary roles in the overall function and health of the spine:\nOne of the primary functions of the intervertebral discs is to act as a shock absorber for the spine during everyday activities. This shock-absorbing capacity helps protect the vertebrae and prevent injuries. However, the discs can wear down over time, making them less effective at absorbing shock. This wear and tear can increase the risk of conditions like lumbar disc herniation. What Is A Lumbar Disc Herniation? A lumbar disc herniation occurs when the outer layer of an intervertebral disc tears, allowing the soft inner material to bulge or leak out. This can cause nerve compression and pain, numbness, or weakness. Here are the common causes:\nAs we age, the intervertebral discs lose some water content and become less flexible. This process, known as disc degeneration, can make the discs more susceptible to tearing and herniation. Age-related degeneration is a common cause of lumbar disc herniation, highlighting the significance of preserving a healthy spine throughout one's life. Physical Trauma or Injury\nSudden physical trauma or injury, such as a fall, a car accident, or a sports injury, can cause damage to the intervertebral discs and lead to lumbar disc herniation. In these cases, prompt treatment is crucial to minimize long-term damage and prevent chronic pain. Some individuals may have a genetic predisposition to lumbar disc herniation, and research has found several inherited factors that affect intervertebral disc structure and strength. While you cannot change your genetics, understanding your family history can help you take proactive measures to protect your spine and reduce the risk of herniation. Several lifestyle factors can contribute to lumbar disc herniation, including:\nA sedentary lifestyle can weaken the muscles that support the spine. That lack of stabilizer strength increases pressure on the intervertebral discs, resulting in a higher risk of herniation. Physical activity and targeted exercises can help maintain a strong and healthy spine. Poor posture can place additional stress on the intervertebral discs and increase the risk of herniation. It can be static (think sitting or standing) or dynamic (think how you lift things). Excess body weight can put extra pressure on the intervertebral discs, making them more prone to damage and herniation.\n\n- We strive to provide complete care for our patients. Learn more about all the services we provide. Your Spine 101\nAn adult human spine typically consists of 26 moveable segments: seven cervical vertebras, twelve thoracic vertebras, five lumbar vertebras, one sacrum, and one coccyx (tailbone). Intervertebral discs separate the segments from the second cervical vertebra down to the sacrum and a thinner disc is present between the sacrum and coccyx. Intervertebral discs comprise about 25% of the height of an adult spine. Intervertebral joints connect vertebras and these joints are lined by lubricating synovial membranes. All of these structures are designed and built to last a lifetime. Intervertebral discs, which are gel-like colloids, begin to lose their water content at about age 2. This slow resorption is perfectly normal. Nothing lasts forever, and all living structures degrade and deteriorate over time. With this in mind, we can understand how it is that x-rays of older persons show various degrees of degeneration or arthritis of the spinal joints and intervertebral discs. These physiological changes are ominously or portentously referred to as \"degenerative disc disease\" by certain specialists, but it is important to remember that these structures deteriorate naturally. Degeneration or breakdown of spinal joints and intervertebral discs is not a disease, but rather a standard process that occurs over time, more rapidly in some persons than in others. There are measures we can employ to resist the effects of spinal degenerative changes and possibly even slow the process of degeneration itself. Spinal degenerative changes are problematic as they result in loss of resilience, flexibility, and mobility of the spine as a whole. The overall result is degradation of spinal function and increased possibility for strains, sprains, and other injuries. Solutions are available, as research studies have consistently demonstrated that regular vigorous exercise and healthy nutrition provide significant benefit in maintaining spinal structure and function. Regular vigorous exercise such as walking, running, bike riding, and strength training provide consistent weight bearing stress to spinal joints and intervertebral discs. Such mechanical stresses are required for these structures to retain their physiological integrity. For example, exercise pumps fluid back into intervertebral discs and increases lubrication of spinal joints. Healthy eating provides the nutrients required to support efficient repair and replacement of the cells and tissues of spinal structural components. Thus, by choosing to implement healthy lifestyles, we help keep our spines in peak physical condition and become better able to withstand the negative effects of natural physiological forces occurring over time. Having a healthy spine also depends on getting regular chiropractic care. Exercise, good nutrition, and sufficient rest are the primary requirements for spinal health, but there may be limitations and restrictions in the form of spinal joint dysfunction and nerve interference. These limitations prevent your spine from achieving optimal function and may lead to stiffness, loss of mobility, ongoing pain, and even injury. By detecting and correcting spinal joint dysfunction, regular chiropractic care helps eliminate sources of nerve interference and enables your spine to do its job, which includes handling heavy mechanical loads and moving you around during all your activities throughout the day. Regular chiropractic care partners with your other healthy lifestyle choices to help you achieve high levels of health and well-being now and into the future. - Geusens PP, van den Bergh JP: Osteoporosis and osteoarthritis: shared mechanisms and epidemiology.

Everybody understands the dangers associated with cigarette use but is nicotine by itself dangerous? How much nicotine do cigarettes exactly contain? Moreover, does nicotine occur naturally in tobacco or are the tobacco companies responsible for adding it? Where does the nicotine found in e-liquids come from? What is Nicotine and What Are Its Origins? Let us begin with the simpler question: Does nicotine occur naturally in tobacco? Nicotine is definitely an alkaloid present in tobacco and various other members of the nightshade family including peppers, tomatoes, potatoes, and eggplant. You can rightly state that humanity has been consumers of nicotine for millennia since tobacco cultivation started in the Americas about 6,000 B.C. Back then people most likely smoked or chewed it. Even Christophe Columbus himself actually received a gift of dried tobacco once he arrived in the Bahamas. He even carried tobacco seeds and leaves with him back to Europe. The Evolution of Nicotine\nNicot de Villemain, who was the French diplomat responsible for the introduction of tobacco to the Queen of France who then used it for treating her headaches was whom nicotine was named in honor of. You might not believe it but tobacco was at a time believed to have medicinal qualities. However, as early as the 17th Century, doctors had started discovering a correlation between the use of tobacco and diseases like cancer. Over 25 million pounds of tobacco were being cultivated annually around the same time in the Jamestown colony alone, thus making it a top export of the American colonies. It is worth noting that consuming nicotine alone is not believed to be the root of health problems related to smoking. Tobacco and even cigarettes themselves contain other chemicals that are known to be carcinogenic. Nicotine was once believed to be the key driver of dependency on tobacco but new evidence suggests that those other chemicals actually play a greater role in cigarette addiction. Interestingly, recent studies have revealed that nicotine by itself might actually possess some medicinal properties. Researchers from all over the world are successfully experimenting with using nicotine for treating Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s, and even depression. The Use of Nicotine Today\nA large number of people still consume nicotine from various tobacco products including cigars, cigarettes, or even chewing tobacco. Nicotine is obviously found in some e-liquids and nicotine patches. The nicotine used in nicotine replacement therapies is actually extracted from tobacco but it is sometimes manufactured artificially. The theory behind nicotine replacement is that it works by mitigating the withdrawal effects of tobacco. We currently understand that addiction to cigarettes has several different facets, which is the reason why the development of e-cigarettes happened: to mimic closely the smoking process but without the associated health risks. If you are thinking of adopting vaping to replace traditional smoking, you should first determine if you would like an e-liquid containing nicotine or not. Some smokers may find themselves not requiring the nicotine since they are able to satisfy their urges through the act of vaping. If you do prefer taking the nicotine route, you need to choose a nicotine strength that depends on the number of cigarettes that you currently smoke on a daily basis. You need to understand that the effects of nicotine usually differ depending on the method of delivery that you use. For instance, research shows that people that vape usually take in lower amounts of nicotine per puff than traditional smokers. In part 2 of the series, we will be focusing on how much nicotine is contained in cigarettes and reveal the amount of nicotine that smokers consume.\n\nWhat is disc herniation? Composed of bone and intervertebral discs, the spine plays a major role in supporting and bearing the weight of the body. By giving a cushioning effect, the intervertebral discs allow us to achieve a certain degree of body flexion. As modern people often bow their heads to look down on their mobile phones and bend their spines incorrectly, the intervertebral discs in the neck and waist are often stressed, which make disc herniation an even more common problem nowadays. Intervertebral discs are in fact surrounded by fibrous tissues. In the centre of the discs is a jelly-like substance called nucleus pulposus, which is tightly wrapped and protected by the annulus. When the tissues have been stressed for a prolonged period, aged or strained, the annulus may tear. Then when the gel is squeezed out, the problem of disc herniation will result. The protruding discs may be pressed to the surrounding nerves, causing sciatica, which often comes with pain, tingling sensation, numbness or weakness.\n\nHelen W, Merry CL, Blaker JJ, Gough JE (2007) Threedimensional culture of annulus fibrosus cells within PDLLA\/Bioglass composite foam scaffolds: assessment of cell attachment, proliferation and extracellular matrix production.

Just how far the negative health effects of cigarettes reach, however, may come as a surprise to many. A new study from Emory University has linked smoking cigarettes with degenerative disc disease in the cervical spine, a condition which can cause chronic neck pain. The cervical spine is located in the neck and is comprised of vertebrae, as well as cervical discs, which sit between the vertebrae and absorb shock to the spine. As people get older, these discs dehydrate and shrink, which can cause chronic pain to develop. \"Smoking is not healthy for a person’s intervertebral discs given the risk of developing microvascular disease — a disease of the small blood vessels — due to nicotine abuse,\" said lead investigator Mitchel Leavitt, MD, in a press release. Dr. Leavitt is a resident doctor in Emory’s Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. Intervertebral discs get their nourishment from the microvasculature system, a small system of blood vessels that line either side of the discs. Nicotine can damage these blood vessels, causing the discs to receive improper nourishment and degenerate faster. Although past research has linked smoking to disc degeneration in the lumbar spine (near the base of the spine), none have linked smoking with degeneration in the cervical spine. This study looked at the CT scans of 182 patients who were scanned for various reasons, more than half of whom were women and 34 percent of whom were smokers. Researchers asked a radiologist with training in neuroradiology and a physiatrist to review these scans. Each disc was rated on a scale between 0 and 3 (as normal, mild, moderate or severe) depending on how much it had degenerated. A cumulative score between 0 and 15 was then given for the entire cervical spine. Dr. Leavitt and team also looked at how often patients smoked and for how long, and then adjusted for health factors such as age, body mass index, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. On average, current smokers were more likely to have cervical degenerative disc disease. Age made the disease worse, but coexisting conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high BMI did not. \"This is another example of the detrimental effects of smoking,\" Dr. Leavitt said. \"Pain and spine clinics are filled with patients who suffer chronic neck and back pain, and this study provides the physician with more ammunition to use when educating them about their need to quit smoking.\" The study was presented Feb. 18 at the Association of Academic Physiatrists' Annual Meeting in Sacramento, CA.

ABSTRACT Tobacco smoking increases the risk of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) and back pain, but the mechanisms underlying the adverse effects of smoking are largely unknown. Current hypotheses predict that smoking contributes to IDD indirectly through nicotine-mediated vasoconstriction which limits the exchange of nutrients between the discs and their surroundings. We alternatively hypothesize that direct contact of disc cells, that is, cells in the outermost annulus and those present along fissures in degenerating discs, with the vascular system containing soluble tobacco smoking constituents could perturb normal metabolic activities resulting in IDD. In this study, we tested our hypothesis by comparing the effects of direct exposure of human disc cells to tobacco smoke condensate and nicotine on cell viability and metabolic activity. We showed that smoke condensate, which contains all of the water-soluble compounds inhaled by smokers, exerts greater detrimental effects on human disc cell viability and metabolism than nicotine. Smoke condensate greatly induced an inflammatory response and gene expression of metalloproteinases while reduced active matrix synthesis and expression of matrix structural genes. Therefore, we have demonstrated that disc cell exposure to the constituents of tobacco smoke has negative consequences which have the potential to alter disc matrix homeostasis. - SourceAvailable from: PubMed Central[Show abstract] [Hide abstract]\nABSTRACT: The purpose of the present study was to simultaneously examine the transcript levels of a large number of interleukins (ILs; IL-9, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-16, IL-17, IL-18, IL-26, and IL-27) and investigate their correlation with the clinicopathological profiles of patients with tuberculous intervertebral discs.PLoS ONE 01\/2014; 9(6):e101324. · 3.53 Impact Factor\n- [Show abstract] [Hide abstract]\nABSTRACT: Cigarette smoking has deleterious effects on the musculo-skeletal system.

The unique microenvironment brings special stresses to various disc cell types, including nucleus pulposus cells, notochordal cells, annulus fibrosus cells, and endplate chondrocytes. These cells experience nutrient starvation, acidic stress, hypoxic stress, hyperglycemic stress, osmotic stress, and mechanical stress. Understanding the detailed responses and complex adaptive mechanisms of disc cells to various stresses might provide some clues to guide therapy for disc degeneration. By reviewing the published literatures describing disc cells under different hostile microenvironments, we conclude that these cells exhibit different responses to microenvironmental stresses with different mechanisms. Moreover, the interaction and combination of these stresses create a complex environment that synergistically increase or decrease influences on disc cells, compared with the effects of a single stress.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:bafe38fc-6bf3-468e-94be-7ebd726b62ad>"]},{"passage":"Facts About Tobacco Consumption\nTobacco contains nicotine, which was named after a plant called Nicotania tabacum, which was named after a French guy Nicot de Villemain. During 16th century, he planted the plant in Paris and promoted it. This alkaloid is almost 3% of tobacco’s dry weight and it mostly contains leaves and roots. But smaller amount of it found in other plants like potatoes, tomatoes, eggplants, leaves of coca plants and green peppers. Did you know that in the late 17th century, nicotine was used as pesticides? Yes, it is true! The antihervivore effect of nicotine can be very lethal, especially to insects. Likewise, Nicotine sulfate was also considered to be the most potent botanical insecticide that was available for home gardeners as it was very harmful to humans and was quickly absorbed through the skin. That is why, in 2008, the United States of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) banned the use of nicotine-based pesticides. Effects About tobacco Consumption\nIn higher doses, between 30 to 60 mg, nicotine can be very lethal to humans and deterrent to insects, making it neurotoxic chemical. However, in smaller doses, 1mg or smaller present in cigarette, it acts as a stimulant. In smaller doses, nicotine will not affect the health of the human beings. But in higher doses, it is very harmful to the health of the human beings. There are many side effects due to the tobacco consumption. - Affects nervous system\nNicotine mostly affects your nervous system and helps reduce your appetite, relieves depression, boosts mood, improves memory and cognition, and enhances train activity. However, it also increases salivation, stimulates intestinal motility, increases both the blood pressure and heart rate, and may even cause vomiting and nausea. - Nicotine Addiction\nAlthough it takes only 1mg of nicotine in one cigarette to stimulate your brain, however, this single stick would be sufficient enough to cause you addiction to it too. Your brain is responsible in creating neurotransmitters, which thus creates emotions and sensations you feel within you. But when you inhale nicotine, it masks those neurotransmitters, thus deceiving neurons and replacing the substance called acetylcholine on its receptors. The nicotine then goes on to produce an abnormal amount of dopamine, causing euphoria. After smoking, the euphoria ceases because the nicotine effect has gone. Thus, when this feel-good sensation is gone, you might be attempted to have that feeling again. That is why, most people need another cigarette to revive that euphoria. This cycle continues, and then eventually, the addiction increases. - Chronic Withdrawal Symptoms\nSometimes, smokers may also want to quit smoking, and while doing so, they may experience mild to chronic withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, intense craving for nicotine, depression, trouble sleeping, drowsiness, headaches, frustration, inability to concentrate, and weight loss. These symptoms will be at its highest for at least 2-3 days after you’ve stopped smoking. The withdrawal symptoms may be even more frequent among people who used to smoke more sticks per day or who had longer years or smoking. But nicotine addicts are trying to avoid these same symptoms, and thus, they prolong their recovery and addiction to nicotine. There are number of diagnostics available today to detect nicotine in your body. When you inhale smoke, nicotine is metabolized into cotinine in vital organs such as the liver and lungs, which then is eventually expelled through the urine. Apart from nicotine, cotinine is a good indicator for nicotine use, detectable in saliva, urine, and the blood. - Length Of Time Nicotine Stay In The Bod\nIt depends on the number of tobacco you smoke every day, and the number of years you’ve smoked till today, and also the type of nicotine test done. In short, it may be 2 days, or it may stay as long as 3 months. - Nicotine Blood Test\nTo detect nicotine use, both quantitative and qualitative blood tests can be used. The presence, or the absence, or the blood nicotine levels can be figured out.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:5d90f364-0e12-4570-af17-d6e8974bc88f>"]},{"passage":"The Discs of the Spine: An Overview\nThe bones of the spine are separated by tough cartilage pads called intervertebral discs (inter = “between”; vertebral = “bones of the spine”). Healthy discs are thick and flexible (like a wet sponge) allowing a wide range of bending and twisting motions. An unhealthy disc is stiff and hard (like a dry sponge) and prone to injuries such as bulging or herniation. Over time gravity, spinal joint dysfunction and accumulated trauma cause the discs to compress, flatten and degenerate. This constant compression prevents much-needed oxygen and nutrients from entering the disc. This ongoing starvation causes the once-tough outer layers of the disc to soften allowing the disc to become injured or diseased. Disc damage can occur anywhere in the spine. However, the discs of the neck (cervical spine) and low back (lumbar spine) are the most commonly injured. |Disc Bulge (A)||Herniated Disc (B)||Disk Rupture (C)|\nDisease of the spinal discs can take many forms. Significant disc damage can lead to a Disc Bulge, become a tear called a Disc Herniation or the inner gelatinous material of the disc can leak out in the case of a Ruptured Disc. The “jelly center” of the disc can also dry out over time which is referred to as Degenerative Disc Disease. All forms of disc injury can eventually impinge on the nerves exiting the spine (“Pinched Nerve”) which can create numbness, tingling, burning or sharp pain down the arms or legs. Sharp pain originating from the back and “shooting” down the legs is often referred to as Sciatica. Introduction to Degenerative Disc Disease\nIn order to understand the condition of Degenerative Disc Disease one must know two main facts about discs:\n- Spinal discs do NOT have a direct blood supply. There are no arteries that feed the disc with oxygen and nutrients. Therefore, discs of the spine must receive their oxygen and nutrients from a different source. Normal, healthy discs are “fed” and oxygenated by the constant recycling of the disc fluid that occurs with spinal joint movement. This joint motion “sucks” in fluid filled with oxygen and nutrients and “pumps out” waste fluid. This process of fluid diffusion is greatly affected by internal disc pressure (intradiscal pressure) which brings us to key point #2:\n- The discs of the spine are under constant pressure. The spinal discs are designed to absorb shock and maintain spinal flexibility by acting as cushions during body movement. The discs act similar to shock absorbers in a car. Car shock absorbers maintain a constant pressure to “push back” against the weight and movement of the car. Spinal discs act in a similar fashion. The pressure within the discs pushes the bones of the spine apart preventing them from crashing into one another during activities like running and jumping. Unfortunately, this constant internal disc pressure also pushes the fluid out of the disc consistently every day. This makes it difficult for the body to “suck” in new, healthy disc fluid with its much-needed oxygen and nutrients. These two factors make it difficult for the body to maintain thick, plump, healthy discs making Degenerative Disc Disease one of the more common spinal ailments. |Degenerative Disc Disease: As the disc degenerates it loses height (Disc Height Reduction) allowing the bones above and below to “sandwich” the nerve between them.|\nDegenerative Disc Disease, as the name implies, is caused by the progressive degeneration of the intervertebral disc. Nearly every physical activity (no matter how simple) places strain upon these discs. Over time, repeated daily stress and minor traumas begin to weaken the discs of the spine. This process of accumulated wear and tear will eventually lead to disc degeneration commonly referred to as Degenerative Disc Disease. The process of disc degeneration often begins with a chronic lack of oxygen and nutrients. This can occur because of 1) greater than normal compression of the disc or 2) as a result of decreased hydration.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:98323d54-2e04-4c69-b3f0-aed4fe55fc3e>"]},{"passage":"- Lumbar disc herniation is a common cause of lower back pain and can result from age-related degeneration, physical trauma, genetic predisposition, or lifestyle factors. - Symptoms include lower back pain, sciatica, and numbness or tingling in the legs. - Treatment options range from conservative approaches like rest, medication, and physical therapy to alternative treatments like chiropractic care and acupuncture.

Anatomy and Physiology\nOur spine is a fascinating and complex structure that plays a crucial role in supporting our bodies and allowing us to move freely. To better understand how injuries to the discs occur, it's essential first to understand the anatomy and physiology of the spine. Structure of the Spine\nOur spine is made up of 33 vertebrae stacked on top of each other. These vertebrae are separated by intervertebral discs, which act as shock absorbers and provide flexibility to the spine. The vertebrae are the individual bones that make up the spine. They are divided into different regions: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal. Each vertebra is a uniquely shaped bone that provides support and stability to the spine. The vertebrae are connected by facet joints, allowing smooth and controlled movements. The vertebral column also serves as the protective canal for the spinal cord, which transmits signals between the brain and the rest of the body. Intervertebral discs are the spongy, cartilaginous pads found between the vertebrae. They are composed of an outer fibrous ring called the annulus fibrosus and an inner gel-like substance called the nucleus pulposus. Functions of the Intervertebral Discs\nIntervertebral discs play two primary roles in the overall function and health of the spine:\nOne of the primary functions of the intervertebral discs is to act as a shock absorber for the spine during everyday activities. This shock-absorbing capacity helps protect the vertebrae and prevent injuries. However, the discs can wear down over time, making them less effective at absorbing shock. This wear and tear can increase the risk of conditions like lumbar disc herniation. What Is A Lumbar Disc Herniation? A lumbar disc herniation occurs when the outer layer of an intervertebral disc tears, allowing the soft inner material to bulge or leak out. This can cause nerve compression and pain, numbness, or weakness. Here are the common causes:\nAs we age, the intervertebral discs lose some water content and become less flexible. This process, known as disc degeneration, can make the discs more susceptible to tearing and herniation. Age-related degeneration is a common cause of lumbar disc herniation, highlighting the significance of preserving a healthy spine throughout one's life. Physical Trauma or Injury\nSudden physical trauma or injury, such as a fall, a car accident, or a sports injury, can cause damage to the intervertebral discs and lead to lumbar disc herniation. In these cases, prompt treatment is crucial to minimize long-term damage and prevent chronic pain. Some individuals may have a genetic predisposition to lumbar disc herniation, and research has found several inherited factors that affect intervertebral disc structure and strength. While you cannot change your genetics, understanding your family history can help you take proactive measures to protect your spine and reduce the risk of herniation. Several lifestyle factors can contribute to lumbar disc herniation, including:\nA sedentary lifestyle can weaken the muscles that support the spine. That lack of stabilizer strength increases pressure on the intervertebral discs, resulting in a higher risk of herniation. Physical activity and targeted exercises can help maintain a strong and healthy spine. Poor posture can place additional stress on the intervertebral discs and increase the risk of herniation. It can be static (think sitting or standing) or dynamic (think how you lift things). Excess body weight can put extra pressure on the intervertebral discs, making them more prone to damage and herniation.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:9bb3f506-f6c3-4742-a09a-96f0ed637df9>"]},{"passage":"- We strive to provide complete care for our patients. Learn more about all the services we provide. Your Spine 101\nAn adult human spine typically consists of 26 moveable segments: seven cervical vertebras, twelve thoracic vertebras, five lumbar vertebras, one sacrum, and one coccyx (tailbone). Intervertebral discs separate the segments from the second cervical vertebra down to the sacrum and a thinner disc is present between the sacrum and coccyx. Intervertebral discs comprise about 25% of the height of an adult spine. Intervertebral joints connect vertebras and these joints are lined by lubricating synovial membranes. All of these structures are designed and built to last a lifetime. Intervertebral discs, which are gel-like colloids, begin to lose their water content at about age 2. This slow resorption is perfectly normal. Nothing lasts forever, and all living structures degrade and deteriorate over time. With this in mind, we can understand how it is that x-rays of older persons show various degrees of degeneration or arthritis of the spinal joints and intervertebral discs. These physiological changes are ominously or portentously referred to as \"degenerative disc disease\" by certain specialists, but it is important to remember that these structures deteriorate naturally. Degeneration or breakdown of spinal joints and intervertebral discs is not a disease, but rather a standard process that occurs over time, more rapidly in some persons than in others. There are measures we can employ to resist the effects of spinal degenerative changes and possibly even slow the process of degeneration itself. Spinal degenerative changes are problematic as they result in loss of resilience, flexibility, and mobility of the spine as a whole. The overall result is degradation of spinal function and increased possibility for strains, sprains, and other injuries. Solutions are available, as research studies have consistently demonstrated that regular vigorous exercise and healthy nutrition provide significant benefit in maintaining spinal structure and function. Regular vigorous exercise such as walking, running, bike riding, and strength training provide consistent weight bearing stress to spinal joints and intervertebral discs. Such mechanical stresses are required for these structures to retain their physiological integrity. For example, exercise pumps fluid back into intervertebral discs and increases lubrication of spinal joints. Healthy eating provides the nutrients required to support efficient repair and replacement of the cells and tissues of spinal structural components. Thus, by choosing to implement healthy lifestyles, we help keep our spines in peak physical condition and become better able to withstand the negative effects of natural physiological forces occurring over time. Having a healthy spine also depends on getting regular chiropractic care. Exercise, good nutrition, and sufficient rest are the primary requirements for spinal health, but there may be limitations and restrictions in the form of spinal joint dysfunction and nerve interference. These limitations prevent your spine from achieving optimal function and may lead to stiffness, loss of mobility, ongoing pain, and even injury. By detecting and correcting spinal joint dysfunction, regular chiropractic care helps eliminate sources of nerve interference and enables your spine to do its job, which includes handling heavy mechanical loads and moving you around during all your activities throughout the day. Regular chiropractic care partners with your other healthy lifestyle choices to help you achieve high levels of health and well-being now and into the future. - Geusens PP, van den Bergh JP: Osteoporosis and osteoarthritis: shared mechanisms and epidemiology.

Everybody understands the dangers associated with cigarette use but is nicotine by itself dangerous? How much nicotine do cigarettes exactly contain? Moreover, does nicotine occur naturally in tobacco or are the tobacco companies responsible for adding it? Where does the nicotine found in e-liquids come from? What is Nicotine and What Are Its Origins? Let us begin with the simpler question: Does nicotine occur naturally in tobacco? Nicotine is definitely an alkaloid present in tobacco and various other members of the nightshade family including peppers, tomatoes, potatoes, and eggplant. You can rightly state that humanity has been consumers of nicotine for millennia since tobacco cultivation started in the Americas about 6,000 B.C. Back then people most likely smoked or chewed it. Even Christophe Columbus himself actually received a gift of dried tobacco once he arrived in the Bahamas. He even carried tobacco seeds and leaves with him back to Europe. The Evolution of Nicotine\nNicot de Villemain, who was the French diplomat responsible for the introduction of tobacco to the Queen of France who then used it for treating her headaches was whom nicotine was named in honor of. You might not believe it but tobacco was at a time believed to have medicinal qualities. However, as early as the 17th Century, doctors had started discovering a correlation between the use of tobacco and diseases like cancer. Over 25 million pounds of tobacco were being cultivated annually around the same time in the Jamestown colony alone, thus making it a top export of the American colonies. It is worth noting that consuming nicotine alone is not believed to be the root of health problems related to smoking. Tobacco and even cigarettes themselves contain other chemicals that are known to be carcinogenic. Nicotine was once believed to be the key driver of dependency on tobacco but new evidence suggests that those other chemicals actually play a greater role in cigarette addiction. Interestingly, recent studies have revealed that nicotine by itself might actually possess some medicinal properties. Researchers from all over the world are successfully experimenting with using nicotine for treating Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s, and even depression. The Use of Nicotine Today\nA large number of people still consume nicotine from various tobacco products including cigars, cigarettes, or even chewing tobacco. Nicotine is obviously found in some e-liquids and nicotine patches. The nicotine used in nicotine replacement therapies is actually extracted from tobacco but it is sometimes manufactured artificially. The theory behind nicotine replacement is that it works by mitigating the withdrawal effects of tobacco. We currently understand that addiction to cigarettes has several different facets, which is the reason why the development of e-cigarettes happened: to mimic closely the smoking process but without the associated health risks. If you are thinking of adopting vaping to replace traditional smoking, you should first determine if you would like an e-liquid containing nicotine or not. Some smokers may find themselves not requiring the nicotine since they are able to satisfy their urges through the act of vaping. If you do prefer taking the nicotine route, you need to choose a nicotine strength that depends on the number of cigarettes that you currently smoke on a daily basis. You need to understand that the effects of nicotine usually differ depending on the method of delivery that you use. For instance, research shows that people that vape usually take in lower amounts of nicotine per puff than traditional smokers. In part 2 of the series, we will be focusing on how much nicotine is contained in cigarettes and reveal the amount of nicotine that smokers consume.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:d346b643-d24f-4d27-b93d-2ce56fa23091>"]},{"passage":"What is disc herniation? Composed of bone and intervertebral discs, the spine plays a major role in supporting and bearing the weight of the body. By giving a cushioning effect, the intervertebral discs allow us to achieve a certain degree of body flexion. As modern people often bow their heads to look down on their mobile phones and bend their spines incorrectly, the intervertebral discs in the neck and waist are often stressed, which make disc herniation an even more common problem nowadays. Intervertebral discs are in fact surrounded by fibrous tissues. In the centre of the discs is a jelly-like substance called nucleus pulposus, which is tightly wrapped and protected by the annulus. When the tissues have been stressed for a prolonged period, aged or strained, the annulus may tear. Then when the gel is squeezed out, the problem of disc herniation will result. The protruding discs may be pressed to the surrounding nerves, causing sciatica, which often comes with pain, tingling sensation, numbness or weakness.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ddb1ede2-77b4-46a4-a6a6-e834eff76d65>"]},{"passage":"Helen W, Merry CL, Blaker JJ, Gough JE (2007) Threedimensional culture of annulus fibrosus cells within PDLLA\/Bioglass composite foam scaffolds: assessment of cell attachment, proliferation and extracellular matrix production.

I mean, what the heck are you supposed to do with that, right? Am I right?! Well, let’s make sure this never happens to you again. Here’s the ONE tool you need to solve all your online shopping woes: Lucky for you, you can find it on Amazon, in practically any big box store (Target, Walmart, Kmart), or in an arts and crafts store in your neighborhood, and it’ll cost you a few dollars at most. How is tailor’s tape going to solve all my online shopping woes? This little tool can measure every single square inch of that hot bod of yours. And those measurements are exactly what you need to make those confusing online purchases much easier. I don’t want to measure every square inch of my body. Okay, fine. I was over-exaggerating anyway. You really only need 6, maybe 7, measurements. That’s it! With those 6 (or 7) measurements, you can buy any garment anywhere without having to try it on. Pretty nifty, right? So what parts of my body should I measure? Good question. To make it easy, why not take a look at this handy dandy diagram below: Here are some descriptive definitions for the more confusing ones: Sleeve length: Measure from the base of the neck, across the traps to the shoulder, down the arm, to your wrist bone. Chest: Measure the widest part of your chest, usually across the nipples (ooh la la). Natural waist: Your natural waist is generally where your torso bends if you were to stand straight with your legs shoulder width apart, and tipped over slightly to one side. That crease sorta in the middle of your ribs? That’s your natural waist. Hip: Where your pants typically sit. If you finger that area (wow, really?) you can feel your hip bone. Your tape should come right across there, parallel to the ground. Inseam: Measure from the inside of your thigh (this is too much) to the heel. These are the only measurements you’ll need. Some tips on getting an accurate measurement This is a little difficult to do if you’re on your own, unless you have something like this. If you’re not as fancy and you picked up traditional tailor’s tape, better get your patient significant other to help you out. Keep the tape straight It’s really important to make sure the tape is level as your S.O. is wrapping it around your body parts (whoa). If it isn’t straight, chances are you’ll get a skewed measurement. An inch can make a big difference in the fit of your clothes, so make sure your designated measurer is as precise as possible. If you’re measuring your chest, waist, or hips, the tape should be parallel to the ground. Too loose = bad You want to feel the tape wrapped around you. If it’s too loose, most likely it’s also not straight, so you’re going to get an inaccurate measurement no matter what. Too tight = bad Yes, you want to feel the tape wrapped around you, but you don’t want to cinch it so snugly that your spare tire is cascading over it, enveloping the tape in a wall of skin and lard like some weird 80s horror film.

J.Crew sizing is different from H&M sizing, and retailers can even be inconsistent across their own line. Sizing inconsistencies can be attributed to different fabrics, updated cuts of products bearing the same name, and even vanity sizing. When taking your measurements, be sure to use a cloth measuring tape (or other options that we recommend in the absence of one) — not a metal measuring tape. This will ensure that you’re measuring your body accurately. In addition, measure only over bare skin or skin-tight clothes so as to ensure the most accurate measurements. What You Should Measure\nChest or Bust\nThis measurement is used for tops and dresses. Women: Place one end of the tape measure at the fullest part of your bust and wrap it around your body to get the measurement, keeping the tape parallel to the floor. Men and kids: Place one end of the tape measure at the center of your chest. Wrap it around your body, keeping the tape parallel to the floor. Bras are sized using a unique system based on two measurements of the bust area. For detailed instructions on how to measure to determine bra size and get a correct fit, please see: How to Measure for a Bra. This measurement is used for tops, dresses, and bottoms. Most clothing lines use the measurement of the “natural waist” for their size guides. To measure your natural waist, you want to find the narrowest part of your waist, located above your belly button and below your rib cage. Note some brands use a “low” waist measurement. For this, you would measure at the point where your trousers would normally ride.\n\nHow to Measure Your Body: Neck Around\nPlace the measuring tape around the neck at the height where the collar would normally rest. This will be just below your Adam’s apple. Stand relaxed. Do not crane your neck out or squeeze your chin down. The tape should be resting lightly on the skin, not squeezing it. Hold one finger under the tape measure to ensure some room for comfort. Do not try to account for shrinkage by adding extra here. We will do that for you.\n\n*above measurements are to be used as guide only. We reccomend using a tape to take your own measurements. Hold tape measure securely at specific area to be measured. Ensure tape is straight and parallel to the floor during measuring process. Bust: Measure around chest st the fullest part of your bust and across your back. Waist: Measure the narrowest part of your natural waistline. Hip: Measure around your body at the fullest part of your hip and bottom while standing with the heels together.\n\nBefore making any dress, you need to first take the necessary body measurements of the person who will wear the outfit. If you are making your own dress, you need to take your own measurements. If you are dressmaking for another person, you need to schedule a session so you can take the necessary and important body measurements. You should include the necessary measurement tools in your dressmaking kit. The basic tool for measuring sizes is a tape measure. You can use a nylon or plastic tape measure for the purpose. Use the English standard measurement (i.e. inches). Before proceeding to measure anyone, be sure the person is not wearing bulky outfit. Advise the person to come wearing well-fitted undergarments. This is because oversized underwear may drastically affect the accuracy of measurements. For women, bras should fit well, and for men, boxers and other loose underwear should not be worn when in the session. Make the person to be measured stand correctly and in good body posture. He or she should stand proudly, with eyes gazing straight ahead and both arms very relaxed at either side. The back should be ideally straight and shoulders in a relaxed state. Some people do not naturally stand this proud, but advise the person you are measuring to observe correct and proud standing for the sake of getting accurate and ideal body measurements. There is a need to take a good position base. When finally measuring, take note that the job does not end in measuring the bust, the waist, and the hips. Other body areas should also be measured correctly. There can be differences in procedures when measuring men and women, but there are general body areas to scale. • To measure the chest, put the tape measure under the person’s arms. Wrap the tape measure around the area, specifically to the fullest bust line part. • To measure the waist line, put the measuring tape at the person’s belly button. Let the tool fall naturally. The area where it fell is the waist line, the measurement you should take. • Measure the fullest part of the person’s hip. • To measure the arm length, place the tape measure at the top of the arm in the armpit area extending until the wrist. Bend the arm without taking off the tape. Take the measurement as the arm length. • Take back length measurement after determining the length from the base of the neck until the waistline. • Measure the length from hip to heel to get the accurate leg measurement. In taking measurements before dressmaking, it is a standard practice to measure the areas thrice in one session. There might be differences resulting from changes in positions and starting points of measurements. There is a need to do so to ensure measurement accuracy.\n\nThe best way is to find a freckle and use it every time. LOL! That's what I do. For record keeping, what matters most is consistency. As for measuring for clothing, I have no idea. I'm bad about the waist and the hips. Proper \"hip\" measurement for me seems more like my butt, not my hips. My hip bones are a lot higher than where I think my hips must actually be. Dr. Oz wants us to have a waist size of 32 or smaller and he allows for sucking in. I do not suck in, but that's just me. And I like to pull the tape pretty tight only because that way I can't second guess the way I do it each time. If I'm always pulling really tight then it's the same every time.\n\nHow many times have you stumbled upon a sweet deal online but never completed the purchase because you couldn’t figure out if the last one in your size would actually fit (and there were no returns, no exchanges)?

While I’m intrigued by the idea of getting a dress that’s made to fit my body exactly, the idea of measuring myself at home before sending in the numbers makes me nervous. What if I do it wrong and eventually unwrap a package that’s not as spot-on as it should be? Because I’m certain someone out there shares these anxieties, I quizzed Anne Dayton, founder and CEO of PIOL Dress, a new company that offers a handful of timeless dress silhouettes in all kinds of colors and patterns. Along with the precise fit, you’re guided to find the one that matches your complexion best via a favorite trick of Edith Head, one of Hollywood’s most illustrious costumers. With her answers, below, I think both you and I are headed toward some very well fitting garments, indeed. Q: Is it best to take measurements nude or while wearing something simple like a t-shirt and jeans? A: We ask you to measure yourself in the bra and underwear you’d most likely wear with the dress. Q: For the bust measurement, bra on or off? A: Definitely in your bra and, if possible, the one you’re most likely to be wearing with the dress. Q: In the ideal situation, should we ask a best friend to measure us rather than trying to do it ourselves? A: If you can ask someone to do it, that would be great. Otherwise, measure yourself in front of a full-length mirror to be sure the tape is parallel to the floor in the back. If the measuring tape isn’t even as it goes around your figure, the measurements could be off. Q: Are there any common mistakes people make when using a measuring tape? A: The most common mistake is to measure your high hip rather than your hip at their fullest point. The other one is to give us your bra size as the bust measurement—it’s not the same measurement at all. Q: Does it matter if measurements are taken first thing in the morning or at the end of the day? A: We haven’t really examined the difference of your measurements from morning to night. As you’ll be wearing the dress throughout the day, I’d imagine mid-day is the optimum time for measuring. Q: Real talk: Should we be trying to measure the “best” version of ourselves—standing up tall and straight with shoulders down and stomach in—or just how we typically stand? A: Standing straight, tall, and with feet together is the most desirable position. The one measurement that can move is the waistline. It’s very important that you breathe while measuring your waist, rather than holding in your breath or stomach. Our tailored style dress is very fitted in the bodice and waist, and if you measure your waist while holding your stomach in, the waistband could be too snug. One of the beauties of a custom-made dress is that it can be fitted to your figure, [but] still a pleasure to wear. Q: So fibbing numbers at all, for any reason, is a horrible idea? A: We truly need your real measurements. If you fib, the dress will be too tight and probably in the wrong places. If parts of the dress are too tight, you’re actually calling attention to that area. In terms of comfort, we’ve [considered that with] all our silhouettes, so there’s never a need to add to your measurements.","passages":[{"passage":"If you’re into online shopping, knowing your body measurements is a necessity to getting clothes in the right sizes. J.Crew sizing is different from H&M sizing, and retailers can even be inconsistent across their own line. Sizing inconsistencies can be attributed to different fabrics, updated cuts of products bearing the same name, and even vanity sizing. When taking your measurements, be sure to use a cloth measuring tape (or other options that we recommend in the absence of one) — not a metal measuring tape. This will ensure that you’re measuring your body accurately. In addition, measure only over bare skin or skin-tight clothes so as to ensure the most accurate measurements. What You Should Measure\nChest or Bust\nThis measurement is used for tops and dresses.

If you are making your own dress, you need to take your own measurements. If you are dressmaking for another person, you need to schedule a session so you can take the necessary and important body measurements. You should include the necessary measurement tools in your dressmaking kit. The basic tool for measuring sizes is a tape measure. You can use a nylon or plastic tape measure for the purpose. Use the English standard measurement (i.e. inches). Before proceeding to measure anyone, be sure the person is not wearing bulky outfit. Advise the person to come wearing well-fitted undergarments. This is because oversized underwear may drastically affect the accuracy of measurements. For women, bras should fit well, and for men, boxers and other loose underwear should not be worn when in the session. Make the person to be measured stand correctly and in good body posture. He or she should stand proudly, with eyes gazing straight ahead and both arms very relaxed at either side. The back should be ideally straight and shoulders in a relaxed state. Some people do not naturally stand this proud, but advise the person you are measuring to observe correct and proud standing for the sake of getting accurate and ideal body measurements. There is a need to take a good position base. When finally measuring, take note that the job does not end in measuring the bust, the waist, and the hips.

Mental health conditions and depression are confusing and overwhelming, but the good news is that the relief is now possible as there are more advanced treatment options available than ever before to help you live a healthy life. Depression generally leads to isolation from the friends and family, and an only medical professional can provide the necessary help. Most often, medication and talk therapy help decrease depression, but those with major depressive disorder or treatment-resistant depression need to try multiple medications or advanced therapies like TMS. TMS is a non-invasive and drug-free therapy prescribed for patients who suffer from MDD and don’t respond well to medication. TMS delivers electromagnetic pulses to the pre-frontal cortex that regulates mood and stimulate cortical neurons to relieve the depression symptoms. Approximately 50-60% of people suffering from depression who have tried and failed to benefit from medications, witness full remission with TMS. In 2008, FDA cleared TMS for treating depression, and it is administered in sessions that generally last for 30-40 minutes, five times a week over 4-6 weeks. No sedation or anesthesia is given to the patients; therefore, they can resume their usual activities right after their session. Repeated treatment encourages the formation of new circuits providing relief to the patients. Unlike depression medications, TMS is not associated with systemic side effects that are caused by the passage of drugs through the bloodstream. Only reported side effect of TMS is mild-to-moderate discomfort caused by the electromagnetic pulses. Some of the common side effects include: 2. Spasms, tingling, and twitching of the facial muscles 3. Discomfort in the scalp at the site of stimulation You can ask the doctor to adjust the stimulation level to reduce the symptoms if you experience painful scalp sensation or facial twitching. Or can take over-the-counter pain medication and tend to lessen over the course of treatmen1t. There is minimal risk of seizure. To ensure that you are eligible for TMS a physical examination and psychiatric evolution to discuss depression is done. The evaluation helps you make sure that TMS is safe and a good option. TMS is not safe in the following conditions: You are pregnant or planning to get pregnant There is an implanted medical device in the body You have a history of seizures There is brain damage from past injury or illness You suffer from frequent headaches To ensure you get the best treatment, it is suggested to look for a well-reputed clinic. Getting the treatment from experienced practitioners and healthcare providers will ensure exceptional comfort and minimum side effects. Before you start the therapy, make an appointment and see if you are comfortable with them, and you feel calm at the clinic. Also, check whether the clinic accepts health insurance as most health insurance companies these days cover TMS treatment.","question_category":"first turn question; Natural","question_category_desc":"the initial question of a conversation, and therefore self-contained and understandable, without any other context.; phrased in the way people typically speak, reflecting everyday language use, without formal or artificial structure.","user_category":"Expert","user_category_desc":"A specialized user with deep understanding of the corpus.","question":"What are the common side effects associated with TMS treatment for depression?","gold":"TMS is not associated with systemic side effects from drugs in the bloodstream.

Mental health conditions and depression are confusing and overwhelming, but the good news is that the relief is now possible as there are more advanced treatment options available than ever before to help you live a healthy life. Depression generally leads to isolation from the friends and family, and an only medical professional can provide the necessary help. Most often, medication and talk therapy help decrease depression, but those with major depressive disorder or treatment-resistant depression need to try multiple medications or advanced therapies like TMS.

How does TMS help alleviate depression? TMS uses non-invasive electromagnetic energy to stimulate the brain. Research on TMS and depression have found that the electromagnetic pulses, when applied to depressed areas of the brain, activates neurons thought to be responsible for depression symptoms. Why would someone choose TMS Along with medication? Medications are often the first line of defense in treating depression. Most patients will respond favorably to antidepressants. However, sometimes people need additional help. TMS can help those who are experiencing treatment-resistant depression. Also, medications can come with a range of side effects and other issues. Some of the most common side effects of antidepressants are weight gain, stomach upset, dry mouth, drowsiness, and sexual dysfunction. When receiving TMS, it’s important to also work with your mental healthcare professional on finding the right medications for you. For patients who don’t respond to medications or therapy as well as they’d hoped, TMS may be the right choice for them. If you or a loved one are struggling with depression episodes that aren’t going away, contact Pulse TMS. Our technicians are standing by to answer your questions, so you can see if you’re a candidate for TMS treatment.\n\nTMS can improve depression symptoms in clients with treatment-resistant depression who have not responded to other depression treatments like antidepressant medications or talk therapy. It also has far fewer side effects than antidepressant medication, which can lead to weight gain and high blood pressure. TMS for Bipolar Disorder\nTMS can be an effective treatment for symptoms of bipolar disorder as it can increase the excitability of brain activity in the target area of the brain, improving symptoms of depression. While studies have found that it may induce manic or hypomanic symptoms through stimulation, almost all bipolar disorder treatments carry this risk. TMS for Teens and Kids\nMood disorders like depression are widespread among children and teens across the world. Inadequate treatment can lead to conduct disorders, illness, poor performance at school, and a greater risk of suicide. The good news is that depression in teens is treatable and can open the doors to the future they dream of. TMS therapy can be an effective treatment for young people with depression, and the procedure's minimal side effects and accessibility make it an attractive option for young people who may want to fit TMS treatment alongside their work or studies. What Is Deep TMS Therapy? Deep TMS therapy is a form of TMS therapy that uses special combinations of coils. These coils produce electromagnetic pulses that reach below the surface of the skull, and different coils are used to reach each brain region. The FDA has approved deep TMS with the 'H1' coil for the treatment of people with treatment-resistant depression who have not responded to psychotherapy or medicine. How Much Does TMS Therapy Cost? TMS therapy can be one of the most cost-effective treatments for depression and other medical conditions. Many insurance providers cover TMS therapy under certain conditions. We accept a number of insurances as well as have payment options. To get more information contact us. We are available 24 hours a day. Is TMS Treatment the Same As Shock Therapy? Electroshock therapy (ECT) involves applying electrical currents directly to the client's head when they are sedated by anesthesia. While it can lead to short-term cognitive improvements, it is an invasive procedure that may require someone to take a break from work and home responsibilities. On the other hand, TMS therapy is non-invasive, passing electromagnetic currents through the skull. It is completely pain-free and has few side effects other than a temporary mild headache or skull discomfort. Who Should Avoid TMS Treatment? Clients who have permanent metal implants in their heads other than dental braces or fillings should not receive TMS therapy. The electromagnetic signals could cause these implants to heat up, move, or function incorrectly, risking injury or death. Implants that prevent a client from participating in TMS therapy include:\n- Deep brain stimulators\n- Aneurysm coils or clips\n- Tattoos on the face with metallic or magnetic ink\n- Electrodes that monitor brain activity\n- Any other metal medical devices or objects in or near the head\nThose considering TMS treatment should also speak with a doctor if they:\n- Take any medication\n- Have a history of seizures\n- Have a family history of epilepsy\n- Live with co-occurring mental disorders\n- Have a brain injury\n- Have had other medical conditions\n- Have previously been treated with TMS\n- Are pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant\nWhat Are the Side-Effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation? Side effects of TMS treatment are usually mild to moderate and improve soon after each session. They also tend to decrease as clients participate in sessions throughout their treatment. Common side effects may include:\n- Scalp discomfort\n- Tingling, spasms, or twitching of facial muscles\n- Lightheadedness or dizziness\nThough these side effects are mild, doctors may be able to reduce them by adjusting the intensity of the magnetic fields. There is currently not enough evidence regarding the long-term side effects of TMS treatment. Mental Wellness Treatment and Neurodiversity - TMS Therapy Near Me\nNeurodiversity refers to the difference between the parts of the brain that impact the way people socialize, learn, feel, and behave. Neurodiversity supports the view that when a brain functions differently, it is not a disability or an illness that needs to be treated. Instead, those struggling should think about adapting their social structures to accommodate their differences.\n\nCommonly asked questions about Transcranila Magnetic Stimlation (TMS) answered by Dr. Daniel Press, Director, TMS Clinical Program at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center:\nWhat is TMS? TMS stands for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. It uses magnetic fields to induce a current in specific brain areas and thus stimulate or suppress brain activity. Using TMS allows doctors to change brain activity without surgery and with minimal discomfort to the patient. TMS has been used to treat a variety of disorders including migraines, stroke, Parkinson's disease and depression. Who is a good candidate for TMS for depression? In 2009, the Food and Drug Administration approved the NeuroStar TMS Therapy system for treatment of people with major depressive disorder who haven't seen satisfactory improvement from medication. As with any treatment option, you and your doctor should discuss if TMS therapy is right for you. What are the sessions like and how many are needed? During each TMS session, patients sit comfortably in a chair. The stimulation coil (wand) is held just above the head, targeting magnetic pulses to a 2-3 centimeter area of a specific area of the brain. The nature of the magnetic fields allows them to pass through the patient's hair, skin and skull and into the mood-regulating area without being distorted in any way. Patients do not require anesthesia or sedation. In the brain, these magnetic pulses produce small electrical currents. The electricity created in the brain cannot be felt by the patient, but is sufficient to change the activity of brain cells. Applied repeatedly, these magnetic pulses modify the activity of the targeted brain area and can thus help the brain overcome the dysfunction associated with depression. Treatments last for about 40 minutes and occur every day for a period of several weeks. Is it safe? TMS is a safe treatment for depression if appropriate guidelines are followed. In more than 10,000 treatments administered in clinical studies, the most common side effect was mild-to-moderate scalp pain or discomfort at the treatment area, which declined \"markedly after the first week.\" Fewer than 5 percent of patients stopped treatment due to adverse effects. There is a very small risk of seizure - about the same risk as when taking medications to treat depression. Does it work? In clinical studies involving hundreds of people with major depressive disorder, significant improvement was recorded for symptoms of core depression, anxiety, and other forms of psychological distress. In most patients, benefits lasted through the 6-month study follow-up period. While NeuroStar TMS Therapy has been proven effective, not all patients will benefit. Patients should be carefully monitored for worsening symptoms. Will my insurance cover it? While the treatment was recently FDA approved, not all insurance companies yet cover the treatments. Our staff will assist you in contacting your insurance company about coverage. Where do I call for more information? Call the TMS Clinical Program at the Berenson-Allen Center for Noninvasive Brain Stimulation, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center at 617-667-0303.\n\nApproximately 5-10% of patients experience discomfort at the site of stimulation. In general this has not been a problem when administering TMS to patients volunteering for research studies. How long does a treatment session last? It depends on the research protocol, but generally each session takes about a half an hour. One procedure includes 2 daily sessions approximately 20 minutes each, with a 30-minute break between them. It is performed for 10 days, with a rest period of 2 days between the first 5 days and the second 5 days. There are 20 sessions in total. How many times do you need to receive TMS? Research protocols vary in the treatment duration, but most require at least two weeks of daily stimulation given five times per week, some require up to 6 weeks. Are there any side-effects or risks associated with TMS? Yes. The main risk of TMS, as with any pulsed energy, is inducing a seizure, though with close monitoring this complication has been very rare. No seizures have been reported in the scientific literature since safety guidelines have been implemented. For stimulation at low frequency (1 to 5 pulses per second) there have been no reports of seizures. Insofar as the brain is directly stimulated by TMS, there is a potential risk of disturbing the brain’s normal functions. However, in depression studies reported so far, no cognitive side-effects like loss of memory, negative changes in concentration and other cognitive capacities have been reported. This is in stark contract to the well known cognitive side effects associated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Is TMS widely available to patients in the U.S. and Canada? TMS is not yet FDA cleared but has been approved in Canada and can be purchased from Biophysica. Why are researchers evaluating TMS? TMS has some very unique properties. It is non-invasive, (does not break the skin and can be delivered in a physician’s office) can easily be focused on small areas of the brain, and can change brain activity. This makes it particularly well suited for treating the brain, while minimizing side effects typical with other psychiatric treatments which affect areas of the brain and body not involved in the disorder. Specifically for major depression, researchers understand there are a significant number of patients suffering from this disorder that are not helped by the available medications and other therapies, only receive partial benefit, or are not able to take medications at all. TMS offers hope that, if proven effective, many of these patients may be able to experience symptom relief. Reviewed by Stanford Miller, July 2004\nTMS is used in many different areas of research and therapeutics including:\nCognitive Neuroscience - in the investigation of learning, memory, creativity, speech, hearing, visual, perception and functional connection\nPsychiatry - to influence specific brain function within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex To relieve anxiety, depression, bulemia (bulimia), schizophrenia and depersonalization as a better alternative to Electric Shock Treatment also called ECT. Neurophysiology - used in the stimulation of the peripheral and central nerve pathways. Eliciting motor evoked potentials to advanced brain mapping research techniques. Rehabilitation - used in the promotion of muscle recovery and the relief of pain and nerve spasticity.

An initial assessment by Dr. Creelman will determine the appropriate dose of the magnetic pulse and the exact area of the brain the magnet should activate. Patients typically receive 20 – 30 treatments over four to six weeks. There may also be a taper phase. During the TMS treatment the patient is monitored to ensure correct positioning and comfort level. More patients in the most recent clinical studies who failed one antidepressant trial succeeded with TMS than any second antidepressant or therapy. Are There Risks and Side Effects with TMS? More than 10,000 treatments were safely performed just during clinical trials. Patient reported no side effects like those associated with antidepressant medication (weight gain, dry mouth, drowsiness, etc. ), no seizures and no cognitive side effects (memory loss, ability to concentrate). Scalp discomfort during the procedure is the most common side effect. TMS should not be used for patients with implanted metallic devices that include metal plates in the skull or aneurysm coils, clips or stents. Special precautions are recommended for individuals with implants such as pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators. Is TMS covered by insurance? Both private and public (Medicare and Medicaid) insurers determine eligibility for TMS on an individual basis. Patients should work directly with their insurers to receive approval for TMS. Vero Beach, FL 32960\n\nFurthermore, the symptoms a vet experiences may be different than that of someone else who didn't serve. While symptoms vary from one person to the next, there are some common signs of depression in veterans you can look out for:\n- Feeling sad or hopeless\n- Disinterest in life’s activities\n- Gaining or losing weight\n- Excessive or difficulty sleeping\n- Feeling lethargic\n- Feeling guilty\n- Problems in relationships with others\nIf you experience symptoms of PTSD and depression, you could also be experiencing anxiety—a study by Ginzburg et al showed that cases of PTSD, anxiety, and depression in veterans were more common than cases of PTSD by itself or a combination of PTSD and anxiety. It can be difficult to pay attention to your feelings and ask yourself why you are feeling a certain way, but it’s important to understand what you’re going through after your service to figure out how to treat potential problems. If you find that you experience these symptoms following your deployment, it’s important to allow yourself to feel what you’re going through and rely on the comfort of loved ones to help you work through it. It is normal to feel out of sync with people around you soon after you get home, but that will ease with time. Should all of this become too much for you to handle, don’t hesitate to seek professional help. There is no reason to feel ashamed to do so, because so many others who served in combat share that experience. Depression is a treatable condition. TMS Therapy for Veteran Depression\nAccording to a 2017 study by Mi et al, veterans may respond differently to treatment for major depressive disorder than the average civilian. Compared to others, the veteran population showed a greater proportion of those who were not efficiently responding to pharmacological and psychotherapy treatment. When a patient doesn’t improve with psychotherapy and antidepressant medication—having tried at least two antidepressants at the appropriate doses—then they may be suffering from treatment resistant depression (TRD). The FDA recently approved the use of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Therapy (TMS), a safe and noninvasive treatment method, for treating veterans with TRD. At Transformations, we use NeuroStar, a brand of TMS that specializes in targeting under-active brain areas associated with depression. In addition to being noninvasive, NeuroStar is non-systemic, meaning that because it is not consumed orally, NeuroStar does not course through the body in the bloodstream. During a treatment session, the TMS technician or physician will place a magnetic coil on your head in order to administer magnetic pulses to the targeted brain areas. Side effects are minimal compared to those of antidepressants, so no more nausea, weight gain, or dizziness. Treatment is largely painless (some patients experience a headache following a treatment session, but those can be helped with over the counter pain relievers and eventually subside over the course of treatment). TMS is not the same as electroconvulsive (shock) therapy. Treatment sessions last anywhere from 20-50 minutes and administered five days a week for five to six weeks. You will be fully wake for the procedure—and because there’s no anesthesia administration, patients are able to drive themselves home following a treatment session. If you or a loved one are a veteran suffering from depression following combat, speak to a medical professional about treatment. If it is a true medical emergency, please call 911. In addition to reaching out to your physician or a mental health professional, there is a Veteran Crisis Line that offers free support 24\/7. Call 1-800-273-8255 and press 1, chat online, or text 838255. It is not uncommon for veterans to suffer from conditions such as PTSD and depression following combat, so there’s no need to believe your feelings are invalid and that you will just work through it. If you have tried antidepressants and psychotherapy alone, talk to a medical professional about a prescription for TMS therapy at Transformations. What other questions do you have about treating depression in veterans? Let us know in the comments!\n\nPeople living with autism (TMS for Autism), Parkinson's, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (TMS for ADHD), and other conditions may describe themselves as neurodiverse. At GIA Chicago, our treatment programs accommodate neurodiversity. We recognize that neurodiverse clients may experience conditions and respond to treatments differently. Our experts consider neurodiversity when designing treatment plans which may include TMS therapy. What Is the Success Rate of TMS Therapy? The success rate of TMS therapy depends on the medical conditions it is being used to treat. For many conditions, scientists need to do more research to determine accurate rates. However, the evidence so far is very promising. Research has shown that up to 62% of people living with depression experience complete remission, meaning that they no longer experience any symptoms of depression. Other studies have found that symptoms of anxiety improve by 33%. How Many Sessions Does It Take for TMS to Work? Every client is different. Some clients may notice small changes in a standard course of TMS after one to two weeks (5 - 10 sessions), while others start to see improvements in the fourth or fifth week (20 - 25 sessions). It's recommended that clients complete an entire course of treatment regardless of when they first see improvements. Is TMS Painful? Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a relatively painless procedure that can be a lifeline for clients struggling with their mental wellness. It is a safe and non-invasive procedure with fewer side effects than other treatment options. Will TMS Work for Me? Many people try TMS when other treatment methods do not work. It can be a life-changing experience, with two-thirds of people achieving complete remission after treatment. But it is important to note that the TMS experience does not work for everyone. Contact us today to learn more about TMS and discuss whether it is the best alternative treatment method for you. Can TMS Make You Worse? There is no evidence that Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation can worsen symptoms of any condition the treatment is often prescribed for. However, it is possible that for people with certain conditions, TMS is not a viable treatment and they may experience negative effects. Clinical studies of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder show mixed results. Can TMS Damage Your Brain? TMS is entirely non-invasive. Therefore it does not require any form of surgery or the implantation of electrodes. There is no evidence that TMS treatments damage the brain in any way, as long as a person has been confirmed a suitable candidate for TMS by their primary care physician, TMS provider, or other qualified doctors. What does TMS Therapy feel like? The physical sensations experienced by patients during a treatment session are like moderate tapping or knocking on the skull, caused by the magnetic pulses generated by the TMS machine. While few patients would describe TMS as actually pleasant, it is not uncommon for people to doze off during treatment, and even those who enjoy it least would most likely describe it as unpleasant rather than painful. Can TMS Change Your Personality? TMS cannot fundamentally change your personality, either temporarily or permanently. By alleviating symptoms of major depression and other mental health concerns, TMS may lead to significant changes in mood and behavior. However, rather than changing your personality, TMS helps you reconnect with your inner-self, rediscover your passions, and express yourself to the full. How Long Does TMS Therapy Last? A typical course of TMS therapy consists of daily sessions for six to nine weeks. Some providers may reduce the frequency of sessions towards the end of the TMS treatment process, while others may offer twice-daily sessions. Most TMS sessions last from 20-40 minutes. Your first treatment session, known as the mapping session, is usually a little longer. How Long Does It Take for TMS to Start Working? There is significant variation in the time it takes for clients to experience the first improvements. While some clients notice results in the first week, others may see changes in the fourth or fifth week. If you notice improvements later than other people, this does not mean that the treatment is ineffective. Is TMS Treatment Safe? TMS is a safe, non-invasive treatment that is FDA-approved for major depression. TMS also has very few side effects than other treatment methods like antidepressant medications. The most common side-effects of TMS treatment are mild to moderate scalp discomfort at the treatment site and temporary headaches at the end of a session.\n\nWayne Creelman, M.D. – Depression and Psychiatry Treatment\nFor appointment: (772) 794-0179\nMcCabe Clinical Eminent Scholar\nMedical Director, Center for Psychiatry and Addiction Medicine in Vero Beach\nB.A. Boston College, Boston, Massachusetts\nM.D. Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington, D.C.\nInternship: Hartford Hospital, Hartford, Connecticut\nResidency: Psychiatry, Hartford Hospital, Hartford, Connecticut\nM.M.M.

Specializing in the treatment of depression for the Treasure Coast\nWhat is Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)? TMS is a safe and highly effective treatment for adults with major depression. TMS is not a medication or medications but rather uses magnetic stimulation of the brain to improve mood. TMS uses focused magnetic impulses. The procedure was approved by the FDA in October 2008 after more than ten years of clinical investigation by Psychiatrists and other depression experts. TMS even helps patients who failed to achieve satisfactory improvement from antidepressants or have troubling side effects. How does TMS work? Depression is believed to be caused by an imbalance of chemicals in the brain, TMS helps restore balance relieving the symptoms of depression. During TMS treatment, a Psychiatrist gently places a magnet coil against one side of a patient’s scalp to non-invasively stimulate the brain in the pre-frontal cortex (region of the brain associated with mood regulation). These currents activate cells within the brain that release neurotransmitters which play a role in mood regulation. The Advantages of TMS\nTMS sessions last an hour and patients are awake and alert. During a treatment session the patient sits in a comfortable reclining chair similar to that found in a dentist’s office. A headset is applied to deliver the magnetic stimulation. You can watch TV or listen to music or relax in a comfortable chair while the magnet is working. TMS is non-invasive and requires no pre-medication, anesthesia or sedation. Because it is not a medication there are no medication risks, no interactions with other medications, no typical antidepressant side effects. TMS is a treatment that is preferred by patients who have had a partial response or failed antidepressant treatment, disliked antidepressant effects or side effects, busy work schedules, are in recovery, older, on other medications, female and considering child bearing. There are not many recognizable effects or after-effects, therefore patients return immediately to regular activity after the treatment is finished.\n\nAre you suffering from severe depression? Having complications in sleep? Depression is a simple term that began by taking stress. Stress is a result of small tensions of life, in everyone’s life we all have to face some dumps. Depression can be a very severe condition for one person and it can change your life ridiculously.

Because these symptoms are just a start after some time it will be very harmful to you. There are depression treatment centers that can help you throughout the treatment and gives you new life. Information about TMS treatment:\nWith the rise of technology in the medical field, there are so many depression treatments that are launched such as Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). In this article, we will get everything about Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. It’s the usage and the effects on you. This treatment has great effects on so many conditions. So let’s take a look at TMS quickly! - What is Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS): This depression treatment is using magnetic fields which stimulate the nerve cells which improve depression symptoms. This treatment is done after all the not working treatments of depression. In this treatment, the TMS specialist passes repetitive pulses that are magnetic. Therefore, it is also called rTMS treatment. - What is the process of TMS treatment: first of all you will be seated on the chair which should be comfortable. Than your scalp is covered by an electromagnetic coil. This treatment is fully painless. The coil transfers magnetic pulses to your brain for improving mood swings and other issues. Every expert uses some different techniques for this treatment depends upon his efficiency and understanding of the TMS. - Preparation of TMS treatment: when you select TMS treatment for you or you’re loved once then the process is started. First, you have to pass some tests of physical and Psychiatric evaluation. So that there is full safety of health during the treatment. If you have some other conditions like you are pregnant, if you have any metal device with you, or if you are taking other medications than letting the TMS specialist know about each and everything about you. - More about the procedure of treatment: this TMS treatment is not done only in one session you have to take a series of this treatment. So that it can affect your depression. This session is executed in 4 to 5 days a week. And you have to carry forward it for four and a maximum for six weeks. The first session lasts goes for 60 minutes for 1 hour. - How you will feel during treatment: you have to wear earplugs at the time of treatment with the covered head coil. You have to go through with some sounds and a tapping feeling on your head. The full treatment is done in a conscious mind you will be alert at the time of treatment.

Mental health conditions and depression are confusing and overwhelming, but the good news is that the relief is now possible as there are more advanced treatment options available than ever before to help you live a healthy life. Depression generally leads to isolation from the friends and family, and an only medical professional can provide the necessary help. Most often, medication and talk therapy help decrease depression, but those with major depressive disorder or treatment-resistant depression need to try multiple medications or advanced therapies like TMS. TMS is a non-invasive and drug-free therapy prescribed for patients who suffer from MDD and don’t respond well to medication. TMS delivers electromagnetic pulses to the pre-frontal cortex that regulates mood and stimulate cortical neurons to relieve the depression symptoms. Approximately 50-60% of people suffering from depression who have tried and failed to benefit from medications, witness full remission with TMS. In 2008, FDA cleared TMS for treating depression, and it is administered in sessions that generally last for 30-40 minutes, five times a week over 4-6 weeks. No sedation or anesthesia is given to the patients; therefore, they can resume their usual activities right after their session. Repeated treatment encourages the formation of new circuits providing relief to the patients. Unlike depression medications, TMS is not associated with systemic side effects that are caused by the passage of drugs through the bloodstream. Only reported side effect of TMS is mild-to-moderate discomfort caused by the electromagnetic pulses. Some of the common side effects include:\n2. Spasms, tingling, and twitching of the facial muscles\n3. Discomfort in the scalp at the site of stimulation\nYou can ask the doctor to adjust the stimulation level to reduce the symptoms if you experience painful scalp sensation or facial twitching. Or can take over-the-counter pain medication and tend to lessen over the course of treatmen1t. There is minimal risk of seizure. To ensure that you are eligible for TMS a physical examination and psychiatric evolution to discuss depression is done. The evaluation helps you make sure that TMS is safe and a good option. TMS is not safe in the following conditions:\nYou are pregnant or planning to get pregnant\nThere is an implanted medical device in the body\nYou have a history of seizures\nThere is brain damage from past injury or illness\nYou suffer from frequent headaches\nTo ensure you get the best treatment, it is suggested to look for a well-reputed clinic. Getting the treatment from experienced practitioners and healthcare providers will ensure exceptional comfort and minimum side effects. Before you start the therapy, make an appointment and see if you are comfortable with them, and you feel calm at the clinic. Also, check whether the clinic accepts health insurance as most health insurance companies these days cover TMS treatment.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:006fbb26-e254-4535-8f97-45999dcce05e>"]},{"passage":"A therapist helps patients identify their triggers and develop healthy coping mechanisms to prevent future episodes. How does TMS help alleviate depression? TMS uses non-invasive electromagnetic energy to stimulate the brain. Research on TMS and depression have found that the electromagnetic pulses, when applied to depressed areas of the brain, activates neurons thought to be responsible for depression symptoms. Why would someone choose TMS Along with medication? Medications are often the first line of defense in treating depression. Most patients will respond favorably to antidepressants. However, sometimes people need additional help. TMS can help those who are experiencing treatment-resistant depression. Also, medications can come with a range of side effects and other issues. Some of the most common side effects of antidepressants are weight gain, stomach upset, dry mouth, drowsiness, and sexual dysfunction. When receiving TMS, it’s important to also work with your mental healthcare professional on finding the right medications for you. For patients who don’t respond to medications or therapy as well as they’d hoped, TMS may be the right choice for them. If you or a loved one are struggling with depression episodes that aren’t going away, contact Pulse TMS.

It also has far fewer side effects than antidepressant medication, which can lead to weight gain and high blood pressure. TMS for Bipolar Disorder\nTMS can be an effective treatment for symptoms of bipolar disorder as it can increase the excitability of brain activity in the target area of the brain, improving symptoms of depression. While studies have found that it may induce manic or hypomanic symptoms through stimulation, almost all bipolar disorder treatments carry this risk. TMS for Teens and Kids\nMood disorders like depression are widespread among children and teens across the world. Inadequate treatment can lead to conduct disorders, illness, poor performance at school, and a greater risk of suicide. The good news is that depression in teens is treatable and can open the doors to the future they dream of. TMS therapy can be an effective treatment for young people with depression, and the procedure's minimal side effects and accessibility make it an attractive option for young people who may want to fit TMS treatment alongside their work or studies. What Is Deep TMS Therapy? Deep TMS therapy is a form of TMS therapy that uses special combinations of coils. These coils produce electromagnetic pulses that reach below the surface of the skull, and different coils are used to reach each brain region. The FDA has approved deep TMS with the 'H1' coil for the treatment of people with treatment-resistant depression who have not responded to psychotherapy or medicine. How Much Does TMS Therapy Cost? TMS therapy can be one of the most cost-effective treatments for depression and other medical conditions. Many insurance providers cover TMS therapy under certain conditions. We accept a number of insurances as well as have payment options. To get more information contact us. We are available 24 hours a day. Is TMS Treatment the Same As Shock Therapy? Electroshock therapy (ECT) involves applying electrical currents directly to the client's head when they are sedated by anesthesia. While it can lead to short-term cognitive improvements, it is an invasive procedure that may require someone to take a break from work and home responsibilities. On the other hand, TMS therapy is non-invasive, passing electromagnetic currents through the skull. It is completely pain-free and has few side effects other than a temporary mild headache or skull discomfort. Who Should Avoid TMS Treatment? Clients who have permanent metal implants in their heads other than dental braces or fillings should not receive TMS therapy. The electromagnetic signals could cause these implants to heat up, move, or function incorrectly, risking injury or death. Implants that prevent a client from participating in TMS therapy include:\n- Deep brain stimulators\n- Aneurysm coils or clips\n- Tattoos on the face with metallic or magnetic ink\n- Electrodes that monitor brain activity\n- Any other metal medical devices or objects in or near the head\nThose considering TMS treatment should also speak with a doctor if they:\n- Take any medication\n- Have a history of seizures\n- Have a family history of epilepsy\n- Live with co-occurring mental disorders\n- Have a brain injury\n- Have had other medical conditions\n- Have previously been treated with TMS\n- Are pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant\nWhat Are the Side-Effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation? Side effects of TMS treatment are usually mild to moderate and improve soon after each session. They also tend to decrease as clients participate in sessions throughout their treatment. Common side effects may include:\n- Scalp discomfort\n- Tingling, spasms, or twitching of facial muscles\n- Lightheadedness or dizziness\nThough these side effects are mild, doctors may be able to reduce them by adjusting the intensity of the magnetic fields. There is currently not enough evidence regarding the long-term side effects of TMS treatment. Mental Wellness Treatment and Neurodiversity - TMS Therapy Near Me\nNeurodiversity refers to the difference between the parts of the brain that impact the way people socialize, learn, feel, and behave. Neurodiversity supports the view that when a brain functions differently, it is not a disability or an illness that needs to be treated. Instead, those struggling should think about adapting their social structures to accommodate their differences.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:9e04444c-5363-4493-b522-4b325d58cec3>"]},{"passage":"Commonly asked questions about Transcranila Magnetic Stimlation (TMS) answered by Dr. Daniel Press, Director, TMS Clinical Program at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center:\nWhat is TMS? TMS stands for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. It uses magnetic fields to induce a current in specific brain areas and thus stimulate or suppress brain activity. Using TMS allows doctors to change brain activity without surgery and with minimal discomfort to the patient. TMS has been used to treat a variety of disorders including migraines, stroke, Parkinson's disease and depression. Who is a good candidate for TMS for depression? In 2009, the Food and Drug Administration approved the NeuroStar TMS Therapy system for treatment of people with major depressive disorder who haven't seen satisfactory improvement from medication. As with any treatment option, you and your doctor should discuss if TMS therapy is right for you. What are the sessions like and how many are needed? During each TMS session, patients sit comfortably in a chair. The stimulation coil (wand) is held just above the head, targeting magnetic pulses to a 2-3 centimeter area of a specific area of the brain. The nature of the magnetic fields allows them to pass through the patient's hair, skin and skull and into the mood-regulating area without being distorted in any way. Patients do not require anesthesia or sedation. In the brain, these magnetic pulses produce small electrical currents. The electricity created in the brain cannot be felt by the patient, but is sufficient to change the activity of brain cells. Applied repeatedly, these magnetic pulses modify the activity of the targeted brain area and can thus help the brain overcome the dysfunction associated with depression. Treatments last for about 40 minutes and occur every day for a period of several weeks. Is it safe? TMS is a safe treatment for depression if appropriate guidelines are followed. In more than 10,000 treatments administered in clinical studies, the most common side effect was mild-to-moderate scalp pain or discomfort at the treatment area, which declined \"markedly after the first week.\" Fewer than 5 percent of patients stopped treatment due to adverse effects. There is a very small risk of seizure - about the same risk as when taking medications to treat depression. Does it work? In clinical studies involving hundreds of people with major depressive disorder, significant improvement was recorded for symptoms of core depression, anxiety, and other forms of psychological distress. In most patients, benefits lasted through the 6-month study follow-up period. While NeuroStar TMS Therapy has been proven effective, not all patients will benefit. Patients should be carefully monitored for worsening symptoms. Will my insurance cover it? While the treatment was recently FDA approved, not all insurance companies yet cover the treatments.

In general this has not been a problem when administering TMS to patients volunteering for research studies. How long does a treatment session last? It depends on the research protocol, but generally each session takes about a half an hour. One procedure includes 2 daily sessions approximately 20 minutes each, with a 30-minute break between them. It is performed for 10 days, with a rest period of 2 days between the first 5 days and the second 5 days. There are 20 sessions in total. How many times do you need to receive TMS? Research protocols vary in the treatment duration, but most require at least two weeks of daily stimulation given five times per week, some require up to 6 weeks. Are there any side-effects or risks associated with TMS? Yes. The main risk of TMS, as with any pulsed energy, is inducing a seizure, though with close monitoring this complication has been very rare. No seizures have been reported in the scientific literature since safety guidelines have been implemented. For stimulation at low frequency (1 to 5 pulses per second) there have been no reports of seizures. Insofar as the brain is directly stimulated by TMS, there is a potential risk of disturbing the brain’s normal functions. However, in depression studies reported so far, no cognitive side-effects like loss of memory, negative changes in concentration and other cognitive capacities have been reported. This is in stark contract to the well known cognitive side effects associated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Is TMS widely available to patients in the U.S. and Canada? TMS is not yet FDA cleared but has been approved in Canada and can be purchased from Biophysica. Why are researchers evaluating TMS? TMS has some very unique properties. It is non-invasive, (does not break the skin and can be delivered in a physician’s office) can easily be focused on small areas of the brain, and can change brain activity. This makes it particularly well suited for treating the brain, while minimizing side effects typical with other psychiatric treatments which affect areas of the brain and body not involved in the disorder. Specifically for major depression, researchers understand there are a significant number of patients suffering from this disorder that are not helped by the available medications and other therapies, only receive partial benefit, or are not able to take medications at all. TMS offers hope that, if proven effective, many of these patients may be able to experience symptom relief. Reviewed by Stanford Miller, July 2004\nTMS is used in many different areas of research and therapeutics including:\nCognitive Neuroscience - in the investigation of learning, memory, creativity, speech, hearing, visual, perception and functional connection\nPsychiatry - to influence specific brain function within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex To relieve anxiety, depression, bulemia (bulimia), schizophrenia and depersonalization as a better alternative to Electric Shock Treatment also called ECT.

An initial assessment by Dr. Creelman will determine the appropriate dose of the magnetic pulse and the exact area of the brain the magnet should activate. Patients typically receive 20 – 30 treatments over four to six weeks. There may also be a taper phase. During the TMS treatment the patient is monitored to ensure correct positioning and comfort level. More patients in the most recent clinical studies who failed one antidepressant trial succeeded with TMS than any second antidepressant or therapy. Are There Risks and Side Effects with TMS? More than 10,000 treatments were safely performed just during clinical trials. Patient reported no side effects like those associated with antidepressant medication (weight gain, dry mouth, drowsiness, etc. ), no seizures and no cognitive side effects (memory loss, ability to concentrate). Scalp discomfort during the procedure is the most common side effect. TMS should not be used for patients with implanted metallic devices that include metal plates in the skull or aneurysm coils, clips or stents. Special precautions are recommended for individuals with implants such as pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators. Is TMS covered by insurance? Both private and public (Medicare and Medicaid) insurers determine eligibility for TMS on an individual basis. Patients should work directly with their insurers to receive approval for TMS.

While symptoms vary from one person to the next, there are some common signs of depression in veterans you can look out for:\n- Feeling sad or hopeless\n- Disinterest in life’s activities\n- Gaining or losing weight\n- Excessive or difficulty sleeping\n- Feeling lethargic\n- Feeling guilty\n- Problems in relationships with others\nIf you experience symptoms of PTSD and depression, you could also be experiencing anxiety—a study by Ginzburg et al showed that cases of PTSD, anxiety, and depression in veterans were more common than cases of PTSD by itself or a combination of PTSD and anxiety. It can be difficult to pay attention to your feelings and ask yourself why you are feeling a certain way, but it’s important to understand what you’re going through after your service to figure out how to treat potential problems. If you find that you experience these symptoms following your deployment, it’s important to allow yourself to feel what you’re going through and rely on the comfort of loved ones to help you work through it. It is normal to feel out of sync with people around you soon after you get home, but that will ease with time. Should all of this become too much for you to handle, don’t hesitate to seek professional help. There is no reason to feel ashamed to do so, because so many others who served in combat share that experience. Depression is a treatable condition. TMS Therapy for Veteran Depression\nAccording to a 2017 study by Mi et al, veterans may respond differently to treatment for major depressive disorder than the average civilian. Compared to others, the veteran population showed a greater proportion of those who were not efficiently responding to pharmacological and psychotherapy treatment. When a patient doesn’t improve with psychotherapy and antidepressant medication—having tried at least two antidepressants at the appropriate doses—then they may be suffering from treatment resistant depression (TRD). The FDA recently approved the use of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Therapy (TMS), a safe and noninvasive treatment method, for treating veterans with TRD. At Transformations, we use NeuroStar, a brand of TMS that specializes in targeting under-active brain areas associated with depression. In addition to being noninvasive, NeuroStar is non-systemic, meaning that because it is not consumed orally, NeuroStar does not course through the body in the bloodstream. During a treatment session, the TMS technician or physician will place a magnetic coil on your head in order to administer magnetic pulses to the targeted brain areas. Side effects are minimal compared to those of antidepressants, so no more nausea, weight gain, or dizziness. Treatment is largely painless (some patients experience a headache following a treatment session, but those can be helped with over the counter pain relievers and eventually subside over the course of treatment). TMS is not the same as electroconvulsive (shock) therapy. Treatment sessions last anywhere from 20-50 minutes and administered five days a week for five to six weeks. You will be fully wake for the procedure—and because there’s no anesthesia administration, patients are able to drive themselves home following a treatment session. If you or a loved one are a veteran suffering from depression following combat, speak to a medical professional about treatment. If it is a true medical emergency, please call 911. In addition to reaching out to your physician or a mental health professional, there is a Veteran Crisis Line that offers free support 24\/7. Call 1-800-273-8255 and press 1, chat online, or text 838255. It is not uncommon for veterans to suffer from conditions such as PTSD and depression following combat, so there’s no need to believe your feelings are invalid and that you will just work through it. If you have tried antidepressants and psychotherapy alone, talk to a medical professional about a prescription for TMS therapy at Transformations.

At GIA Chicago, our treatment programs accommodate neurodiversity. We recognize that neurodiverse clients may experience conditions and respond to treatments differently. Our experts consider neurodiversity when designing treatment plans which may include TMS therapy. What Is the Success Rate of TMS Therapy? The success rate of TMS therapy depends on the medical conditions it is being used to treat. For many conditions, scientists need to do more research to determine accurate rates. However, the evidence so far is very promising. Research has shown that up to 62% of people living with depression experience complete remission, meaning that they no longer experience any symptoms of depression. Other studies have found that symptoms of anxiety improve by 33%. How Many Sessions Does It Take for TMS to Work? Every client is different. Some clients may notice small changes in a standard course of TMS after one to two weeks (5 - 10 sessions), while others start to see improvements in the fourth or fifth week (20 - 25 sessions). It's recommended that clients complete an entire course of treatment regardless of when they first see improvements. Is TMS Painful? Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a relatively painless procedure that can be a lifeline for clients struggling with their mental wellness. It is a safe and non-invasive procedure with fewer side effects than other treatment options. Will TMS Work for Me? Many people try TMS when other treatment methods do not work. It can be a life-changing experience, with two-thirds of people achieving complete remission after treatment. But it is important to note that the TMS experience does not work for everyone. Contact us today to learn more about TMS and discuss whether it is the best alternative treatment method for you. Can TMS Make You Worse? There is no evidence that Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation can worsen symptoms of any condition the treatment is often prescribed for. However, it is possible that for people with certain conditions, TMS is not a viable treatment and they may experience negative effects. Clinical studies of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder show mixed results. Can TMS Damage Your Brain? TMS is entirely non-invasive. Therefore it does not require any form of surgery or the implantation of electrodes. There is no evidence that TMS treatments damage the brain in any way, as long as a person has been confirmed a suitable candidate for TMS by their primary care physician, TMS provider, or other qualified doctors. What does TMS Therapy feel like? The physical sensations experienced by patients during a treatment session are like moderate tapping or knocking on the skull, caused by the magnetic pulses generated by the TMS machine. While few patients would describe TMS as actually pleasant, it is not uncommon for people to doze off during treatment, and even those who enjoy it least would most likely describe it as unpleasant rather than painful. Can TMS Change Your Personality? TMS cannot fundamentally change your personality, either temporarily or permanently. By alleviating symptoms of major depression and other mental health concerns, TMS may lead to significant changes in mood and behavior. However, rather than changing your personality, TMS helps you reconnect with your inner-self, rediscover your passions, and express yourself to the full. How Long Does TMS Therapy Last? A typical course of TMS therapy consists of daily sessions for six to nine weeks. Some providers may reduce the frequency of sessions towards the end of the TMS treatment process, while others may offer twice-daily sessions. Most TMS sessions last from 20-40 minutes. Your first treatment session, known as the mapping session, is usually a little longer. How Long Does It Take for TMS to Start Working? There is significant variation in the time it takes for clients to experience the first improvements. While some clients notice results in the first week, others may see changes in the fourth or fifth week. If you notice improvements later than other people, this does not mean that the treatment is ineffective. Is TMS Treatment Safe? TMS is a safe, non-invasive treatment that is FDA-approved for major depression. TMS also has very few side effects than other treatment methods like antidepressant medications. The most common side-effects of TMS treatment are mild to moderate scalp discomfort at the treatment site and temporary headaches at the end of a session.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:9e04444c-5363-4493-b522-4b325d58cec3>"]},{"passage":"Wayne Creelman, M.D. – Depression and Psychiatry Treatment\nFor appointment: (772) 794-0179\nMcCabe Clinical Eminent Scholar\nMedical Director, Center for Psychiatry and Addiction Medicine in Vero Beach\nB.A. Boston College, Boston, Massachusetts\nM.D. Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington, D.C.\nInternship: Hartford Hospital, Hartford, Connecticut\nResidency: Psychiatry, Hartford Hospital, Hartford, Connecticut\nM.M.M.

Specializing in the treatment of depression for the Treasure Coast\nWhat is Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)? TMS is a safe and highly effective treatment for adults with major depression. TMS is not a medication or medications but rather uses magnetic stimulation of the brain to improve mood. TMS uses focused magnetic impulses. The procedure was approved by the FDA in October 2008 after more than ten years of clinical investigation by Psychiatrists and other depression experts. TMS even helps patients who failed to achieve satisfactory improvement from antidepressants or have troubling side effects. How does TMS work? Depression is believed to be caused by an imbalance of chemicals in the brain, TMS helps restore balance relieving the symptoms of depression. During TMS treatment, a Psychiatrist gently places a magnet coil against one side of a patient’s scalp to non-invasively stimulate the brain in the pre-frontal cortex (region of the brain associated with mood regulation). These currents activate cells within the brain that release neurotransmitters which play a role in mood regulation. The Advantages of TMS\nTMS sessions last an hour and patients are awake and alert. During a treatment session the patient sits in a comfortable reclining chair similar to that found in a dentist’s office. A headset is applied to deliver the magnetic stimulation. You can watch TV or listen to music or relax in a comfortable chair while the magnet is working. TMS is non-invasive and requires no pre-medication, anesthesia or sedation. Because it is not a medication there are no medication risks, no interactions with other medications, no typical antidepressant side effects. TMS is a treatment that is preferred by patients who have had a partial response or failed antidepressant treatment, disliked antidepressant effects or side effects, busy work schedules, are in recovery, older, on other medications, female and considering child bearing. There are not many recognizable effects or after-effects, therefore patients return immediately to regular activity after the treatment is finished.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e25f02b7-65b8-4125-a691-d0c416c80689>"]},{"passage":"Are you suffering from severe depression?

In this article, we will get everything about Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. It’s the usage and the effects on you. This treatment has great effects on so many conditions. So let’s take a look at TMS quickly! - What is Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS): This depression treatment is using magnetic fields which stimulate the nerve cells which improve depression symptoms. This treatment is done after all the not working treatments of depression. In this treatment, the TMS specialist passes repetitive pulses that are magnetic. Therefore, it is also called rTMS treatment. - What is the process of TMS treatment: first of all you will be seated on the chair which should be comfortable. Than your scalp is covered by an electromagnetic coil. This treatment is fully painless. The coil transfers magnetic pulses to your brain for improving mood swings and other issues. Every expert uses some different techniques for this treatment depends upon his efficiency and understanding of the TMS. - Preparation of TMS treatment: when you select TMS treatment for you or you’re loved once then the process is started. First, you have to pass some tests of physical and Psychiatric evaluation. So that there is full safety of health during the treatment. If you have some other conditions like you are pregnant, if you have any metal device with you, or if you are taking other medications than letting the TMS specialist know about each and everything about you. - More about the procedure of treatment: this TMS treatment is not done only in one session you have to take a series of this treatment. So that it can affect your depression. This session is executed in 4 to 5 days a week. And you have to carry forward it for four and a maximum for six weeks. The first session lasts goes for 60 minutes for 1 hour. - How you will feel during treatment: you have to wear earplugs at the time of treatment with the covered head coil. You have to go through with some sounds and a tapping feeling on your head. The full treatment is done in a conscious mind you will be alert at the time of treatment. After or during the treatment you will also feel some discomfort in the scalp. depression treatment centers offer full safety:\nWith the availability of technical resources and good experts so many treatment centers providing this. If you really want a good effect on your mind than first make sure yourself about your mind need it or not. After taking tests and perfect research than go for beginning the treatment otherwise it can be harmful to you. Depression not only affects your life but also your family and friends also suffer from it. You can feel the improvement partially or completely. The relief from all the symptoms needs 4 to 5 weeks of continuous sessions. When you complete the session you have to take some outgoing treatment for a few weeks to make sure that now you are stress-free. And if you suffer from the same symptoms after some days than you have to start again this TMS treatment but the claims are paid by depression treatment insurance company not by you.

Cole ruffled a few purple hairs with the finale track of his newly released KOD album, 1985 (Intro to ‘The Fall Off’). Some clumsily labeled the record a “diss” track at the millennial rap generation, namely Lil Pump: the 17-year-old Miami rapper who dropped an unprovoked “F**k J. Cole” diss song. But it’s actually a page from Cole’s 33-year-old book of wisdom that he was generous enough to share with the emerging rap generation beneath him without needing to resort to a “diss” record. However, according to Coke Boys founder French Montana, “every generation of hip-hop” is to be respected. The South Bronx native spoke with LA Weekly after a question about hip-hop enthusiasts who “hate” on Lil Pump. French said that he loves what the rapper is doing for the rap game, though it isn’t clear what that specifically is. “I love what Tupac and Biggie did for the game, I also love what Run-DMC and them did for the game,” he continued. “I just feel like the game just changes.” The “Unforgettable” rapper championed the financially elevated lifestyle rap has afforded artists in this day and age as it “just shows growth.” Without name-dropping anyone, French believes that anyone who doesn’t like Pump shouldn’t listen to him, anyway, especially since there are still lyrical artists existing in the current state of rap. “Whatever kind of rap you want to listen to, go listen to it,” he said. “I love Lil Pump’s music.” As aforementioned, French doesn't specifically name anyone, but also doesn’t speak much to Pump’s shots at Cole which—if anyone could take a wild guess—might presumably stem from not appreciating or liking the Dreamville leader as a “lyrical” artist.

What is hip hop? “Hip Hop is still fundamentally an art form that traffics in hyperbole, parody, kitsch, dramatic license, double entendres, signification, and other literary and artistic conventions to get its point across.” Michael Eric Dyson, scholar (Dyson 2007: xvii)\n“Hip-Hop does not make it exceptionally endearing to me by the attitude that the menfolk have towards the women. It’s very difficult to hold your head up with dignity when guys are looking at you like you just some b*tch or a hoe. It’s not exactly a fun kind of subculture for the women. It’s all good for the men that get to be machismo and posture and strut about, that’s all good. But the ladies…it’s very hard.” Lady Pink, graffiti writer (quoted in Aqua)\n“Hip-hop was born in New York City in the mid-1970s as a vehicle for inner-city youth to throw parties on their blocks and at area clubs, and for them to make money as DJs and promoters.” Kevin Powell, writer (Powell)\n“According to one ex-high Satanist, it is identical with the voodoo chants and rituals used within Satanism to summon up demons of lust and violence.” Jack Chick, Battle Cry newspaper (Small 1992: 4)\n“Hip and Hop is more than musicHip is the knowledgeHop is the movementHip and Hop is intelligent movement” KRS-One and Marley Marl lyrics to song “Hip Hop Lives”\n“Hip-hop, everybody’s allowed to come in it, because it’s a street thing. I heard someone say, ‘Frank Ocean hip-hop artist.’ He is, hip-hop loves Frank Ocean, he’s our brother, but [he’s not a hip-hop artist]. Miguel is not a hip-hop artist. Trey Songz is not a hip-hop artist. They’re singers.” Nas (Bené Viera)\n” Hip Hop music is made from black, brown, yellow, red, white—whatever music that gives you the grunt, that funk, that groove or that beat. It’s all part of hip hop.” Afrika Bambaataa, DJ (Davy D)\n“Hip-hop is about youth and the young at heart.” Kool Herc, DJ (Mao 2013: 66)\nPart 2: Drawing on 2-4 of the definitions provided above and chapters 1-5 of our text book Rap and Hip Hop Culture (New York: Oxford University Press, 2015) complete the following 4 steps which contain strict guidelines and some (semi-open ended) questions to develop an argument to help you explain the different ideas community members and media critics have about “hip hop.”\n(0-5 points) In one paragraph, set your tone and inform your reader that you are about to address the complex and inconsistent ways “we” have defined and misused the terms “hip hop” and “rap.” Can you do it in an interesting way to draw a reader to continue reading your work? Required elements:\nFocus on 2-4 examples as opposed to responding to every definition on the list. What background information does your reader need to know in order to understand your claim? (example: why it is necessary to address definitions. Or how key terms are used and abused. Or …)\nWho does “we” represent? Your last sentence should be your claim. (0-7.5 points) In following 2-3 paragraphs, problematize(to view as a problem to solve) a couple of the definitions. Introduce your evidence to prove your claim. NOTE: Your opinion alone is not sufficient. Instead, you must draw on the other definitions from this group to help support your argument and draw on the data from your text book and\/or you may draw on other academically sound materials and include that source in your WORKS CITED page. (0-5 points) In the following paragraph, anticipate a counterargument or counterarguments: What might a reader pose against your argument or your reasoning? Recognize your own biases: I am young and a current fan of hip hop culture. OR I am an older fan and perhaps romanticize the past too much. OR I am male and might ignore the ways it has impacted female participants.\n\nThis interview took place on June 24th. This is the third interview I’ve ever done, and I think it’s the best one I’ve done so far. If you haven’t checked out my review of (((echo chamber))), you’re fuckin’ up. Shoutout to Mello Music Group for putting it out. Hello, good sir. Would you be interested in doing an interview for Focus Hip Hop? “Excitement.” How many languages have you tried to learn? Only a few. Wish I knew them all. The most helpful thing I learned in the hospital was body language. How did you get a citation in the Oxford English Dictionary. I was recognized for an accomplishment; pretty straightforward. How do you speak body language? Emotions. “Acting.” When did you overcome nerves? Does anyone ever? It appears that way to many? We’re asking too many deep questions. Which acting gestures did you have to be taught or relearn? Believe the message. “I know everything.”\nOkay, so these things apply to ALL gestures slash communicaziones. Let’s do a collaborative illustration for this interview. Good idea. I’ll draw my words. What are the most boring compliments you receive? I can’t complain about compliments, but I will say this. My old friend Brian Gibson once said, “People will like you for the wrong reasons. That’s something you’ll have to deal with.” No idea what he meant at the time, but mind blowing soon after. Understandable. Who’s your favorite writer? What kind of work does he write? Novels, poetry, and anthologies. Who’s your favorite writer? He writes at top levels in so many formats. It’s incredible. He’s who I aspire to be. Okay, I want to add George Carlin to my list. Prophetic. And Lao Tzu. Important names are being said. None more important than you, DJ Phocus. I appreciate that. Confidence is lacking by most people my age. Why and how do you know that’s true? I’m mentally ill.\nYou’re not alone in that, but are you generalizing that your generation is too? Funny. You’re smart. What did you think of (((Age War)))? Didn’t experience one. What is it? It’s on my album! For what it’s worth, I felt that way as a kid before you were born, so there goes the generation gap. “Thanksgiving.” Do you philosophize? You mean philosophize about thanksgiving? In general, what are the hardest questions to which you search for answers? 1. Can we instill values without religion? 2. How do we get rid of money? 3. Can I be a great dad & a great artist at the same time? 4. How do we prepare for climate collapse? 5. How do I bring people closer to oneness? 6. You got any answers for those? 7. Should I follow up Re-Thankskilling? 1. Doubted by most. 2. Be manipulative. 3. Yes. 4. Study Earth. 5. Role models. 6. Everyone has an “answer.” 7. Depends on inspiration. Just try your best. Any trauma in your life? Elaborate. Never mind, that’s kind of a rude command. Define “horror.” Personally…\nJeez, that sounds terrible for everyone involved. I stumbled on an article last night about greater mental health problems generally in younger generations. Hard to believe it’s not all pervasive, but I guess I really don’t know. Anyway, I have to wrap up this interview, DJ Phocus. Thanks for reaching out!!! Of course. Thank you for your participation. Yo. I would like to apologize for being resistant to the idea that mental illness is only getting worse. I actually know it is, but wanted to pretend otherwise so I could be less scared for my kids. Don’t worry, man. I understand. if you don't share this article i will hunt you down\n\nI have come to the conclusion that there can be no conclusion to my unit on the evolution of rap music in the united states because rap music is still in a state of evolution this book is an excellent source on the history of rap music that can be used by both teachers and students.

Mike McGuire, both an artist and student of the genre, talked hip-hop last week at Mount Allison. McGuire is a recent graduate of Mount Saint Vincent University, whose time there culminated in a thesis on the history of hip-hop in Halifax; his talk outlined the genre’s rise and fall from its beginnings in the Bronx through its Golden Age in the nineties and ended with discussion of the genre’s current state. McGuire’s talk began with a discussion of the influences of hip-hop, in which he specifically mentioned the talking blues and West African music. Due mention was also given to the influence of poetry on the genre, and with nods to Gil Scott Heron and the Last Poets, McGuire detailed how these influences mixed in the Bronx. To set the scene, he talked about Robert Moses’ push for urban renewal by the city of New York in 1972, which saw massive construction projects in the Bronx. The Cross Bronx Expressway displaced millions in an effort to make the city more accessible to the suburbs. The result: property values plummeted, half a million jobs were lost, and youth unemployment spiked to eighty per cent. Four blocks a week were lost to fire throughout the decade because it was more profitable for landlords to lose their property and collect insurance than to maintain it. It was a place where people had to make their own fun, giving rise to many hip-hop related activities. Together these allowed the community to come together around music by converging in parks, stealing power, and putting on massive shows. After adding the caveat that this was only a history, and not the history, of hip-hop, he outlined the first advancements of hip-hop in the field of DJing. From DJ Kool Herc’s stringing the break beats of songs together to Grandmaster Flash’s clocking technique, the sound developed over the course of twenty years. McGuire discussed how, unlike preceding genres that became cultural touchstones, such as rock-‘n’-roll or jazz, hip-hop stayed largely true to itself and remained politically charged. As Chuck D famously said, “Rap is black America’s TV station. It gives a whole perspective about what exists and what black life is.”\nHowever, as rap became part of the mainstream its principle began to shift, the genre becoming more and more dominated by the themes and sounds of West Coast gangster rap. McGuire ended his talk on that note, opening up the floor for discussion. In these discussions, more controversial topics such as the direction and focus of contemporary hip-hop were brought up, including its focus on money and its attitudes toward women. McGuire is a rapper and producer himself, releasing albums and contributions to other projects under the moniker Hermitofthewoods. He is also an avid slam poet who has competed on the national stage, and a resident judge for The Elements League, which is part of a rap battle circuit. The talk was a planned part of the university’s celebration of Black History Month, some of which is now occurring during the month of March due to complications arising as a result of the strike.\n\nHHD: You have always loved music.

Your background, age, experiences, or education may give you a head start in some styles, but don't let that stop you from becoming adept at lyric genres with which you have had limited experience. Just as an actor can learn an accent or develop a character for a movie part, you can learn a new lyrical style and expand the kinds of songs you are capable of writing.Pop Lyrics\nModern pop lyrics are usually either trendy or timeless. Last year's slang will do you as much good as a pair of parachute pants. If you don't know what parachute pants are, they were a form of clothing that was extremely popular for about a year (or fifteen minutes, depending on where you lived) and then, quite suddenly, no one would be caught dead in them. Is “pop” really a genre? Pop is short for “popular.” What's popular changes from time to time. Pop lyrics and music tend to be highly accessible versions of whatever the popular genres are at a given time. A rock, hip-hop, or country song can be a pop song, if enough people get it. Trendy lyrics aim at the teen market (which buys the most CDs and has the newest, coolest slang terms). Examples of trendy lyrics include the Avril Lavigne song “Sk8er Boi” or, for its time, The Beach Boys classic “I Get Around.”\nLyrics in the timeless style must not only transcend barriers of time, but also economic status, ethnicity, and geography. Tough? Yes! Worth it? You bet! A timeless song can keep royalty checks coming for the rest of your life and beyond. A list of timeless lyrics might include “Unforgettable,” “Evergreen,” “Crazy,” and “Freebird.” Simple elegance and natural flow define the timeless lyric. Pop lyrics can be about most subjects, but love and relationships are the all-time big sellers. A pop lyric should be accessible to a large market so, aside from the newest “teenspeak,” try to avoid language that's regionally or demographically specific.Rock and Alt\nA good rock lyric is emotionally charged, dynamic, and forceful. Rock is about energy, so think powerful, think active, think passionate, and rock on! General rock topics include feeling boxed in, rebellion, wanting to have fun, passion, comeuppance, and angst or depression. Most rock lyrics have a tight, rhythmic meter and are easy to follow. This doesn't mean writing for third graders, it means getting to the point. Alt songs may be deeper, moodier, or more meditative and cover a broader range of subjects in addition to the general rock topics. In rock or alt, an uptempo danceable song or a love ballad that isn't too wimpy will usually be where the money is. Be careful with lyrics that deal with rebellion, angst, or depression. You wouldn't want your song to be unfairly blamed for a riot or a suicide. When dealing with these subjects and emotions, use an approach that let's the listener know he or she is not alone in feeling a certain way. Country songwriting has expanded to include other musical forms. It's the level of lyric writing and storytelling that sets country apart. Many great country songs have been based on stories the songwriter heard as a child from family or friends. Established country songwriters also recommend reading short stories and watching movies, sitcoms, talk shows, or news stories to get story ideas. Modern country lyrics cover many topics, so there's no need to start writing stories about cows and whiskey and cheating spouses; Nashville has more than enough of those already. Hallmarks of a modern country lyric are a conversational tone, a sense of humor, and reinforcement of basic values like hard work, faith, and honesty.Jazz and Rap\nWhile numerous and wonderful exceptions occur, jazz is usually more about the melody and the sound of the words than the actual lyric. Not that you can't have a great lyric in a jazz song, but make the melody and meter top priority. Pay careful attention to vowel sounds in a jazz lyric. Jazz treats the voice like an instrument and vowels influence the tone of the voice. Because of its droning, nonstandard melodic forms, rap requires very close attention to meter and rhyme.\n\nWell, we can't forget the past of jazz because it will take you to the future in music, but innovation and evolution is essential and we must give the right message to the up coming generations.What is in the near future? I'm concentrating in growing up as a musician and focusing on my project to build my space in the music industry and to develop my career.If I weren't a jazz musician, I would be a:\nI don't know.\n\nQ.

What is hip hop? “Hip Hop is still fundamentally an art form that traffics in hyperbole, parody, kitsch, dramatic license, double entendres, signification, and other literary and artistic conventions to get its point across.” Michael Eric Dyson, scholar (Dyson 2007: xvii)\n“Hip-Hop does not make it exceptionally endearing to me by the attitude that the menfolk have towards the women. It’s very difficult to hold your head up with dignity when guys are looking at you like you just some b*tch or a hoe. It’s not exactly a fun kind of subculture for the women. It’s all good for the men that get to be machismo and posture and strut about, that’s all good. But the ladies…it’s very hard.” Lady Pink, graffiti writer (quoted in Aqua)\n“Hip-hop was born in New York City in the mid-1970s as a vehicle for inner-city youth to throw parties on their blocks and at area clubs, and for them to make money as DJs and promoters.” Kevin Powell, writer (Powell)\n“According to one ex-high Satanist, it is identical with the voodoo chants and rituals used within Satanism to summon up demons of lust and violence.” Jack Chick, Battle Cry newspaper (Small 1992: 4)\n“Hip and Hop is more than musicHip is the knowledgeHop is the movementHip and Hop is intelligent movement” KRS-One and Marley Marl lyrics to song “Hip Hop Lives”\n“Hip-hop, everybody’s allowed to come in it, because it’s a street thing. I heard someone say, ‘Frank Ocean hip-hop artist.’ He is, hip-hop loves Frank Ocean, he’s our brother, but [he’s not a hip-hop artist]. Miguel is not a hip-hop artist. Trey Songz is not a hip-hop artist. They’re singers.” Nas (Bené Viera)\n” Hip Hop music is made from black, brown, yellow, red, white—whatever music that gives you the grunt, that funk, that groove or that beat. It’s all part of hip hop.” Afrika Bambaataa, DJ (Davy D)\n“Hip-hop is about youth and the young at heart.” Kool Herc, DJ (Mao 2013: 66)\nPart 2: Drawing on 2-4 of the definitions provided above and chapters 1-5 of our text book Rap and Hip Hop Culture (New York: Oxford University Press, 2015) complete the following 4 steps which contain strict guidelines and some (semi-open ended) questions to develop an argument to help you explain the different ideas community members and media critics have about “hip hop.”\n(0-5 points) In one paragraph, set your tone and inform your reader that you are about to address the complex and inconsistent ways “we” have defined and misused the terms “hip hop” and “rap.” Can you do it in an interesting way to draw a reader to continue reading your work?

This is the third interview I’ve ever done, and I think it’s the best one I’ve done so far. If you haven’t checked out my review of (((echo chamber))), you’re fuckin’ up. Shoutout to Mello Music Group for putting it out. Hello, good sir. Would you be interested in doing an interview for Focus Hip Hop? “Excitement.” How many languages have you tried to learn? Only a few. Wish I knew them all. The most helpful thing I learned in the hospital was body language. How did you get a citation in the Oxford English Dictionary. I was recognized for an accomplishment; pretty straightforward. How do you speak body language? Emotions. “Acting.” When did you overcome nerves? Does anyone ever? It appears that way to many? We’re asking too many deep questions. Which acting gestures did you have to be taught or relearn? Believe the message. “I know everything.”\nOkay, so these things apply to ALL gestures slash communicaziones. Let’s do a collaborative illustration for this interview. Good idea. I’ll draw my words. What are the most boring compliments you receive? I can’t complain about compliments, but I will say this. My old friend Brian Gibson once said, “People will like you for the wrong reasons. That’s something you’ll have to deal with.” No idea what he meant at the time, but mind blowing soon after. Understandable. Who’s your favorite writer? What kind of work does he write? Novels, poetry, and anthologies. Who’s your favorite writer? He writes at top levels in so many formats. It’s incredible. He’s who I aspire to be. Okay, I want to add George Carlin to my list. Prophetic. And Lao Tzu. Important names are being said. None more important than you, DJ Phocus. I appreciate that. Confidence is lacking by most people my age. Why and how do you know that’s true? I’m mentally ill.\nYou’re not alone in that, but are you generalizing that your generation is too? Funny. You’re smart. What did you think of (((Age War)))? Didn’t experience one. What is it? It’s on my album! For what it’s worth, I felt that way as a kid before you were born, so there goes the generation gap. “Thanksgiving.” Do you philosophize? You mean philosophize about thanksgiving? In general, what are the hardest questions to which you search for answers? 1. Can we instill values without religion? 2. How do we get rid of money? 3. Can I be a great dad & a great artist at the same time? 4. How do we prepare for climate collapse? 5. How do I bring people closer to oneness? 6. You got any answers for those? 7. Should I follow up Re-Thankskilling? 1. Doubted by most. 2. Be manipulative. 3. Yes. 4. Study Earth. 5. Role models. 6. Everyone has an “answer.” 7. Depends on inspiration. Just try your best. Any trauma in your life? Elaborate. Never mind, that’s kind of a rude command. Define “horror.” Personally…\nJeez, that sounds terrible for everyone involved. I stumbled on an article last night about greater mental health problems generally in younger generations. Hard to believe it’s not all pervasive, but I guess I really don’t know. Anyway, I have to wrap up this interview, DJ Phocus. Thanks for reaching out!!! Of course. Thank you for your participation. Yo. I would like to apologize for being resistant to the idea that mental illness is only getting worse. I actually know it is, but wanted to pretend otherwise so I could be less scared for my kids. Don’t worry, man.

Mike McGuire, both an artist and student of the genre, talked hip-hop last week at Mount Allison. McGuire is a recent graduate of Mount Saint Vincent University, whose time there culminated in a thesis on the history of hip-hop in Halifax; his talk outlined the genre’s rise and fall from its beginnings in the Bronx through its Golden Age in the nineties and ended with discussion of the genre’s current state. McGuire’s talk began with a discussion of the influences of hip-hop, in which he specifically mentioned the talking blues and West African music. Due mention was also given to the influence of poetry on the genre, and with nods to Gil Scott Heron and the Last Poets, McGuire detailed how these influences mixed in the Bronx. To set the scene, he talked about Robert Moses’ push for urban renewal by the city of New York in 1972, which saw massive construction projects in the Bronx. The Cross Bronx Expressway displaced millions in an effort to make the city more accessible to the suburbs. The result: property values plummeted, half a million jobs were lost, and youth unemployment spiked to eighty per cent. Four blocks a week were lost to fire throughout the decade because it was more profitable for landlords to lose their property and collect insurance than to maintain it. It was a place where people had to make their own fun, giving rise to many hip-hop related activities. Together these allowed the community to come together around music by converging in parks, stealing power, and putting on massive shows. After adding the caveat that this was only a history, and not the history, of hip-hop, he outlined the first advancements of hip-hop in the field of DJing. From DJ Kool Herc’s stringing the break beats of songs together to Grandmaster Flash’s clocking technique, the sound developed over the course of twenty years. McGuire discussed how, unlike preceding genres that became cultural touchstones, such as rock-‘n’-roll or jazz, hip-hop stayed largely true to itself and remained politically charged. As Chuck D famously said, “Rap is black America’s TV station. It gives a whole perspective about what exists and what black life is.”\nHowever, as rap became part of the mainstream its principle began to shift, the genre becoming more and more dominated by the themes and sounds of West Coast gangster rap. McGuire ended his talk on that note, opening up the floor for discussion. In these discussions, more controversial topics such as the direction and focus of contemporary hip-hop were brought up, including its focus on money and its attitudes toward women. McGuire is a rapper and producer himself, releasing albums and contributions to other projects under the moniker Hermitofthewoods. He is also an avid slam poet who has competed on the national stage, and a resident judge for The Elements League, which is part of a rap battle circuit. The talk was a planned part of the university’s celebration of Black History Month, some of which is now occurring during the month of March due to complications arising as a result of the strike.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:009a300f-7d84-48a8-8d3f-275b906526f7>"]},{"passage":"HHD: You have always loved music.

Your background, age, experiences, or education may give you a head start in some styles, but don't let that stop you from becoming adept at lyric genres with which you have had limited experience. Just as an actor can learn an accent or develop a character for a movie part, you can learn a new lyrical style and expand the kinds of songs you are capable of writing.Pop Lyrics\nModern pop lyrics are usually either trendy or timeless. Last year's slang will do you as much good as a pair of parachute pants. If you don't know what parachute pants are, they were a form of clothing that was extremely popular for about a year (or fifteen minutes, depending on where you lived) and then, quite suddenly, no one would be caught dead in them. Is “pop” really a genre? Pop is short for “popular.” What's popular changes from time to time. Pop lyrics and music tend to be highly accessible versions of whatever the popular genres are at a given time. A rock, hip-hop, or country song can be a pop song, if enough people get it. Trendy lyrics aim at the teen market (which buys the most CDs and has the newest, coolest slang terms). Examples of trendy lyrics include the Avril Lavigne song “Sk8er Boi” or, for its time, The Beach Boys classic “I Get Around.”\nLyrics in the timeless style must not only transcend barriers of time, but also economic status, ethnicity, and geography. Tough? Yes! Worth it? You bet! A timeless song can keep royalty checks coming for the rest of your life and beyond. A list of timeless lyrics might include “Unforgettable,” “Evergreen,” “Crazy,” and “Freebird.” Simple elegance and natural flow define the timeless lyric. Pop lyrics can be about most subjects, but love and relationships are the all-time big sellers. A pop lyric should be accessible to a large market so, aside from the newest “teenspeak,” try to avoid language that's regionally or demographically specific.Rock and Alt\nA good rock lyric is emotionally charged, dynamic, and forceful. Rock is about energy, so think powerful, think active, think passionate, and rock on! General rock topics include feeling boxed in, rebellion, wanting to have fun, passion, comeuppance, and angst or depression. Most rock lyrics have a tight, rhythmic meter and are easy to follow. This doesn't mean writing for third graders, it means getting to the point. Alt songs may be deeper, moodier, or more meditative and cover a broader range of subjects in addition to the general rock topics. In rock or alt, an uptempo danceable song or a love ballad that isn't too wimpy will usually be where the money is. Be careful with lyrics that deal with rebellion, angst, or depression. You wouldn't want your song to be unfairly blamed for a riot or a suicide. When dealing with these subjects and emotions, use an approach that let's the listener know he or she is not alone in feeling a certain way. Country songwriting has expanded to include other musical forms. It's the level of lyric writing and storytelling that sets country apart. Many great country songs have been based on stories the songwriter heard as a child from family or friends. Established country songwriters also recommend reading short stories and watching movies, sitcoms, talk shows, or news stories to get story ideas. Modern country lyrics cover many topics, so there's no need to start writing stories about cows and whiskey and cheating spouses; Nashville has more than enough of those already. Hallmarks of a modern country lyric are a conversational tone, a sense of humor, and reinforcement of basic values like hard work, faith, and honesty.Jazz and Rap\nWhile numerous and wonderful exceptions occur, jazz is usually more about the melody and the sound of the words than the actual lyric. Not that you can't have a great lyric in a jazz song, but make the melody and meter top priority. Pay careful attention to vowel sounds in a jazz lyric. Jazz treats the voice like an instrument and vowels influence the tone of the voice. Because of its droning, nonstandard melodic forms, rap requires very close attention to meter and rhyme.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:3dbcca13-acdf-4b1c-a8cd-b30ce0c620d4>"]},{"passage":"Well, we can't forget the past of jazz because it will take you to the future in music, but innovation and evolution is essential and we must give the right message to the up coming generations.What is in the near future?

Fired at over 1200°C, it is classed as stoneware and safe to use in dishwashers, microwaves and fridges. This makes Polish pottery suitable for everyday use at home and in catering. All dishes with a grooved bottom are also safe to use in traditional gas or electric ovens up to 280°C, as well as on glass, ceramic and electric hobs.\n\nThis Polish pottery Bowl\nis made by Ceramika Artystyczna\nworkshop in Boleslawiec, Poland. Manufacturer item number H2930I. It is 2¾\" high and measures 6½\" by 6½\". The capacity of this Bowl is 24 oz when filled to rim and it weighs 1.2 lbs. The pattern was designed by artist Starzyk\n. It is part of the Blue Daisy Bouquet Collection\nThis is a Polish pottery Unikat (Signature) Bowl, which means that it has been hand painted with both sponges and brushes and it is signed by the artist who painted it. Unikat pieces are the most intricate works of art. Larger Unikat items take hours of very careful work to finish.

My love for Polish pottery began with my own collection, which grew until I replaced most of my tableware with it. After receiving many compliments and buying a lot of pieces as gifts for friends and family, I decided to spread my love for Polish pottery and Groshek Pottery was born. Groshek (or groszek) means \"polka dot\" in Polish, which reflects the many beautiful spotty designs that Polish pottery is renowned for. What is Polish pottery? Every piece of Polish pottery is handmade and hand-decorated using stamps and brushes. It comes in hundreds of shapes, with patterns ranging from classic dots and “peacock eyes” to more intricate “artistic” or “UNIKAT” patterns.

(Getting Ready to Take Some Ground) Introduction: This is week four in our series “Eight Essential Exercises for Building a Better Body.” We’ve seen our need to find our strength in the Lord. Without His strength, we can’t even complete the rest of the exercises and our relationships will suffer. We’ve seen our need to make certain that our relationships are supported by and grounded in integrity. Without that belt of truth strapped around us, we cannot stand and our relationships crumble. Last week we considered the need to access the righteousness of Christ. We need to be right with God before we can be right in our relationships with others, and the way we get right with God is we allow the righteousness of Christ to be given to us. And then we ask him to fill us, to dwell in us and actually change our character so that we are truly a righteous people. This week we need to consider our need to be actively preparing to advance. The motto of the Boy Scouts is “always be prepared.” That’s a great motto, and Paul understood the need to be prepared. When he told us to have on, or put on the shoes of readiness that result from the Gospel he we was telling us to be prepared. A man without shoes is not prepared for much. In order to be prepared for action, a soldier on the front lines will sleep with his boots on at times. Having shoes on your feet is a symbol of readiness. It means you are prepared for action. You are prepared to go somewhere. When Merita and I take the kids and leave the house, the last thing we do is get shoes on all the kids. Once all of the shoes are on, then we are ready to go. You don’t leave the house to go someplace without shoes. Having your shoes on means that you’re ready. Paul knew that the soldier in his day wore shoes that kept him prepared for action. Often when we think of the shoes worn in the Mediterranean world of the first century we think of sandals. But the sandals worn by the Roman soldier were different than the sandals worn by the every day citizen. The sandals of the Roman soldier were designed for war, not for peace. When on duty he kept his sandals on so that he would be ready for action. To be prepared for combat you need quite a different shoe than you do for going to the corner store. These were specialized sandals. They had a thick sole to protect the soldiers feet from the hot sand and from sharp rocks. They also had nails driven through the soles, giving the sandals the ability to hold firm on sandy or slippery ground. Good footing was essential in winning a war and these shoes gave the soldier the good footing he needed. He wouldn’t slip or loose ground because the spikes would bite into the earth and help him hold firm. These shoes also helped the soldier to advance. A retreating army is rarely a winning army, but an army that can advance and take ground is an army that wins wars. The shoes of the soldier are designed for taking ground, advancing, and holding that ground, standing firm.","question_category":"first turn question; Natural","question_category_desc":"the initial question of a conversation, and therefore self-contained and understandable, without any other context.; phrased in the way people typically speak, reflecting everyday language use, without formal or artificial structure.","user_category":"Expert","user_category_desc":"A specialized user with deep understanding of the corpus.","question":"What was the strategic importance of the spiked soles in Roman military footwear?","gold":"The spiked soles in Roman military footwear were strategically important because they helped soldiers maintain firm footing during battle, which was essential for winning wars.

The caligae were designed to improve the stability and maneuverability of Roman soldiers during battles, particularly in wet or uneven terrain. The spikes would dig into the ground, providing a firm grip and preventing the soldiers from slipping, which could be crucial in combat situations.\n\nMoreover, the caligae allowed Roman soldiers to move more swiftly and effectively, which was essential for maintaining the pace of the legion during marches and battles. The design also offered a certain psychological advantage, as the distinctive noise of the spikes on the ground could intimidate enemies and serve as a symbol of Roman military might and discipline.\n\nIn summary, the spiked soles of the caligae were strategically important for enhancing the mobility, stability, and morale of Roman soldiers, thereby contributing to the effectiveness and success of the Roman army on the battlefield.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context:\nHistory of the Origin of Shoes in the World – Footwear might not be international to us.

Part of life was learning to live and succeed by using our own body mechanics for the best result in adapting to our environment, available materials, etc. This video is particularly fascinating as it illustrates how medieval people walked, ran and fought prior to the invention of hard soled shoes with built in heels. On impulse, I took the time to explore some of the comments and found them quite illuminating, educational or funny. And he isn’t using only the fencing manual illos as evidence, he just happened to toss that one up as an example. You see this ball-first gait and posture in illuminations, illustrations, and tapestries all over the damn place in medieval through early Renaissance artwork depicting all sorts of activities. It’s why so many figures in these look kind of dainty compared to what we might expect. Xaos Bob\nI think you’re missing an important distinction here; walking gaits vs running\/athletic gaits. Wear patterns on historical shoes (see the MoL – Shoes and Pattens chapter dedicated to this) and observation of primitive people of today suggest a normal heel to toe walking gait, just as we perform today in modern soled and heeled shoes. However, when running you do have to forefoot strike in historical shoes just as you do in modern barefoot style running shoes if you value the health of your joints. Historical people walked just like we do, but they likely ran differently than most modern people do. You can observe proper mechanics in young children. They instinctively walk heel-to-toe, but they run with a mid to forefoot strike. It’s not until years of sitting in a chair (adaptive shortening of the heel-cords, and reduced glute function etc.) and walking with modern footwear that they ‘re-train’ to heel-strike while running. Knyght Errant\nThis was quite interesting and it hit close to home. My father was an avid runner for most of his life. At different times I took up jogging to help lose weight but I struggled with it….as my time and distance was difficult to improve. I told this to my father who in turn told me a story. My father said he had read a book by a man (I don’t remember his name) who was from Europe and was a long distance runner. Long story short, he said that we should run as ancient people ran. These people ran on the balls of their feet. They never let there heels hit the ground first, even when they walked! Heel walking is not how our is designed to function. He also said conventional running shoes with the thick soles under the heel is a horrible shoe and we should run in shoes with little to no heel at all. I started ball running after that…and took about 3 days to get used to it and I bought track shoes that had no heel at all. By the end of the week I was easily running twice the distance at a faster pace. It felt like every time I had put my heel down first, I was “breaking” my forward momentum.

Fighting, stalking, and other activities certainly start with a ball or toe strike, but not for normal walking. deadextra\n\nLe Bohec calls for more detailed studies on the ranks of the army (Chapter 6, pp. 95-117). At the higher levels of responsibilty one can trace the military careers (p. 102 for a summary chart). St. Jerome’s use of military terminology assists in the reconstruction of lesser ranks (tables on pp. 103, 105) and Le Bohec finds continuities with terminology from Republican times. Military service itself was characterized by the increased performance of policing activities. Military building activity (Chapter 7, pp. 118-130) is a field in motion for Le Bohec, one marked by new excavations and new assessments of the already known data (site list on pp. 129-130). He cautions that one must abandon ideas of a ‘tetrarchische’ camp plan and notes that individual fortifications themselves seem to decrease in square area (Abb. 48 and p. 125). The next two chapters (Chapter 8, pp. 131-151; Chapter 9, pp. 152-170) discuss various aspects of the army’s tactics. Le Bohec removes the erroneous perception of the ‘soldier-farmer’ constantly tending crops (pp. 141 ff); supplies were made available by the state and private contractors with only limited interruptions in success (p. 146). Soldiers relied increasingly on artillery (missilia, tela), in addition to their swords and lances, although it proves difficult to match found objects with the terminology in literary sources (p. 134). Military diplomacy requires a more detailed study, but an increased interest on the part of the emperor in receiving all information-gathering reports is noted. As regards actual battle, the literary sources reflect that for most Romans military matters were an unknown quantity. No detailed portrait of a specific enemy normally was presented by ancient authors and Le Bohec argues against the selective rehabilitation of individual peoples, a practice known only this century and the end of the last (pp. 157-158). Overall, the army displayed a flexibility in battle tactics, which were adapted to deal with the enemy at hand and placed importance upon Pioneerarbeit. Chapters 10 (pp. 171-184), 11 (pp. 185-22), and 12 (pp. 201-212) discuss the various aspects of strategy. Le Bohec begins by dispelling misconceptions (pp. 171-173). By investigating the ancients’ use of strategic terminology (pp. 174-177) one discovers many continuities with earlier Roman practices, particularly those of the early empire. Le Bohec sets aside the view of a ‘bewegliche Armee”. Often it is difficult to distinguish between pure fortifications, cities in which soldiers were stationed, and cities proper (p. 181). The viae militares were not military in nature. Rather the term denotes a road of greater breadth (pp.183-184). The different theaters of action are surveyed in Chapters 11 and 12, with cautious reporting about the state of our knowledge and recent scholarship. Contact between military and civilians is the topic for Chapter 13 (pp. 218-228), the soldier’s life seen as ‘ein verzerrtes Bild der Zivilgesellschaft”, a somewhat altered model drawn from the structure of civil society (p. 213). Without soldiers the Empire would have proved ungovernable, hence the importance placed on the Emperor’s verbal communications and appearances before the troops, the adlocutio, and the more ornate adventus. Some gatherings are illustrated, but pose difficulties in interpretation (p. 215 and Abb. 16). Setting aside the illusory ‘soldier-farmer’, Le Bohec discusses the various forms of payment to the military and their economic impact (p. 223 for flow chart). The Roman army, like society, gradually Christianized, the first Christians present in the force as early as 200 AD. Chapters 14 (pp. 229-242) and 15 (pp. 243-260) return to a chronological narrative. The years 364-378 represent a worsening of the military situation, but Le Bohec cautions that the Voelkerwanderung was a slower process than often perceived.\n\nThe Brooklyn Museum’s “Killer Heels: The Art of the High-Heeled Shoe” exhibition explores the origins of high heels worn by women and men across the world since ancient times. Meanwhile, a book that was recently published under the title “Killer Heels” follows the story of high-heeled shoes through various essays and illustrations throughout history, from ancient Greece until modern times. In ancient Greece, platform sandals called “kothorni” were shoes with high wooden cork soles, worn by actors in order to differentiate the social classes and importance of each character during the play. Later, in ancient Rome, high heels were used to identify prostitutes to potential clients, therefore, high heels became associated with prostitution. In the Middle East around 1300 BC, people would wear high heels made from wood in the bath so that they would not slip on the wet floor. These wooden platform shoes were called Kabkabs, due to the sound they made when they hit the floor. During the Middle Ages, both men and women wore “pattens,” wooden soles attached to their shoes in order to keep their fragile and expensive footwear away from street mud. “Chopines,” another form of platform shoes, became popular in Turkey and throughout Europe around the 1400s until the mid-1600s. The shoes were often higher than 30 inches and women who wore them usually used canes or servants to assist them in walking.\n\nResearch paper topics, free example research papers\nFree research papers and essays on topics related to: military tactics\n- 18 results found, view research papers on page:\n- A Minute To Approximately Three And Hurt His Ability To Defend Himself While He Loaded The Awkward Device The Shortcomings As - 1,224 words\na minute to approximately three and hurt his ability to defend himself while he loaded the awkward device.

The time at which it was employed in the latter sense, cannot be fixed with certainty. The death of Caesar was ever before his eyes. Before they yielded to the Roman arms, they often disputed the field, and often renewed the contest. The Slow Death of the Roman Superpower Such refinements, under the odious name of luxury, have been severely arraigned by the moralists of every age; and it might perhaps be more conducive to the virtue, as well as happiness, of mankind, if all possessed the necessaries, and none the superfluities, of life. The Romans solved this problem in the short term by conquering their neighbours to appropriate their energy surpluses metals, grain, slaves, etc. He wished to deceive the people by an image of civil liberty, and the armies by an image of civil government. The dictator, or consul, had a right to command the service of the Roman youth; and to punish an obstinate or cowardly disobedience by the most severe and ignominious penalties, by striking the offender out of the list of citizens, by confiscating his property, and by selling his person into slavery. Tariffs were low and laws controlling the prices of foodstuffs and other commodities had little impact because they did not fix the prices significantly below their market levels.

This is not an example of the work written by our professional essay writers. Why did the roman army become so important in the last century BC? “Roman success in empire building was founded on the phenomenal achievements of their army.”\nThe relationship between the military and the chief political machinations of the state has been an ever present feature of history, from the first recorded geo-political actions of the Greek state up to the modern era, meted out in modern times in the democratic fight against authoritarianism and totalitarianism. In his Histories of the Peloponnesian Wars, Thucydides, writing from the viewpoint of an Athenian naval commander, notes the organic relationship between the fortunes of the armed forces and the decision making capabilities of the political apparatus. Further on, during the early sixteenth century – at the very cusp of the advent of the modern era – Machiavelli declared that the power of any given state was in relation to the perceived power of its armed forces. Essentially, these thinkers, from ancient history to Dr. Kissinger in the present day, all concur that the threat of the use of force by a supreme military power alters forever the balance of the status quo in favour of the strongest power. It is within the context of this realist doctrine of international relations theory that the historian locates the Roman political model in the first century BC – a society in a state of flux, caught in the ambitions of the early Republican founders yet confronted by the realism of the might of the growing Roman Army. To best answer the question a linear view of Roman history must be taken, analysing chronologically the changes that beset the republican model from the dawn of the century until the Restoration as overseen by Octavian. It will be seen how the fragile roots of Roman democracy facilitated the arrival of a militarily strong style of leadership; how the republican was eventually unable to fend off the right wing advances of a group of men with military ambition matched only by their desire for political power in the Senate. After the debacle of the Roman experiment with monarchy, the ruling, educated classes implemented a political republic with power diverted to the People. This necessitated a split within the people to characterise them as either ‘active’ or ‘passive’ citizens; those active citizens with enough power and influence gradually ascended the hierarchical ladder of the Roman Republic to wield influence in a variety of ways. Yet, in contrast to the republican paradigms of the modern era, the Romans never truly disassociated themselves from the ancient Greek ethos of conquest with the inherently heroic element to history that the Homeric tradition left as its enduring legacy. The main links that the historian has to the first century BC, namely Tacitus and Suetonius, were primarily concerned with recreating the glory of ancient warriors. It is a significant point because if the arts and literature of the contemporary period were concerned with romantic ideals of conquest and valour then it comes as little surprise to learn that the prevailing attitude amongst the political elite of Rome in the first century was similarly geared towards imperial examples of force. Therefore, with the stability of Rome temporarily secured, and the threat of a return of monarchical power made obsolete, the right wing nature of ancient societies made sure that expansion abroad was high on the political agenda. “It has already become clear that in various ways Rome’s small town Republican constitution was - for all the famous ‘balance’ between the classes, stressed by the Greek historian Polybius – unfitted for imperial responsibilities. The solution which imposed itself was the autocracy of the dictators Sulla (81-79BC) and Julius Caesar (48-44BC).”\nOf these two men the key figure as to why the marriage of convenience between the military and politics took place during the first century BC is without a doubt Caesar. He was the first man to make his name and fortune within the republican and then to transfer that influence to the field of military campaigns, primarily in Western Europe. There can be no denying the fact that he was motivated by a desire to attain personal valour and, as has been highlighted in the writings of Tacitus, to recreate the glories of quasi mythical figures such as Achilles and Alexander the Great.\n\nRetrieved June 22, 2020, from https:\/\/collections.museumoflondon.org.uk\/online\/object\/32681.html\nVolken, M.

The first day was simply for mustering, the second for marching and a skirmish, and the third for the final march and the battle at the Horns of Hattin. The first challenge I had to address was appropriate footwear for a hike over rugged terrain while carrying a load. I have been making my own footwear for reenactment purposes for several years. I decided it would be interesting to try to gauge the level of wear this sort of trek puts on them by beginning with a brand new pair. I didn’t know exactly what the terrain was going to be like before leaving, but the organizers emphasized the necessity for pattens. Pattens are a sort of sandal made of wood or stacked leather which are worn over the shoe. They add significant rigidity to the bottom of the shoes and are much easier to repair than the shoe. The problem with pattens for my specific context is that evidence of their use in the 12th century that I have been able to find is limited to a single toe strap found in London. The number of finds increases through the thirteenth century, and the largest groupings of pattens is assigned to the second half of the 14th century. (Grew p91-93) This increase in finds coincides with the development of road infrastructure, and pattens begin to decline as multi-soled shoes become popular. (Goubitz p253)\nThe justification from the event organizers for the use of pattens by the field armies of the 12th century was the existence of iron calks excavated at local sites These were essentially small iron cleats which would be affixed to the bottom of footwear at the heel, preventing excessive wear while minimally impacting traction. These were said to be in an unpublished archaeological report. The type of pattens recommended by the event coordinators was made of stacked leather, essentially multiple soles which were stitched together at the edges with a toe and heel strap. Being new to the event, I complied with their recommendations, and made the pattens pictured below. Since the 2017 event, Regnum Hierosolymitanum has changed their position on the use of stacked leather pattens being used in a late 12th century Outremer context. The earliest extant pattens in this style I have been able to find date to the 14th century. (Grew p100)\nDuring the hike, I ran into a number of problems with my pattens. On the second day, I found them to be excessively loose, collecting dirt, rocks, and sand between the sole of my shoe and the patten. I determined both the toe strap and the ankle strap needed to be tightened. During a skirmish with the Ayyubid forces, one of the pattens came off my toe and dangled behind my foot by the ankle strap, exasperating the problem. I made an impromptu repair, lashing the patten to my foot with a braided piece of palm fiber, but when we stopped for the evening I had a chance to properly repair them. There were two changes I needed to make. First, I decided to make the toe strap adjustable. I cut the toe straps in half and pierced a series of holes in the leather, through which I passed braided palm fibers and secured with knots. The more severe issue was the fit of the ankle strap. The problem was that the part of the strap passing around the back of my heel was too high.\n\n|Niccolò Mauruzi da Tolentino unseats Bernardino della Ciarda at the Battle of San Romano|\nPart 2 The Spur\nEven if our ancestors seemed to be concerned less with safety features than we are, the notion of riding a horse everyday with a total disregard for sensible riding is illogical. It is a mode of transportation with inherent risks, not a roulette wheel of conveyance. An overlooked use of a heel is that it provides a place to mount spurs. Riders attempt to move their mounts with leg pressure against the flank. Some mounts respond to this and others do not. Spurs provide an extra level of persuasion. Without going into the barbarity of the practice, a good rider uses spurs only to get the horse’s attention, not to drive steel into the side of another creature. That being said medieval spurs are long pointed prongs and I would not want to be the horse under a knight. So why did men begin to wear stacked heels in the in the 16th century? The connection to 8th through 14th century riders seems a bit spurious, no pun intended. However, a result of the transition from medieval hand weapon warfare to modern gun warfare might have included the evolution of riding tack--the stirrup, the spur and the boot. The spur has been in use in European riding for at least two millennia. Images of mounted horseman from the medieval period show heel-less or nearly heel-less riders using long stirrup straps. Two examples from the late 14th century provide a glimpse of spurs and foot placement for riders without heels. The Livre de Chasse commissioned by Gaston Fébus, Count of Foix and dedicated to Phillip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Fébus was a renowned hunter so the depiction of riding positions and the accouterments of hunters would have been of vital importance to a sportsman of his stature. The rider’s boots appear to have no heels, but do wear spurs. The other image illustrates a hunter with the standard riding position of the ball of the foot in the stirrup, but then he appears to be pacing, not pursuing. In one of the images the huntsman in pursuit of the stag is riding with at least one foot in a ‘jamming it home” stance without the aid of heels. These 14th century French noblemen for whom riding was a natural part of their existence, appear to be able to ride seriously without high-heels, but with the aid of stirrups. Although this is not an exhaustive study, these examples and other illustrations show medieval horseman riding with heel-less extended legs. The length of the leg and the geometry of the human body determine the distance covered by this arc. Due to the nature of the arc, a long strap stirrup may require a long sharp spur in order to compensate for an extended leg holding a stirrup in place rather than the effort going into the use of the spur itself. From the extant images the size of the heel, if it existed, seems to be inconsequential to the medieval rider. Part of this extension\nmay lie in the construction of medieval saddles, which brace the rider from the\nfront and back, thus giving the rider a very secure seat with the stirrups\nproviding a secondary means of balance. This longer stirrup configuration may\npartly explain the use of the long pointed spurs favored by medieval riders. With a leg in full suspension the spur needs to be longer in order to achieve\ncontact with a horse’s flank. Think of the stirrup as a weight and leg as a\npendulum shaft, any movement is limited and dependent upon contact between the\ntwo objects, leg and stirrup. The rider’s leg and foot apply pressure that\nmoves the stirrup in an arc. |Chasse, Hunting Gait|\nThe next installment will examine the heel.","passages":[{"passage":"History of the Origin of Shoes in the World – Footwear might not be international to us.

Part of life was learning to live and succeed by using our own body mechanics for the best result in adapting to our environment, available materials, etc. This video is particularly fascinating as it illustrates how medieval people walked, ran and fought prior to the invention of hard soled shoes with built in heels. On impulse, I took the time to explore some of the comments and found them quite illuminating, educational or funny. And he isn’t using only the fencing manual illos as evidence, he just happened to toss that one up as an example. You see this ball-first gait and posture in illuminations, illustrations, and tapestries all over the damn place in medieval through early Renaissance artwork depicting all sorts of activities. It’s why so many figures in these look kind of dainty compared to what we might expect. Xaos Bob\nI think you’re missing an important distinction here; walking gaits vs running\/athletic gaits. Wear patterns on historical shoes (see the MoL – Shoes and Pattens chapter dedicated to this) and observation of primitive people of today suggest a normal heel to toe walking gait, just as we perform today in modern soled and heeled shoes. However, when running you do have to forefoot strike in historical shoes just as you do in modern barefoot style running shoes if you value the health of your joints. Historical people walked just like we do, but they likely ran differently than most modern people do. You can observe proper mechanics in young children. They instinctively walk heel-to-toe, but they run with a mid to forefoot strike. It’s not until years of sitting in a chair (adaptive shortening of the heel-cords, and reduced glute function etc.) and walking with modern footwear that they ‘re-train’ to heel-strike while running.

My father said he had read a book by a man (I don’t remember his name) who was from Europe and was a long distance runner. Long story short, he said that we should run as ancient people ran. These people ran on the balls of their feet. They never let there heels hit the ground first, even when they walked! Heel walking is not how our is designed to function. He also said conventional running shoes with the thick soles under the heel is a horrible shoe and we should run in shoes with little to no heel at all. I started ball running after that…and took about 3 days to get used to it and I bought track shoes that had no heel at all. By the end of the week I was easily running twice the distance at a faster pace. It felt like every time I had put my heel down first, I was “breaking” my forward momentum.

At the higher levels of responsibilty one can trace the military careers (p. 102 for a summary chart). St. Jerome’s use of military terminology assists in the reconstruction of lesser ranks (tables on pp. 103, 105) and Le Bohec finds continuities with terminology from Republican times. Military service itself was characterized by the increased performance of policing activities. Military building activity (Chapter 7, pp. 118-130) is a field in motion for Le Bohec, one marked by new excavations and new assessments of the already known data (site list on pp. 129-130). He cautions that one must abandon ideas of a ‘tetrarchische’ camp plan and notes that individual fortifications themselves seem to decrease in square area (Abb. 48 and p. 125). The next two chapters (Chapter 8, pp. 131-151; Chapter 9, pp. 152-170) discuss various aspects of the army’s tactics. Le Bohec removes the erroneous perception of the ‘soldier-farmer’ constantly tending crops (pp. 141 ff); supplies were made available by the state and private contractors with only limited interruptions in success (p. 146). Soldiers relied increasingly on artillery (missilia, tela), in addition to their swords and lances, although it proves difficult to match found objects with the terminology in literary sources (p. 134). Military diplomacy requires a more detailed study, but an increased interest on the part of the emperor in receiving all information-gathering reports is noted. As regards actual battle, the literary sources reflect that for most Romans military matters were an unknown quantity. No detailed portrait of a specific enemy normally was presented by ancient authors and Le Bohec argues against the selective rehabilitation of individual peoples, a practice known only this century and the end of the last (pp. 157-158). Overall, the army displayed a flexibility in battle tactics, which were adapted to deal with the enemy at hand and placed importance upon Pioneerarbeit. Chapters 10 (pp. 171-184), 11 (pp. 185-22), and 12 (pp. 201-212) discuss the various aspects of strategy. Le Bohec begins by dispelling misconceptions (pp. 171-173). By investigating the ancients’ use of strategic terminology (pp. 174-177) one discovers many continuities with earlier Roman practices, particularly those of the early empire. Le Bohec sets aside the view of a ‘bewegliche Armee”. Often it is difficult to distinguish between pure fortifications, cities in which soldiers were stationed, and cities proper (p. 181). The viae militares were not military in nature. Rather the term denotes a road of greater breadth (pp.183-184). The different theaters of action are surveyed in Chapters 11 and 12, with cautious reporting about the state of our knowledge and recent scholarship. Contact between military and civilians is the topic for Chapter 13 (pp. 218-228), the soldier’s life seen as ‘ein verzerrtes Bild der Zivilgesellschaft”, a somewhat altered model drawn from the structure of civil society (p. 213). Without soldiers the Empire would have proved ungovernable, hence the importance placed on the Emperor’s verbal communications and appearances before the troops, the adlocutio, and the more ornate adventus. Some gatherings are illustrated, but pose difficulties in interpretation (p. 215 and Abb. 16). Setting aside the illusory ‘soldier-farmer’, Le Bohec discusses the various forms of payment to the military and their economic impact (p. 223 for flow chart). The Roman army, like society, gradually Christianized, the first Christians present in the force as early as 200 AD.

Meanwhile, a book that was recently published under the title “Killer Heels” follows the story of high-heeled shoes through various essays and illustrations throughout history, from ancient Greece until modern times. In ancient Greece, platform sandals called “kothorni” were shoes with high wooden cork soles, worn by actors in order to differentiate the social classes and importance of each character during the play. Later, in ancient Rome, high heels were used to identify prostitutes to potential clients, therefore, high heels became associated with prostitution. In the Middle East around 1300 BC, people would wear high heels made from wood in the bath so that they would not slip on the wet floor. These wooden platform shoes were called Kabkabs, due to the sound they made when they hit the floor. During the Middle Ages, both men and women wore “pattens,” wooden soles attached to their shoes in order to keep their fragile and expensive footwear away from street mud. “Chopines,” another form of platform shoes, became popular in Turkey and throughout Europe around the 1400s until the mid-1600s.

This is not an example of the work written by our professional essay writers. Why did the roman army become so important in the last century BC? “Roman success in empire building was founded on the phenomenal achievements of their army.”\nThe relationship between the military and the chief political machinations of the state has been an ever present feature of history, from the first recorded geo-political actions of the Greek state up to the modern era, meted out in modern times in the democratic fight against authoritarianism and totalitarianism. In his Histories of the Peloponnesian Wars, Thucydides, writing from the viewpoint of an Athenian naval commander, notes the organic relationship between the fortunes of the armed forces and the decision making capabilities of the political apparatus. Further on, during the early sixteenth century – at the very cusp of the advent of the modern era – Machiavelli declared that the power of any given state was in relation to the perceived power of its armed forces. Essentially, these thinkers, from ancient history to Dr. Kissinger in the present day, all concur that the threat of the use of force by a supreme military power alters forever the balance of the status quo in favour of the strongest power. It is within the context of this realist doctrine of international relations theory that the historian locates the Roman political model in the first century BC – a society in a state of flux, caught in the ambitions of the early Republican founders yet confronted by the realism of the might of the growing Roman Army. To best answer the question a linear view of Roman history must be taken, analysing chronologically the changes that beset the republican model from the dawn of the century until the Restoration as overseen by Octavian. It will be seen how the fragile roots of Roman democracy facilitated the arrival of a militarily strong style of leadership; how the republican was eventually unable to fend off the right wing advances of a group of men with military ambition matched only by their desire for political power in the Senate. After the debacle of the Roman experiment with monarchy, the ruling, educated classes implemented a political republic with power diverted to the People. This necessitated a split within the people to characterise them as either ‘active’ or ‘passive’ citizens; those active citizens with enough power and influence gradually ascended the hierarchical ladder of the Roman Republic to wield influence in a variety of ways. Yet, in contrast to the republican paradigms of the modern era, the Romans never truly disassociated themselves from the ancient Greek ethos of conquest with the inherently heroic element to history that the Homeric tradition left as its enduring legacy. The main links that the historian has to the first century BC, namely Tacitus and Suetonius, were primarily concerned with recreating the glory of ancient warriors. It is a significant point because if the arts and literature of the contemporary period were concerned with romantic ideals of conquest and valour then it comes as little surprise to learn that the prevailing attitude amongst the political elite of Rome in the first century was similarly geared towards imperial examples of force. Therefore, with the stability of Rome temporarily secured, and the threat of a return of monarchical power made obsolete, the right wing nature of ancient societies made sure that expansion abroad was high on the political agenda. “It has already become clear that in various ways Rome’s small town Republican constitution was - for all the famous ‘balance’ between the classes, stressed by the Greek historian Polybius – unfitted for imperial responsibilities. The solution which imposed itself was the autocracy of the dictators Sulla (81-79BC) and Julius Caesar (48-44BC).”\nOf these two men the key figure as to why the marriage of convenience between the military and politics took place during the first century BC is without a doubt Caesar. He was the first man to make his name and fortune within the republican and then to transfer that influence to the field of military campaigns, primarily in Western Europe. There can be no denying the fact that he was motivated by a desire to attain personal valour and, as has been highlighted in the writings of Tacitus, to recreate the glories of quasi mythical figures such as Achilles and Alexander the Great.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:71962afa-6200-47c8-86d3-bd9a1bc6700b>"]},{"passage":"Retrieved June 22, 2020, from https:\/\/collections.museumoflondon.org.uk\/online\/object\/32681.html\nVolken, M. (2014). Archaeological Footwear. Assen: SPA Uitgevers. I have been making and using reproductions of medieval for several years. This involves a continual process of iteration, failure, and improvement. One event I participated in which included several learning opportunities was The Battle of Hattin reenactment in 2017, hosted by Regnum Hierosolymitanum in Israel. This event took place on the location where the Army of Jerusalem mustered, the road it marched upon, and the site of the battle on the closest weekend to the 830th anniversary of the battle. The event took place over three days in the height of the Israeli summer, 30June-02July. The daily high temperature was approximately 46°C (115°F) in the shade, and the distance covered was approximately 35km (22mi) over two the three days. The first day was simply for mustering, the second for marching and a skirmish, and the third for the final march and the battle at the Horns of Hattin. The first challenge I had to address was appropriate footwear for a hike over rugged terrain while carrying a load. I have been making my own footwear for reenactment purposes for several years. I decided it would be interesting to try to gauge the level of wear this sort of trek puts on them by beginning with a brand new pair. I didn’t know exactly what the terrain was going to be like before leaving, but the organizers emphasized the necessity for pattens. Pattens are a sort of sandal made of wood or stacked leather which are worn over the shoe. They add significant rigidity to the bottom of the shoes and are much easier to repair than the shoe. The problem with pattens for my specific context is that evidence of their use in the 12th century that I have been able to find is limited to a single toe strap found in London. The number of finds increases through the thirteenth century, and the largest groupings of pattens is assigned to the second half of the 14th century. (Grew p91-93) This increase in finds coincides with the development of road infrastructure, and pattens begin to decline as multi-soled shoes become popular. (Goubitz p253)\nThe justification from the event organizers for the use of pattens by the field armies of the 12th century was the existence of iron calks excavated at local sites These were essentially small iron cleats which would be affixed to the bottom of footwear at the heel, preventing excessive wear while minimally impacting traction. These were said to be in an unpublished archaeological report. The type of pattens recommended by the event coordinators was made of stacked leather, essentially multiple soles which were stitched together at the edges with a toe and heel strap. Being new to the event, I complied with their recommendations, and made the pattens pictured below. Since the 2017 event, Regnum Hierosolymitanum has changed their position on the use of stacked leather pattens being used in a late 12th century Outremer context. The earliest extant pattens in this style I have been able to find date to the 14th century. (Grew p100)\nDuring the hike, I ran into a number of problems with my pattens. On the second day, I found them to be excessively loose, collecting dirt, rocks, and sand between the sole of my shoe and the patten. I determined both the toe strap and the ankle strap needed to be tightened. During a skirmish with the Ayyubid forces, one of the pattens came off my toe and dangled behind my foot by the ankle strap, exasperating the problem. I made an impromptu repair, lashing the patten to my foot with a braided piece of palm fiber, but when we stopped for the evening I had a chance to properly repair them. There were two changes I needed to make. First, I decided to make the toe strap adjustable. I cut the toe straps in half and pierced a series of holes in the leather, through which I passed braided palm fibers and secured with knots. The more severe issue was the fit of the ankle strap. The problem was that the part of the strap passing around the back of my heel was too high.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:0892a90c-6a9e-4545-8695-d380d1c48776>"]},{"passage":"|Niccolò Mauruzi da Tolentino unseats Bernardino della Ciarda at the Battle of San Romano|\nPart 2 The Spur\nEven if our ancestors seemed to be concerned less with safety features than we are, the notion of riding a horse everyday with a total disregard for sensible riding is illogical. It is a mode of transportation with inherent risks, not a roulette wheel of conveyance. An overlooked use of a heel is that it provides a place to mount spurs. Riders attempt to move their mounts with leg pressure against the flank. Some mounts respond to this and others do not. Spurs provide an extra level of persuasion. Without going into the barbarity of the practice, a good rider uses spurs only to get the horse’s attention, not to drive steel into the side of another creature. That being said medieval spurs are long pointed prongs and I would not want to be the horse under a knight. So why did men begin to wear stacked heels in the in the 16th century? The connection to 8th through 14th century riders seems a bit spurious, no pun intended. However, a result of the transition from medieval hand weapon warfare to modern gun warfare might have included the evolution of riding tack--the stirrup, the spur and the boot. The spur has been in use in European riding for at least two millennia. Images of mounted horseman from the medieval period show heel-less or nearly heel-less riders using long stirrup straps. Two examples from the late 14th century provide a glimpse of spurs and foot placement for riders without heels. The Livre de Chasse commissioned by Gaston Fébus, Count of Foix and dedicated to Phillip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Fébus was a renowned hunter so the depiction of riding positions and the accouterments of hunters would have been of vital importance to a sportsman of his stature. The rider’s boots appear to have no heels, but do wear spurs. The other image illustrates a hunter with the standard riding position of the ball of the foot in the stirrup, but then he appears to be pacing, not pursuing. In one of the images the huntsman in pursuit of the stag is riding with at least one foot in a ‘jamming it home” stance without the aid of heels. These 14th century French noblemen for whom riding was a natural part of their existence, appear to be able to ride seriously without high-heels, but with the aid of stirrups. Although this is not an exhaustive study, these examples and other illustrations show medieval horseman riding with heel-less extended legs. The length of the leg and the geometry of the human body determine the distance covered by this arc. Due to the nature of the arc, a long strap stirrup may require a long sharp spur in order to compensate for an extended leg holding a stirrup in place rather than the effort going into the use of the spur itself. From the extant images the size of the heel, if it existed, seems to be inconsequential to the medieval rider. Part of this extension\nmay lie in the construction of medieval saddles, which brace the rider from the\nfront and back, thus giving the rider a very secure seat with the stirrups\nproviding a secondary means of balance. This longer stirrup configuration may\npartly explain the use of the long pointed spurs favored by medieval riders. With a leg in full suspension the spur needs to be longer in order to achieve\ncontact with a horse’s flank. Think of the stirrup as a weight and leg as a\npendulum shaft, any movement is limited and dependent upon contact between the\ntwo objects, leg and stirrup. The rider’s leg and foot apply pressure that\nmoves the stirrup in an arc. |Chasse, Hunting Gait|\nThe next installment will examine the heel.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ee153001-ebf2-4445-909f-53d25be1db42>"]}]}

Wine has a rich cherry color and rich aroma with hints of dried fruit, red plum, vanilla and cherry. It is perfectly suited to dishes of poultry, meats, hot dishes, red and white meat. Once upon a time in ancient Greece there was a peninsula of Lefkada, which was inhabited by Greek colonists. He was famous for its limestone soils on which the grapes cultivated magnificent, from which, in turn, created a good wine. Therefore motives myths of ancient Greece played a large role in creating the company \"Lefkadia.\" Its logo is decorated mascaron, which is divided into dark and light halves, showing how differently wine affects a person, reflecting a light or dark side of his soul. The bright side represents Dionysus, dark - Faun Silenus. Winery \"Lefkadia\" was founded in 2006 in the Krasnodar region, in the village of Moldavanskoye.

It is recommended to serve it with poultry, meats, hot dishes, and both red and white meat.","answer":"As an AI, I don't have real-time access to specific product details or tasting notes for all wines, including Likuriya red wine, as my knowledge is not up-to-date and I don't have the capability to taste or access current databases. However, I can give you a general guide on how to describe the taste profile of a red wine and suggest typical food pairings based on common characteristics.\n\nA red wine's taste profile can generally be described in terms of its body, acidity, tannins, sweetness, and flavor profile (fruit, oak, earth, and other). \n\n- **Body**: This refers to the weight and fullness of the wine. A light-bodied red might feel more delicate and watery, while a full-bodied red is rich and dense.\n  \n- **Acidity**: Wines with high acidity will have a crisp, fresh, and sometimes tart taste, which can make your mouth water.\n\n- **Tannins**: These are compounds that give red wines their drying and sometimes bitter taste. They are found in the skins, seeds, and stems of grapes and contribute to the wine's structure and aging potential.\n\n- **Sweetness**: Red wines can range from very dry to slightly sweet. The sweetness level is determined by the amount of residual sugar left in the wine after fermentation.\n\n- **Flavor Profile**: This includes the primary fruit flavors (like cherry, raspberry, plum, etc.), secondary flavors from oak aging (vanilla, toast, etc.), and tertiary flavors from aging (tobacco, leather, etc.).\n\nFor food pairing, a general rule is to match the weight and intensity of the wine with the food. A light-bodied red might pair well with delicate dishes like chicken or pasta with tomato sauce, while a full-bodied red like a Cabernet Sauvignon is often paired with rich meats like steak.\n\nHowever, these are just guidelines. Personal taste, regional traditions, and specific wine characteristics can all influence the best pairing. \n\nIf you're interested in the specific taste profile and food pairings for Likuriya red wine, I would recommend reaching out to the winery directly or consulting a sommelier or wine expert for the most accurate and up-to-date information. They would be able to provide tasting notes and pairing suggestions based on their experience with that particular wine.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context:\nAnd the majority of the time, when you’re serving wine, there will be some sort of food involved. So it’s important to know the basics of food & wine pairing. Right now, there’s only one principle that you need to be aware of when you’re matching wine with food: The lighter the food, the lighter the wine. The richer the food, the richer the wine. It’s as simple as that. For example, red meats, like beef and lamb, are considered to be rich and heavy foods. According to the principle, that means that they would match very well with a rich and heavy wine. Like a full-bodied red wine. On the other side of the spectrum, oysters are a very light and delicate food. So they wouldn’t match very well with a rich full-bodied red wine. But they would match extremely well with a lighter styled wine, like a sparkling wine or a light-bodied white wine. If you only applied this principal, most of the time, you would nail your food & wine pairings. But what about the food & wine that land in the middle of the spectrum? For example, what type of food would go well with a light-bodied red wine or a full-bodied white wine? Well, the answer isn’t a simple as ‘this food goes with that’ or ‘that wine goes with this’. Most foods go well with a few different styles of wine and vice-versa. And it takes a bit of experimentation and memorization to learn what types of food go well with what styles of wine. It also depends on what people like. In part 4, we’ll give you some specific details of what types of wine go with what types of food. For now, it’s sufficient enough to know that light foods, go with light wines. And rich foods, go with rich wines. We’ve just been through a lot there. So take your time with it. Once you have a solid understanding of how to taste wine, describe it, and pair wine with food, you’ll have developed all the tools you need to learn about wine and confidently talk about it with anyone. In part 3 of this guide, you’ll be learning how to put those tools to practical use as a bartender. You’ll learn how to recommend wine you know the customer will enjoy. And then you’ll learn how to serve it like a pro. Until then, remember my sommelier friend’s advice, ‘In order to learn about wine, you must drink wine!’ So go out there, buy a few bottles, and start doing your ‘research’.\n\nIn this case, look for a large pitcher and transfer the wine energetically, so that the liquid hits against the glass and increases the aeration effect. We call this aerating wine. FOOD AND WINE PAIRING. The harmony between wine and food or, as it is often called, pairing (from the French “marriage,” meaning marriage), is an exciting field where many factors come into play: the physiochemical reactions occurring and how we perceive them through our senses, one’s personal taste, cultural backgrounds, the association of ideas, etc. When thinking about the pairing, we must consider all the sensations which both wine and food produce in us: the flavors (sour, salty, sweet, bitter), tactile and chemical sensations (texture, spiciness), temperature (which greatly changes our perception), and aromas. In general, the majority of pairings are established by association or complementariness: color (whites with white meat, reds with red meat), flavors (sweet desserts with sweet wines), sensations (fatty foods with tannic wines), aromas (smoked foods with oaky whites), or intensity (strong foods with full-bodied wines). But sometimes, contrast pairing – like blue cheese with sweet wine – can yield excellent results. Obviously, there are also foods that are difficult to pair with wine, such as those based on very bitter foods (like artichokes) or very hot and spicy (spices). Don’t think that common pairings are definitive or that there are any hard and fast rules to it. Curiosity and the pursuit of pleasure should prevail. Allow your personal preferences to lead and remember that the combination possibilities are endless. Here are some ideas, depending on the type of wine:\n– Simple young white wines: a light appetizer. – Noble varieties (Chardonnay) of young white wines: white fish, goat cheese. – Oaky Chardonnay: fatty fish (sea bream, turbot), smoked fish or meats, white meat. – Rosé wines: vegetables, pasta, rice, cured meats, soft cheeses. – Young red wines: cured meats, pâtés, medium cheeses, bluefish and even some dishes made with salt cod. – Crianza red wines: grilled meats, roasts, stews, cured cheeses. – Reserva, Gran Reserva, and Vanguardista (“cutting edge”) wines: more subtle and elaborate game dishes and stews. – Sweet wines: fruit-based desserts for lighter wines, tarts with dried fruits for denser wines.\n\nBecause you won’t be able to describe a wine to customers if you don’t know what to describe in the first place! The 5 principle characteristics of wine are:\n- Flavour Profile (fruit, oak, earth, other)\nThe first element you need to be aware of is the ‘body’ of the wine. The ‘body’ is simply a way of categorizing different styles of wine from lightest to boldest. In general, knowing the body of a wine is as simple as knowing the grape variety. Because most of the time, grape varieties share the same ‘body’ regardless of how or where the wine was made. Red wines are categorized into light-bodied, medium-bodied, and full-bodied wines. Whereas white wines are categorized into light-bodied, full-bodied, and aromatic wines. The difference between these styles of wine will be obvious once you’ve tasted them side by side. But a great way to think about them is to compare the difference between skim and full cream milk. Full cream milk is much richer and fuller in flavor than skim milk. The same can be said for full-bodied wine in comparison to light-bodied wine. With medium-bodied wine landing somewhere in the middle. The aromatic white wines category simply means that the wine will have highly perfumed and sweet fruit aromas. Although that doesn’t necessarily mean that the wine itself will be sweet. The sweetness\/dryness of a wine is referring to how much residual sugar is left in the wine (i.e. how sweet the wine is). If there’s a lot, you’ll describe the wine as ‘very sweet’. If there’s hardly any, you’ll describe the wine as ‘very dry’. This is a characteristic you’ll need to describe with all white, sparkling, and rosé wines. But you won’t need to worry about describing the sweetness levels of red wines as they all have some element of sweetness. Customers will commonly ask you for dry white wines. Even though the majority of white wines are dry, it generally means that they’re looking for the driest wine possible. Acids are what gives a wine its sour\/tart flavor. When you taste citrus (lemon, lime, orange) in a wine, it’s because the wine has some element of acidity. You can also feel a wine’s level of acidity because it will make your mouth water. This is an important characteristic to describe with all styles of wine. All white wines have some element of citrus which makes tasting the acidity obvious. But red wines can have high levels of acids too. But because red wines have higher amounts of sugar, the sweetness balances out the acids so they’re not as obvious (think about balancing simple syrup with lemon\/lime juice in cocktails). The sauvignon blanc white wine is a great example of what a wine with high acidity tastes like. It tastes sour, there are strong elements of citrus, and it makes your mouth water. Tannins are unique to red wines. So you don’t need to worry about describing them when you’re dealing with white wines. Tannins are what cause the grippy\/drying feeling on your tongue and that’s how you’ll recognize them. A high tannin wine will almost make your tongue feel numb. This is an important characteristic to cover when you’re describing red wines. If you’re looking for an example of tannin, you only need to taste a young vintage Cabernet Sauvignon red wine and you’ll know exactly what I mean. This is when a glass of wine starts to get interesting. When I mentioned in part 1 that the astute wine drinker can pick up tobacco, mint, vanilla, citrus, cherry, and even sweaty socks in a glass of wine, this is what I was talking about. The flavor profile of a wine is essential every flavor\/scent that we can smell in the wine. There are a lot of different flavors in this world, even within wine. So to make understanding them easier, they can be broken down into 4 major categories: fruit, oak, earth, and the catchall ‘other.’\nWhen you taste & smell wine you should try and identify any flavors (or lack thereof) from each of these categories. Every wine has some element of fruit in it. Some of these fruits are out there and more exotic, whilst others are a lot more familiar and closer to home.\n\nWelcome to Wine by Alex, the show to watch to take your wine game to the next level! Today you’re watching the first episode of #Askwinebyalex of 2021. I’ve got a question from Alessio of @alevalente91:\n« Alex, can you remind me of the basics of food and wine pairing? »\nAlessio, that’s such a great question! I’ve done a few posts about this topic a while ago. And I was actually thinking to do a video to refresh the information. So you’re right on time! Few things to take into account for food & wine pairings\nEveryone’s perception and taste are different\nSome people are very sensitive, others don’t. The same level of sweetness or acidity can be perceived totally differently by two persons. On top of that, we all have our own personal taste. Some people like bitterness, others don’t. Every one of us is totally different. So you might enjoy your pairings, but it may not be the case of the people around you. Food is generally responsible of bad interaction, not wine\nFood and wine have a mutual influence on each other. The goal here is to have more pleasure having food and wine together, rather than separately. And also to avoid any unfortunate pairings. Now that everything is settled, let’s dive into the basics of food and wine pairing! You’ve got to understand there are 2 elements in food that will improve wine and 2 elements that will spoil it. The 2 wine-friendly elements in food: acidity and saltiness\nI’ll start with the 2 elements that will improve the wine you’re tasting: acidity and saltiness. They increase pleasant sensations in wine: sweetness, fruitiness and body. They also decrease the unpleasant sensations in wine, like astringency, bitterness and too strong acidity. Salty meals go with basically every wine and the great thing is that they’ll enhance wine aromas. So it’s all beneficial to you! Be careful to pair acid meals with wines that are even more acidic. Otherwise, they’ll just seem flat. - Think about Champagne, Muscadet, Sauvignon Blanc, Albarino, Riesling, Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo, Pinot Noir,…\nThe 2 elements unfavourable to wine: sweetness and umami\nNow let’s talk about the 2 elements in food that will be unfavourable to wine: sweetness and umami. Not only they increase unpleasant sensations in wine: astringency, bitterness, too strong acidity, alcohol burn. But they also decrease pleasant sensations like sweetness, fruitiness and body… So as you probably guessed by now, they’re quite hard to pair with wine. But, what’s umami? It’s a taste that combines saltiness and bitterness. You’ll find it a lot in Asian food like soy sauce or miso soup, but also in asparagus, eggs, mushrooms and oysters. You need to pair sweet meals with wines that are even sweeter. This way, you’ll increase their fruitiness and balance the acidity that might be increased by the food. Meals that contain umami need to be paired with very fruity wines and, if you want a red wine, choose one that has low tannins. This way you’ll increase the fruitiness and diminish the astringent sensation of tannins. - When you have meals with umami, think about Beaujolais, unoaked Pinot Noir, or Chardonnay from Mâcon. - When you have sweet meals, go all out with a Sauternes, Barsac, Tokaji Aszu or a PX. Other consideration you can take into account\nIt can be tricky to pair spicy food with wine because the spiciness increases alcohol burn and bitterness of a wine. - Think about wines with low tannins and low alcohol. Also try to choose very fruity wines with a bit of sweetness, like Pinot Gris. Similar aromatic intensity\nI said earlier that food and wine pairings are supposed to give you more pleasure than if you were having the food, or the wine, separately. This means you also have to consider the aromatic intensity when you make your pairings! You don’t want to have one element hidden by the other one.\n\nA simple approach to wine buying is to match the acidity of the wine with the acidity of the dish. That’s because you don’t want the acidity of the food to overpower the wine. Both white and red wines (depending on the darkness of the skins) can be acidic depending on how they were made (like being aged in an oak barrel versus a steel barrel). Some foods, like chicken and pork, can go with either white or red wine depending on how they’re prepared. Generally, I suggest a white wine for either, and maybe a rosé (often midway in its acidity – thus one of my favorite food wine pairs) or light red, depending on the overall flavor. As for red wines, the skins and seeds included in the pressing and fermentation release even more tannic acids and alcohols into the wines – creating the flavor and color. Remember that with red wines, the lighter the wine color, the lower the tannins. That’s what creates the spectrum, varying levels of tannins. Fatty foods like steak require heavy-tannin reds like cabernets and merlots. Meanwhile, light to moderate fatty foods like salmon or pork can pair well with a light red like a pinot or Chianti. Finally, there’s one more rule for simple pairing… Pair spice with sweet. Sweeter wines, especially whites like riesling, tend to pair better with spicier foods like Thai and Mexican. That’s because sweeter wines help coat your burning tongue (from the spiciness) with sugars. Keep in mind, lower alcohol wines, like riesling and moscato, are also gentler on your palate as you enjoy spicy foods. These are my basic rules for wine pairing:\n- Focus on your taste and what you imagine it tastes like. - Make a guess as to how many tannins are in the wine. Weigh that against how heavy and acidic your food is… lemon mango salsa grilled tuna needs a bright acidic white wine with texture and body. A heavy rib eye with gravy and potatoes needs a dark and perhaps oaked red wine. And in between, say turkey or ham deserves a heavier white wine, a crisp rosé or lighter red. - Pair spicy with sweet. To make it even easier, here’s a list I put together for the most common food and wine pairings…\n- Fish: White\n- Pork: Rosé or white\n- Chicken: White or light red\n- Beef: Red\n- Pasta: Light red, though richer pasta dishes need acidic and ageable red wines\nKeep in mind, these are general rules based on food chemistry. You may find varieties of wines that go better with your meal but appear to break these rules. An old classmate of mine from graduate school at Kellogg once wrote to tell me he’d just had my Eifrig Cabernet Sauvignon with grilled swordfish on the beach. I loved it… it’s easy to see how my reds could balance the meatier texture of swordfish. And the oil and richness of the fish was complemented by the perfectly balanced acids and heavier tannins of my cabernet. Remember… The best part of learning about wine is trying and discovering what you like! The most important thing is that the value of wine tasting lies with you, the individual taster. Spending hundreds of dollars on a “good” bottle of wine doesn’t mean you’ll enjoy it (unless it’s mine of course). The best way to experience new wines pre-coronavirus was to stop by a local wine store for free tastings – often done several times a month. In some places and states, they might still be doing this… just call the store or check its website to see when it offers an event. It’s a great way to sample wine for free and get closer to finding your ideal wine. Likewise, when I’m dining out, I always ask the wait staff what they’d recommend with my dish and then ask them to get me a sip of a couple ideas before I pick what I want.

What We’re Reading…\n- Something different: We owe Milli Vanilli an apology.\n\nToday I am speaking at the 4th annual American Wine Bloggers Conference in Charlottesville, Virginia on the topic of Wine & Food Pairing so I thought I’d let you in on some of the goods. As soon as I have a link to the video of the presentation I promise to post it here… even if I trip and make a fool of myself! Really, what I want to focus on is that there is some truth to the idea of food and wine pairings and it is not a bunch of BS or “poppycock” as some have alluded to. I am passionate about the topic of food and wine pairing and am on a mission to make the idea less intimidating to people! So here goes. Below is some very basic info on pairing food and wine touched upon in my presentation. Consider this the basic fundamentals in understanding food and wine. FOOD & WINE PAIRING\nAt its core food & wine pairing is about synergy, balance, harmony: The food should not overpower the wine, nor should the wine overpower the food. Key word: BALANCE\nElements in food and wine can complement or contrast each other. - Complimenting: taste of the food and the wine should be similar. The sauce shouldn’t be sweeter than the wine, or acid in the dish is sufficiently matched to the acid in the wine. - Contrasting flavors: sweet wine with a salty dish, or sweet wine with spicy dish. Think chocolate covered pretzels, or salted caramels. These flavors are contrasting but balance each other out. We humans detect four basic tastes: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, (and 5th, umami\/savory). Think about those flavors when working with food and wine. - The weight of a dish should be matched by the weight of the wine. Think about a rich, heavy dish with full-bodied red wine. - Medium with medium\n- Light with light. Light white fish with unoaked, light bodied white wine, or a summer salad with crisp white wine. SWEETNESS LEVEL (referring to residual sugar in wine)\n- The sweetness of a dish should be matched to or exceeded by the sweetness of the wine. - Sweet wine can go with savory food. - The acidity of the dish should be matched by the acidity in the wine. If the food is more acidic than the wine then the wine will taste “flabby”. - Wines high in acid: sauvignon blanc, pinot gris\/grigio, sangiovese, pinot noir can balance high acid dishes. Think about Chianti (sangiovese) paired with spaghetti or pizza (with tomato sauce), both are high in acid and therefore balance things out. - If a food is intense in flavor, then the wine should also be intense in flavor. You want the same intensity but not combative. - Intense wines can stand up to fuller bodied foods. - Try complex wines with simple dishes, like a simple roasted beef dish with aged, top quality red so that the wine shines. - Simpler wine with more complicated dishes like a spicy Asian dish with a simple, sweet blended white or rosé. - Think regional pairing. What do they eat where the wine comes from? Goat cheese with Sancerre. Pacific Salmon with Oregon Pinot Noir. Chianti and red sauce pasta\/pizza. - Components that interact\nAlcohol accentuates heat\nSweetness accentuates acidity\nSweetness reduces perception of sweetness\nFat and protein reduce perception of tannin (red meat & tannic cabernet sauvignon)\nSalt reduces perception of tannin (blue cheese on a steak & cabernet sauvignon)\nFOODS TO AVOID, create challenging (but not impossible!) pairings\n- Asparagus- it makes everything taste sweet due to a specific type of acid in it. - Chiles- they enhance things that should be balanced (making wines taste even more tannic, more oaky, etc). - Eggs- yolk coats the palate making it difficult to taste the wine. When in a sauce they are less intrusive. Bubbles work well for egg dishes, so will high acid whites. Folks, this is just the beginning!

Unlocking Food Pairing Secrets\nSo what’s the deal with food pairings? I do believe there’s someone out there for everybody. However, I don’t believe we are limited to only one chance at bliss. Good thing! Same goes for food and drink pairing. Yes, there are the classic food pairings we all know so well – Champagne and oysters, beer and pizza, milk and cookies. I’ve had the opportunity to teach wine and spirits classes in many settings, including as a Chef-Instructor at the French Culinary Institute. So I probably spend more time thinking about flavor pairing than most people. However I do know that pairings, particularly wine food pairing, is one of the most frequently approached subjects when I teach. Here’s the thing: When you look closely, you’ll find that the same flavor components that make those flavor combinations like milk and cookies work so well are universal to all our favorite foods and drinks…you just need to know a little more about how they work together. RELATED: A Sonoma-Inspired Food and Wine Pairing Menu\nClassic food pairing\nLet’s take a closer look at each of the examples of classic food pairings…\nPairing Champagne with oysters works because the acidity in the bubbly and the brininess of the oysters balance each other. And if you’re lucky maybe even enhance other fruit and floral aromas hiding in the background. Beer and pizza rely on beer’s tendency to be earthy, acidic and low in alcohol – and don’t forget those scrubbing bubbles! The cleansing effect of beer can be compelling not just with pizza but with all sorts of rich foods. In addition, earth flavors, like the ones found in beer, are flexible with many foods; more so than many of the jammy fruity flavors of many wines. This is especially good if you like lots of different toppings on your pizza. TO TRY: Baby Spinach and Ricotta Pizza\nBut there are more reasons to love beer pairing. The acidity is a great foil for saltiness and the tang of tomato sauce. And the fact that most beers are relatively low in alcohol means you can get as spicy as you like! And those scrubbing bubbles I mentioned earlier? They work magic with the fatty meats and cheeses we love so much on a good pizza and most casual finger foods. Even milk and cookies have a little flavor science behind their charm. Milk’s natural sweetness balances with the sweet cookies and refreshes the palate. Again, the effect of the beverage makes your mouth ready for the next delicious bite. TO TRY: Dark Chocolate Seduction Cookies\nIn our endless search for pleasure, finding the perfect match (flavors or otherwise) means finding something that leaves you wanting more. When your palate is refreshed and excited you are compelled to take another bite, another sip, linger – bliss! Basic flavor principles for making your own food matches\nHere are some of the basic flavor principles that these and other memorable matches are based on:\n- Acidity gives flavor a backbone and makes your mouth water (and prepare for the next bite)\n- Salt is a flavor enhancer and can bring out fruity or subtle sweet flavors that you may not have noticed at first\n- Salt and acidity balance each other out and complement each other as well\n- Salt and sweet love each other (think salted caramels, chocolate covered pretzels, etc.) - Two sweet flavors will cancel each other out and accentuate any acidity. This can be refreshing when the flavors are in balance, when they aren’t in balance it’s like brushing your teeth then drinking orange juice\n- Sweetness soothes the burn of spicy foods (alcohol, on the other hand, makes the spiciness burn hotter)\n- Earthy flavors go with more… they are the beiges and neutrals of the food world – everything looks\/tastes good with them\nNow go match food! Whatever your taste, there is a perfect match for you. Think about what you like to eat–flavor combinations that you enjoy. Break them down to a few basic flavors and see if any of them fit with the concepts listed above. Then, go forth and explore the fun world of food and drink with confidence in what you know you like, and a sense of adventure for new taste opportunities. Do what makes you happy – that’s bliss.\n\nA successful food and wine wheel complements the sugar, acid, fruit, tannin and alcohol components that create a wine’s flavor with the fat, acid, salt or sugar composing a food’s flavor. Combinations on the wheel may pair the foods or contrast them. For instance, a meal with a rich, sweet sauce may be juxtaposed with a crisp wine or matched with a ripe, soft Chardonnay. Match foods with high fat content such a meat or dairy with a Cabernet with high tannin content. Foods with high acidity, such as seafood covered with a squeezed lemon, match well with wines of high acidity. Wines with lower acidity taste watered down and bland. If salad is to be placed on the food and wine wheel, moderate the dressing, lemon juice or vinegar to better pair with a wine. Sparkling wines should be paired with salty, fried foods. Desserts on the wheel are best paired with a wine that tastes sweeter than the desert. For this reason, a darker chocolate matches well with red wine with some sweetness. Food and wine pairings on the wheel should be matched according to texture; light foods should be matched with light wine while heavier foods are matched with heavier wines. Because Chinese food tends to be salty with strong flavors, the appropriate wine to complement this meal is a non-acetic wine. Examples include Riesling, Cabernet or Merlot. Indian food tends to be heavily spiced, so the appropriate match on the wheel is a wine without heavy oak flavors such as Merlot, Zinfandel or Syrah.\n\nLast week we asked our fans on Facebook if they had a question for Executive Chef Justin Wangler. The response was great, and we got questions about food and wine pairings, best techniques in the kitchen, and favorite recipes. Chef Justin personally read each question and was quick to respond. But because there were so many questions, we thought it’d be best to compile them here to be a resource for our community. If you have any more questions, let us know on Facebook and Twitter, or below in the comments. Cheers. 1. Chef Justin, my favorite varietal is Riesling (on the sweet side). Usually, I have the urge of drinking it with any and every dish possible. Do you recommend against it? What should I REALLY be drinking it with? Thanks! –Daniella G\nIf you like Riesling, keep rocking it. Riesling is a great food wine and often lends itself to the dish. I really enjoy the K-J Riesling with spicy food and slightly sweet dishes. It’s always fun to mix it up and try new things. The great thing about wine is there is always more to learn and taste. 2. Chef, which wine do you recommend for a big BBQ beef brisket sandwich? –Larry H.\nI would enjoy some fine brisket with a Syrah or Zinfandel. The both have some nice fruit but also a bit of tannins to hold up to the rich, smoky brisket. 3. What is your favorite dish for the holiday family dinner? And what wine would you serve with it? –Lorraine A\n4. Is there a kind of wine that is best for gift giving? One that is perhaps more popular than others, –Marianne C\nI like to give Pinot Noir as a gift because it’s very popular, and also lends itself well to lots of different foods. 5. What is your favorite ingredient to use from the K-J garden? –Jessica R\nMy favorite ingredients vary from season to season. This time of year we really enjoy using Fuyu persimmons; we like to call it the “winter tomato.” I really like Fuyu persimmons raw & sliced in salads. Overall, my favorite thing is to watch the asparagus grow in the garden. Check out our time lapse video of asparagus growing. 6. What’s your favorite dish to make for your family? –Meredith H\nAt home in Sonoma county I like to cook wild local salmon when in season. If I sear the salmon I usually serve it with K-J Grand Reserve Chardonnay and if I throw it on the grill and get a bit of smoke on it I like to pair with the K-J Vintners Reserve Pinot Noir. My wife and daughter also love the fatty salmon belly brushed with Meyer lemon olive oil sprinkled with salt and roasted at a low temp in the oven until just cooked. 7. I am always searching for a good wine. I like reds and whites, nothing too sweet or too dry. The best way for me to describe it is smooth, buttery & creamy very little or no bite. I steer clear of anything that sounds like it might have too much oak taste. Any suggestions? –Carol H.\nIt’s sounds like you are describing our Grand Reserve Chardonnay. It has great fruit, light on the oak and a wonderful round, rich texture. 8. What’s the hardest dish\/food to combine with wine? –Marine R\nExtremely spicy foods can be tricky (for example,Trinidad Scorpion Morouga peppers — there are some funny videos online!). Artichokes are a notoriously tricky one because they can make whatever you eat or drink afterwards taste sweet, but they can be quite good when paired with the right wine. It’s fun to play around tasting artichokes with different wines, such as a crisp wine like Sauvignon Blanc, a rich Chardonnay or maybe even an off-dry wine that has it’s own sweetness. 9. Chef, is there an easy way to cut the slices from an orange without getting any membrane and ruining most of the slice? –John B\nSegmenting an orange is a simple process, but it’s a little tough to explain. Here’s a great video I found from Fine Cooking on YouTube.","passages":[{"passage":"And the majority of the time, when you’re serving wine, there will be some sort of food involved. So it’s important to know the basics of food & wine pairing. Right now, there’s only one principle that you need to be aware of when you’re matching wine with food: The lighter the food, the lighter the wine. The richer the food, the richer the wine. It’s as simple as that. For example, red meats, like beef and lamb, are considered to be rich and heavy foods. According to the principle, that means that they would match very well with a rich and heavy wine. Like a full-bodied red wine. On the other side of the spectrum, oysters are a very light and delicate food. So they wouldn’t match very well with a rich full-bodied red wine. But they would match extremely well with a lighter styled wine, like a sparkling wine or a light-bodied white wine. If you only applied this principal, most of the time, you would nail your food & wine pairings. But what about the food & wine that land in the middle of the spectrum? For example, what type of food would go well with a light-bodied red wine or a full-bodied white wine? Well, the answer isn’t a simple as ‘this food goes with that’ or ‘that wine goes with this’. Most foods go well with a few different styles of wine and vice-versa. And it takes a bit of experimentation and memorization to learn what types of food go well with what styles of wine. It also depends on what people like. In part 4, we’ll give you some specific details of what types of wine go with what types of food. For now, it’s sufficient enough to know that light foods, go with light wines. And rich foods, go with rich wines. We’ve just been through a lot there. So take your time with it. Once you have a solid understanding of how to taste wine, describe it, and pair wine with food, you’ll have developed all the tools you need to learn about wine and confidently talk about it with anyone. In part 3 of this guide, you’ll be learning how to put those tools to practical use as a bartender. You’ll learn how to recommend wine you know the customer will enjoy. And then you’ll learn how to serve it like a pro. Until then, remember my sommelier friend’s advice, ‘In order to learn about wine, you must drink wine!’ So go out there, buy a few bottles, and start doing your ‘research’.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:9e75b67f-6e14-4632-a2d7-b5a463d362e0>"]},{"passage":"In this case, look for a large pitcher and transfer the wine energetically, so that the liquid hits against the glass and increases the aeration effect. We call this aerating wine. FOOD AND WINE PAIRING. The harmony between wine and food or, as it is often called, pairing (from the French “marriage,” meaning marriage), is an exciting field where many factors come into play: the physiochemical reactions occurring and how we perceive them through our senses, one’s personal taste, cultural backgrounds, the association of ideas, etc. When thinking about the pairing, we must consider all the sensations which both wine and food produce in us: the flavors (sour, salty, sweet, bitter), tactile and chemical sensations (texture, spiciness), temperature (which greatly changes our perception), and aromas. In general, the majority of pairings are established by association or complementariness: color (whites with white meat, reds with red meat), flavors (sweet desserts with sweet wines), sensations (fatty foods with tannic wines), aromas (smoked foods with oaky whites), or intensity (strong foods with full-bodied wines). But sometimes, contrast pairing – like blue cheese with sweet wine – can yield excellent results. Obviously, there are also foods that are difficult to pair with wine, such as those based on very bitter foods (like artichokes) or very hot and spicy (spices). Don’t think that common pairings are definitive or that there are any hard and fast rules to it. Curiosity and the pursuit of pleasure should prevail. Allow your personal preferences to lead and remember that the combination possibilities are endless. Here are some ideas, depending on the type of wine:\n– Simple young white wines: a light appetizer. – Noble varieties (Chardonnay) of young white wines: white fish, goat cheese. – Oaky Chardonnay: fatty fish (sea bream, turbot), smoked fish or meats, white meat. – Rosé wines: vegetables, pasta, rice, cured meats, soft cheeses. – Young red wines: cured meats, pâtés, medium cheeses, bluefish and even some dishes made with salt cod. – Crianza red wines: grilled meats, roasts, stews, cured cheeses. – Reserva, Gran Reserva, and Vanguardista (“cutting edge”) wines: more subtle and elaborate game dishes and stews. – Sweet wines: fruit-based desserts for lighter wines, tarts with dried fruits for denser wines.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:239315d6-0ba9-4bf3-90ac-f4c007653cbc>"]},{"passage":"Because you won’t be able to describe a wine to customers if you don’t know what to describe in the first place! The 5 principle characteristics of wine are:\n- Flavour Profile (fruit, oak, earth, other)\nThe first element you need to be aware of is the ‘body’ of the wine. The ‘body’ is simply a way of categorizing different styles of wine from lightest to boldest. In general, knowing the body of a wine is as simple as knowing the grape variety. Because most of the time, grape varieties share the same ‘body’ regardless of how or where the wine was made. Red wines are categorized into light-bodied, medium-bodied, and full-bodied wines. Whereas white wines are categorized into light-bodied, full-bodied, and aromatic wines. The difference between these styles of wine will be obvious once you’ve tasted them side by side. But a great way to think about them is to compare the difference between skim and full cream milk. Full cream milk is much richer and fuller in flavor than skim milk. The same can be said for full-bodied wine in comparison to light-bodied wine. With medium-bodied wine landing somewhere in the middle. The aromatic white wines category simply means that the wine will have highly perfumed and sweet fruit aromas. Although that doesn’t necessarily mean that the wine itself will be sweet. The sweetness\/dryness of a wine is referring to how much residual sugar is left in the wine (i.e. how sweet the wine is). If there’s a lot, you’ll describe the wine as ‘very sweet’. If there’s hardly any, you’ll describe the wine as ‘very dry’. This is a characteristic you’ll need to describe with all white, sparkling, and rosé wines. But you won’t need to worry about describing the sweetness levels of red wines as they all have some element of sweetness. Customers will commonly ask you for dry white wines. Even though the majority of white wines are dry, it generally means that they’re looking for the driest wine possible. Acids are what gives a wine its sour\/tart flavor. When you taste citrus (lemon, lime, orange) in a wine, it’s because the wine has some element of acidity. You can also feel a wine’s level of acidity because it will make your mouth water. This is an important characteristic to describe with all styles of wine. All white wines have some element of citrus which makes tasting the acidity obvious. But red wines can have high levels of acids too. But because red wines have higher amounts of sugar, the sweetness balances out the acids so they’re not as obvious (think about balancing simple syrup with lemon\/lime juice in cocktails). The sauvignon blanc white wine is a great example of what a wine with high acidity tastes like. It tastes sour, there are strong elements of citrus, and it makes your mouth water. Tannins are unique to red wines. So you don’t need to worry about describing them when you’re dealing with white wines. Tannins are what cause the grippy\/drying feeling on your tongue and that’s how you’ll recognize them. A high tannin wine will almost make your tongue feel numb. This is an important characteristic to cover when you’re describing red wines. If you’re looking for an example of tannin, you only need to taste a young vintage Cabernet Sauvignon red wine and you’ll know exactly what I mean. This is when a glass of wine starts to get interesting. When I mentioned in part 1 that the astute wine drinker can pick up tobacco, mint, vanilla, citrus, cherry, and even sweaty socks in a glass of wine, this is what I was talking about. The flavor profile of a wine is essential every flavor\/scent that we can smell in the wine. There are a lot of different flavors in this world, even within wine. So to make understanding them easier, they can be broken down into 4 major categories: fruit, oak, earth, and the catchall ‘other.’\nWhen you taste & smell wine you should try and identify any flavors (or lack thereof) from each of these categories. Every wine has some element of fruit in it. Some of these fruits are out there and more exotic, whilst others are a lot more familiar and closer to home.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:9e75b67f-6e14-4632-a2d7-b5a463d362e0>"]},{"passage":"Welcome to Wine by Alex, the show to watch to take your wine game to the next level! Today you’re watching the first episode of #Askwinebyalex of 2021. I’ve got a question from Alessio of @alevalente91:\n« Alex, can you remind me of the basics of food and wine pairing? »\nAlessio, that’s such a great question! I’ve done a few posts about this topic a while ago. And I was actually thinking to do a video to refresh the information. So you’re right on time! Few things to take into account for food & wine pairings\nEveryone’s perception and taste are different\nSome people are very sensitive, others don’t. The same level of sweetness or acidity can be perceived totally differently by two persons. On top of that, we all have our own personal taste. Some people like bitterness, others don’t. Every one of us is totally different. So you might enjoy your pairings, but it may not be the case of the people around you. Food is generally responsible of bad interaction, not wine\nFood and wine have a mutual influence on each other. The goal here is to have more pleasure having food and wine together, rather than separately. And also to avoid any unfortunate pairings. Now that everything is settled, let’s dive into the basics of food and wine pairing! You’ve got to understand there are 2 elements in food that will improve wine and 2 elements that will spoil it. The 2 wine-friendly elements in food: acidity and saltiness\nI’ll start with the 2 elements that will improve the wine you’re tasting: acidity and saltiness. They increase pleasant sensations in wine: sweetness, fruitiness and body. They also decrease the unpleasant sensations in wine, like astringency, bitterness and too strong acidity. Salty meals go with basically every wine and the great thing is that they’ll enhance wine aromas. So it’s all beneficial to you! Be careful to pair acid meals with wines that are even more acidic. Otherwise, they’ll just seem flat. - Think about Champagne, Muscadet, Sauvignon Blanc, Albarino, Riesling, Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo, Pinot Noir,…\nThe 2 elements unfavourable to wine: sweetness and umami\nNow let’s talk about the 2 elements in food that will be unfavourable to wine: sweetness and umami. Not only they increase unpleasant sensations in wine: astringency, bitterness, too strong acidity, alcohol burn. But they also decrease pleasant sensations like sweetness, fruitiness and body… So as you probably guessed by now, they’re quite hard to pair with wine. But, what’s umami? It’s a taste that combines saltiness and bitterness. You’ll find it a lot in Asian food like soy sauce or miso soup, but also in asparagus, eggs, mushrooms and oysters. You need to pair sweet meals with wines that are even sweeter. This way, you’ll increase their fruitiness and balance the acidity that might be increased by the food. Meals that contain umami need to be paired with very fruity wines and, if you want a red wine, choose one that has low tannins. This way you’ll increase the fruitiness and diminish the astringent sensation of tannins. - When you have meals with umami, think about Beaujolais, unoaked Pinot Noir, or Chardonnay from Mâcon. - When you have sweet meals, go all out with a Sauternes, Barsac, Tokaji Aszu or a PX. Other consideration you can take into account\nIt can be tricky to pair spicy food with wine because the spiciness increases alcohol burn and bitterness of a wine. - Think about wines with low tannins and low alcohol. Also try to choose very fruity wines with a bit of sweetness, like Pinot Gris. Similar aromatic intensity\nI said earlier that food and wine pairings are supposed to give you more pleasure than if you were having the food, or the wine, separately. This means you also have to consider the aromatic intensity when you make your pairings! You don’t want to have one element hidden by the other one.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:60947fe9-3ef8-45b3-b03a-ecf8977520eb>"]},{"passage":"A simple approach to wine buying is to match the acidity of the wine with the acidity of the dish. That’s because you don’t want the acidity of the food to overpower the wine. Both white and red wines (depending on the darkness of the skins) can be acidic depending on how they were made (like being aged in an oak barrel versus a steel barrel). Some foods, like chicken and pork, can go with either white or red wine depending on how they’re prepared. Generally, I suggest a white wine for either, and maybe a rosé (often midway in its acidity – thus one of my favorite food wine pairs) or light red, depending on the overall flavor. As for red wines, the skins and seeds included in the pressing and fermentation release even more tannic acids and alcohols into the wines – creating the flavor and color. Remember that with red wines, the lighter the wine color, the lower the tannins. That’s what creates the spectrum, varying levels of tannins. Fatty foods like steak require heavy-tannin reds like cabernets and merlots. Meanwhile, light to moderate fatty foods like salmon or pork can pair well with a light red like a pinot or Chianti. Finally, there’s one more rule for simple pairing… Pair spice with sweet. Sweeter wines, especially whites like riesling, tend to pair better with spicier foods like Thai and Mexican. That’s because sweeter wines help coat your burning tongue (from the spiciness) with sugars. Keep in mind, lower alcohol wines, like riesling and moscato, are also gentler on your palate as you enjoy spicy foods. These are my basic rules for wine pairing:\n- Focus on your taste and what you imagine it tastes like. - Make a guess as to how many tannins are in the wine. Weigh that against how heavy and acidic your food is… lemon mango salsa grilled tuna needs a bright acidic white wine with texture and body. A heavy rib eye with gravy and potatoes needs a dark and perhaps oaked red wine. And in between, say turkey or ham deserves a heavier white wine, a crisp rosé or lighter red. - Pair spicy with sweet. To make it even easier, here’s a list I put together for the most common food and wine pairings…\n- Fish: White\n- Pork: Rosé or white\n- Chicken: White or light red\n- Beef: Red\n- Pasta: Light red, though richer pasta dishes need acidic and ageable red wines\nKeep in mind, these are general rules based on food chemistry. You may find varieties of wines that go better with your meal but appear to break these rules. An old classmate of mine from graduate school at Kellogg once wrote to tell me he’d just had my Eifrig Cabernet Sauvignon with grilled swordfish on the beach. I loved it… it’s easy to see how my reds could balance the meatier texture of swordfish. And the oil and richness of the fish was complemented by the perfectly balanced acids and heavier tannins of my cabernet. Remember… The best part of learning about wine is trying and discovering what you like! The most important thing is that the value of wine tasting lies with you, the individual taster. Spending hundreds of dollars on a “good” bottle of wine doesn’t mean you’ll enjoy it (unless it’s mine of course). The best way to experience new wines pre-coronavirus was to stop by a local wine store for free tastings – often done several times a month. In some places and states, they might still be doing this… just call the store or check its website to see when it offers an event. It’s a great way to sample wine for free and get closer to finding your ideal wine. Likewise, when I’m dining out, I always ask the wait staff what they’d recommend with my dish and then ask them to get me a sip of a couple ideas before I pick what I want.

As soon as I have a link to the video of the presentation I promise to post it here… even if I trip and make a fool of myself! Really, what I want to focus on is that there is some truth to the idea of food and wine pairings and it is not a bunch of BS or “poppycock” as some have alluded to. I am passionate about the topic of food and wine pairing and am on a mission to make the idea less intimidating to people! So here goes. Below is some very basic info on pairing food and wine touched upon in my presentation. Consider this the basic fundamentals in understanding food and wine. FOOD & WINE PAIRING\nAt its core food & wine pairing is about synergy, balance, harmony: The food should not overpower the wine, nor should the wine overpower the food. Key word: BALANCE\nElements in food and wine can complement or contrast each other. - Complimenting: taste of the food and the wine should be similar. The sauce shouldn’t be sweeter than the wine, or acid in the dish is sufficiently matched to the acid in the wine. - Contrasting flavors: sweet wine with a salty dish, or sweet wine with spicy dish. Think chocolate covered pretzels, or salted caramels. These flavors are contrasting but balance each other out. We humans detect four basic tastes: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, (and 5th, umami\/savory). Think about those flavors when working with food and wine. - The weight of a dish should be matched by the weight of the wine. Think about a rich, heavy dish with full-bodied red wine. - Medium with medium\n- Light with light. Light white fish with unoaked, light bodied white wine, or a summer salad with crisp white wine. SWEETNESS LEVEL (referring to residual sugar in wine)\n- The sweetness of a dish should be matched to or exceeded by the sweetness of the wine. - Sweet wine can go with savory food. - The acidity of the dish should be matched by the acidity in the wine. If the food is more acidic than the wine then the wine will taste “flabby”. - Wines high in acid: sauvignon blanc, pinot gris\/grigio, sangiovese, pinot noir can balance high acid dishes. Think about Chianti (sangiovese) paired with spaghetti or pizza (with tomato sauce), both are high in acid and therefore balance things out. - If a food is intense in flavor, then the wine should also be intense in flavor. You want the same intensity but not combative. - Intense wines can stand up to fuller bodied foods. - Try complex wines with simple dishes, like a simple roasted beef dish with aged, top quality red so that the wine shines. - Simpler wine with more complicated dishes like a spicy Asian dish with a simple, sweet blended white or rosé. - Think regional pairing. What do they eat where the wine comes from? Goat cheese with Sancerre. Pacific Salmon with Oregon Pinot Noir. Chianti and red sauce pasta\/pizza. - Components that interact\nAlcohol accentuates heat\nSweetness accentuates acidity\nSweetness reduces perception of sweetness\nFat and protein reduce perception of tannin (red meat & tannic cabernet sauvignon)\nSalt reduces perception of tannin (blue cheese on a steak & cabernet sauvignon)\nFOODS TO AVOID, create challenging (but not impossible!) pairings\n- Asparagus- it makes everything taste sweet due to a specific type of acid in it. - Chiles- they enhance things that should be balanced (making wines taste even more tannic, more oaky, etc). - Eggs- yolk coats the palate making it difficult to taste the wine.

Unlocking Food Pairing Secrets\nSo what’s the deal with food pairings? I do believe there’s someone out there for everybody. However, I don’t believe we are limited to only one chance at bliss. Good thing! Same goes for food and drink pairing. Yes, there are the classic food pairings we all know so well – Champagne and oysters, beer and pizza, milk and cookies. I’ve had the opportunity to teach wine and spirits classes in many settings, including as a Chef-Instructor at the French Culinary Institute. So I probably spend more time thinking about flavor pairing than most people. However I do know that pairings, particularly wine food pairing, is one of the most frequently approached subjects when I teach. Here’s the thing: When you look closely, you’ll find that the same flavor components that make those flavor combinations like milk and cookies work so well are universal to all our favorite foods and drinks…you just need to know a little more about how they work together. RELATED: A Sonoma-Inspired Food and Wine Pairing Menu\nClassic food pairing\nLet’s take a closer look at each of the examples of classic food pairings…\nPairing Champagne with oysters works because the acidity in the bubbly and the brininess of the oysters balance each other. And if you’re lucky maybe even enhance other fruit and floral aromas hiding in the background. Beer and pizza rely on beer’s tendency to be earthy, acidic and low in alcohol – and don’t forget those scrubbing bubbles! The cleansing effect of beer can be compelling not just with pizza but with all sorts of rich foods. In addition, earth flavors, like the ones found in beer, are flexible with many foods; more so than many of the jammy fruity flavors of many wines. This is especially good if you like lots of different toppings on your pizza. TO TRY: Baby Spinach and Ricotta Pizza\nBut there are more reasons to love beer pairing. The acidity is a great foil for saltiness and the tang of tomato sauce. And the fact that most beers are relatively low in alcohol means you can get as spicy as you like! And those scrubbing bubbles I mentioned earlier? They work magic with the fatty meats and cheeses we love so much on a good pizza and most casual finger foods. Even milk and cookies have a little flavor science behind their charm. Milk’s natural sweetness balances with the sweet cookies and refreshes the palate. Again, the effect of the beverage makes your mouth ready for the next delicious bite. TO TRY: Dark Chocolate Seduction Cookies\nIn our endless search for pleasure, finding the perfect match (flavors or otherwise) means finding something that leaves you wanting more. When your palate is refreshed and excited you are compelled to take another bite, another sip, linger – bliss! Basic flavor principles for making your own food matches\nHere are some of the basic flavor principles that these and other memorable matches are based on:\n- Acidity gives flavor a backbone and makes your mouth water (and prepare for the next bite)\n- Salt is a flavor enhancer and can bring out fruity or subtle sweet flavors that you may not have noticed at first\n- Salt and acidity balance each other out and complement each other as well\n- Salt and sweet love each other (think salted caramels, chocolate covered pretzels, etc.) - Two sweet flavors will cancel each other out and accentuate any acidity. This can be refreshing when the flavors are in balance, when they aren’t in balance it’s like brushing your teeth then drinking orange juice\n- Sweetness soothes the burn of spicy foods (alcohol, on the other hand, makes the spiciness burn hotter)\n- Earthy flavors go with more… they are the beiges and neutrals of the food world – everything looks\/tastes good with them\nNow go match food! Whatever your taste, there is a perfect match for you. Think about what you like to eat–flavor combinations that you enjoy. Break them down to a few basic flavors and see if any of them fit with the concepts listed above. Then, go forth and explore the fun world of food and drink with confidence in what you know you like, and a sense of adventure for new taste opportunities. Do what makes you happy – that’s bliss.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:12be2ccc-a20d-4e44-abb2-05b186bffd5f>"]},{"passage":"A successful food and wine wheel complements the sugar, acid, fruit, tannin and alcohol components that create a wine’s flavor with the fat, acid, salt or sugar composing a food’s flavor. Combinations on the wheel may pair the foods or contrast them. For instance, a meal with a rich, sweet sauce may be juxtaposed with a crisp wine or matched with a ripe, soft Chardonnay. Match foods with high fat content such a meat or dairy with a Cabernet with high tannin content. Foods with high acidity, such as seafood covered with a squeezed lemon, match well with wines of high acidity. Wines with lower acidity taste watered down and bland. If salad is to be placed on the food and wine wheel, moderate the dressing, lemon juice or vinegar to better pair with a wine. Sparkling wines should be paired with salty, fried foods. Desserts on the wheel are best paired with a wine that tastes sweeter than the desert. For this reason, a darker chocolate matches well with red wine with some sweetness. Food and wine pairings on the wheel should be matched according to texture; light foods should be matched with light wine while heavier foods are matched with heavier wines. Because Chinese food tends to be salty with strong flavors, the appropriate wine to complement this meal is a non-acetic wine. Examples include Riesling, Cabernet or Merlot. Indian food tends to be heavily spiced, so the appropriate match on the wheel is a wine without heavy oak flavors such as Merlot, Zinfandel or Syrah.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:883dfe3e-d045-43bb-9d06-b2927964c1d2>"]},{"passage":"Last week we asked our fans on Facebook if they had a question for Executive Chef Justin Wangler. The response was great, and we got questions about food and wine pairings, best techniques in the kitchen, and favorite recipes. Chef Justin personally read each question and was quick to respond. But because there were so many questions, we thought it’d be best to compile them here to be a resource for our community. If you have any more questions, let us know on Facebook and Twitter, or below in the comments. Cheers. 1. Chef Justin, my favorite varietal is Riesling (on the sweet side). Usually, I have the urge of drinking it with any and every dish possible. Do you recommend against it? What should I REALLY be drinking it with? Thanks! –Daniella G\nIf you like Riesling, keep rocking it. Riesling is a great food wine and often lends itself to the dish. I really enjoy the K-J Riesling with spicy food and slightly sweet dishes. It’s always fun to mix it up and try new things. The great thing about wine is there is always more to learn and taste. 2. Chef, which wine do you recommend for a big BBQ beef brisket sandwich? –Larry H.\nI would enjoy some fine brisket with a Syrah or Zinfandel. The both have some nice fruit but also a bit of tannins to hold up to the rich, smoky brisket. 3. What is your favorite dish for the holiday family dinner? And what wine would you serve with it? –Lorraine A\n4. Is there a kind of wine that is best for gift giving? One that is perhaps more popular than others, –Marianne C\nI like to give Pinot Noir as a gift because it’s very popular, and also lends itself well to lots of different foods. 5. What is your favorite ingredient to use from the K-J garden? –Jessica R\nMy favorite ingredients vary from season to season. This time of year we really enjoy using Fuyu persimmons; we like to call it the “winter tomato.” I really like Fuyu persimmons raw & sliced in salads. Overall, my favorite thing is to watch the asparagus grow in the garden. Check out our time lapse video of asparagus growing. 6. What’s your favorite dish to make for your family? –Meredith H\nAt home in Sonoma county I like to cook wild local salmon when in season. If I sear the salmon I usually serve it with K-J Grand Reserve Chardonnay and if I throw it on the grill and get a bit of smoke on it I like to pair with the K-J Vintners Reserve Pinot Noir. My wife and daughter also love the fatty salmon belly brushed with Meyer lemon olive oil sprinkled with salt and roasted at a low temp in the oven until just cooked. 7. I am always searching for a good wine. I like reds and whites, nothing too sweet or too dry. The best way for me to describe it is smooth, buttery & creamy very little or no bite. I steer clear of anything that sounds like it might have too much oak taste. Any suggestions? –Carol H.\nIt’s sounds like you are describing our Grand Reserve Chardonnay. It has great fruit, light on the oak and a wonderful round, rich texture. 8. What’s the hardest dish\/food to combine with wine? –Marine R\nExtremely spicy foods can be tricky (for example,Trinidad Scorpion Morouga peppers — there are some funny videos online!). Artichokes are a notoriously tricky one because they can make whatever you eat or drink afterwards taste sweet, but they can be quite good when paired with the right wine. It’s fun to play around tasting artichokes with different wines, such as a crisp wine like Sauvignon Blanc, a rich Chardonnay or maybe even an off-dry wine that has it’s own sweetness. 9. Chef, is there an easy way to cut the slices from an orange without getting any membrane and ruining most of the slice? –John B\nSegmenting an orange is a simple process, but it’s a little tough to explain. Here’s a great video I found from Fine Cooking on YouTube.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:4be44d53-82a0-4184-bccd-8be7baac4647>"]}]}

Bluegrass has influenced many different styles including rock, country, pop and even hip-hop! This list explores the top five bluegrass influences on today’s music scene. The genre of bluegrass was created in the southern Appalachian region of the United States. From its beginning, many genres have been influenced by it. The following are notable influences that are listened to today:\n1) Alternative rock – Some bands with alternative rock roots include Nickel Creek, Widespread Panic, State Radio and Old Crow Medicine Show. Each one of these bands carries the sound of bluegrass in their music. Nickel Creek, specifically, has a lot of folk elements in its songs. 2) Country – The country band Little Big Town got its start in the bluegrass genre. Although they have changed their style to fit mainstream audiences, they still retain some traditional bluegrass sounds in their popular songs. Other notable country artists include Dierks Bentley, Keith Urban and Sara Evans. 3) Folk – The folk band Crooked Still draws its inspiration from bluegrass and old time music. They have released several albums including 2008’s “Shaken by a Low Sound” and 2011’s “Tomorrow Is Going to Be a Brighter Day.” They are very popular in the folk music scene. 4) Pop\/R&B – The pop band Nickel Creek has incorporated bluegrass sounds into its albums for quite some time; their album “A Dotted Line” was released in 2014 and has many of those elements. Another well known bluegrass pop group is the Avett Brothers. They have incorporated bluegrass sounds into their folk-rock music. 5) Hip hop – Recently, several artists have found themselves incorporating bluegrass into hip hop beats and instrumentals. Artists who do this include Jim James of My Morning Jacket, Big Krit and Wiz Khalifa. Each artist brings different elements of bluegrass to their songs. Bluegrass has influenced many different aspects of today’s music scene and continues to be a growing musical genre in the world of music.\n\nEvery man today fits under at least one classification of music essays related to music classifications 1 the classification of film, genre also.

If going on a road trip, choosing the correct genre of music to start out the trip and drive with can be instrumental in setting the mood. Perhaps country music should be chosen to start out the drive. There are some great tunes in country that would fit with a road trip or drive. Immediately, the song Life is a Highway comes to mind. The remake of this song by the Rascal Flatts is a great version of the song, but the original by Tom Cochrane is also a great version. One type of popular music is Gospel music. It is a very popular genre and this type of music is created to demonstrate feelings of spiritual and personal belief towards Christian life. There are different subgenres in this type of music such as contemporary gospel, Southern gospel, and urban contemporary gospel. This genre typically uses choirs and a piano or organ. Gospel can be easily be traced back to the 18th century although one can track roots further back into history. Another strong genre choice is Christian music. Technically any music played in a Christian worship service is Christian music, such as hymns, but Contemporary Christian music has become a popular subgenre of Christian music. It is frequently soft rock but all types and genres of music are there as an option.\n\nHe has released a number of notable solo and collaborative albums, including Cloud 9: The 3 Day High with 9th Wonder in 2006, The Salvation in 200...

The genre of bluegrass was created in the southern Appalachian region of the United States. From its beginning, many genres have been influenced by it. The following are notable influences that are listened to today:\n1) Alternative rock – Some bands with alternative rock roots include Nickel Creek, Widespread Panic, State Radio and Old Crow Medicine Show. Each one of these bands carries the sound of bluegrass in their music. Nickel Creek, specifically, has a lot of folk elements in its songs. 2) Country – The country band Little Big Town got its start in the bluegrass genre. Although they have changed their style to fit mainstream audiences, they still retain some traditional bluegrass sounds in their popular songs. Other notable country artists include Dierks Bentley, Keith Urban and Sara Evans. 3) Folk – The folk band Crooked Still draws its inspiration from bluegrass and old time music. They have released several albums including 2008’s “Shaken by a Low Sound” and 2011’s “Tomorrow Is Going to Be a Brighter Day.” They are very popular in the folk music scene. 4) Pop\/R&B – The pop band Nickel Creek has incorporated bluegrass sounds into its albums for quite some time; their album “A Dotted Line” was released in 2014 and has many of those elements. Another well known bluegrass pop group is the Avett Brothers. They have incorporated bluegrass sounds into their folk-rock music. 5) Hip hop – Recently, several artists have found themselves incorporating bluegrass into hip hop beats and instrumentals. Artists who do this include Jim James of My Morning Jacket, Big Krit and Wiz Khalifa. Each artist brings different elements of bluegrass to their songs. Bluegrass has influenced many different aspects of today’s music scene and continues to be a growing musical genre in the world of music.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:3544afbb-39f7-4c0d-8070-f2e378729642>"]},{"passage":"Every man today fits under at least one classification of music essays related to music classifications 1 the classification of film, genre also.

Daniel Reynolds gravitated towards college rock--like Dave Matthews, Snow Patrol, and Coldplay. It was good back ground music for him while he worked on the computer or the house. He could listen and loose himself in the music and the monotony of the tasks. The music represented his mostly happy and content outlook on life that never challenged him to dig below the surface. Susan's favorite genre of music is pop. She liked anything with an up tempo that made her body want to movie. Music was pure escapism for her and allowed her to dance out any tension she was feeling.

If going on a road trip, choosing the correct genre of music to start out the trip and drive with can be instrumental in setting the mood. Perhaps country music should be chosen to start out the drive. There are some great tunes in country that would fit with a road trip or drive. Immediately, the song Life is a Highway comes to mind. The remake of this song by the Rascal Flatts is a great version of the song, but the original by Tom Cochrane is also a great version. One type of popular music is Gospel music. It is a very popular genre and this type of music is created to demonstrate feelings of spiritual and personal belief towards Christian life. There are different subgenres in this type of music such as contemporary gospel, Southern gospel, and urban contemporary gospel. This genre typically uses choirs and a piano or organ. Gospel can be easily be traced back to the 18th century although one can track roots further back into history. Another strong genre choice is Christian music. Technically any music played in a Christian worship service is Christian music, such as hymns, but Contemporary Christian music has become a popular subgenre of Christian music.

Web3D is often called virtual reality modeling. It provides a way to deliver interactive 3D objects and artificial worlds across the Internet. An example would be a virtual tour of a house that is for sale in another city. You use a virtual reality-enabled browser to \"walk\" through the house, pointing left, right, forward, and so on. The Web3D Consortium describes Web3D as follows:\nWeb3D blends the intuitive human sense of space and time with user interface interaction and programming language integration producing a truly new and exciting technology for the Internet. The evolution of the Net from command-line to 2D graphical to emergent 3D interfaces reflects ongoing, fundamental progress toward human-centered interface design-that is, toward a more immersive and responsive computer-mediated experience. Open languages for programming and delivery Web3D include VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language), Java3D, and X3D. VRML provides an interface that delivers virtual graphical three-dimensional worlds to users of Web browsers without consuming an exorbitant amount of bandwidth. VRML is based on an ASCII file format and three-dimensional modeling environments originally developed at Silicon Graphics. The key to VRML is that the descriptions of objects in the three-dimensional world (not the actual graphics) are transmitted to the user. This reduces the bandwidth requirements and makes virtual reality practical on the Web. Another key feature is scaling, which allows the user to move toward an object and watch that object grow in size. VRML provides information that describes an object, no matter what distance the viewer takes. Although VRML is a coding language, you won't need to do much coding to create virtual worlds. Instead, you create virtual worlds using tools that are essentially three-dimensional painting and modeling packages. VRML files have the extension .wrl (world) and their own MIME type.

You can find all the details and some video walkthroughs, documentation, and other resources on visualstudio.com, and the post announcing Python Tools 2.1 and Python Tools 2.2 beta. In this post I want to talk about some of the reasons to consider using Visual Studio next time you are working in Python. Doing Terrible Things To Your Code\nbelieve a key turning point in every professional programmer's working life is when you realize you are your own worst enemy, and the only way to mitigate that threat is to embrace it. Act like your own worst enemy. Break your UI. Break your code. Do terrible things to your software. This means programmers need a good working knowledge of at least the common mistakes, the frequent cases that average programmers tend to miss, to work against. You are tester zero.

Here are several reasons why:\n\n1. **Physical Health Stressors**: The process of losing a home, whether through eviction, foreclosure, or other means, can lead to significant physical health stressors. These may include sleep disturbances, changes in eating habits (such as increased consumption of unhealthy foods), and reduced physical activity due to the stress of finding a new place to live.\n\n2. **Increased Risk of Illness**: Homelessness or the fear of homelessness can lead to an increased risk of physical illnesses. This is due to factors such as exposure to harsh environmental conditions, lack of access to regular healthcare, and reduced ability to maintain personal hygiene.\n\n3. **Chronic Health Conditions**: Prolonged stress from housing insecurity can exacerbate chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and asthma. The stress hormones released in response to chronic stress can have long-term effects on the body, contributing to inflammation and other health issues.\n\n4. **Mental Health Impacts**: Beyond just mental stress, losing a home can lead to more serious mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These conditions can have a profound impact on overall health, leading to a cycle of worsening mental and physical health.\n\n5. **Access to Healthcare**: Losing a home often means losing access to healthcare. This can result in delayed treatment for existing health conditions, missed preventive care, and a lack of follow-up for chronic illnesses, all of which can have serious health consequences.\n\n6. **Social Determinants of Health**: Housing insecurity is a significant social determinant of health. It affects not only the individual but also their family and community. The loss of a home can lead to social isolation, which is associated with poorer health outcomes.\n\n7. **Nutritional Health**: The stress of losing a home can lead to changes in eating habits, often resulting in a diet that is high in calories but low in nutrients. This can contribute to obesity, diabetes, and other nutrition-related health problems.\n\n8. **Exposure to Harmful Environments**: Insecure housing situations can lead to living in areas that are unsafe or unhealthy, such as neighborhoods with high crime rates or poor air quality. Exposure to these environments can increase the risk of injury, illness, and death.\n\n9. **Financial Stress**: The financial burden of losing a home can lead to increased stress, which, as mentioned, can have significant negative effects on both mental and physical health.\n\nIn summary, the loss of a home can have far-reaching negative effects on health, impacting both mental and physical well-being. Addressing housing insecurity is therefore critical not just for individual health but for community health as well.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context:\nTweet text: Homelessness impairs the health of people in my community. Raising awareness, lobbying policies, and supporting local programs could help. Social determinants of health are the conditions in which people live that have a direct or indirect impact on their health and wellbeing. Homelessness is a significant problem in America, and homeless people experience multiple risks with regard to their health and quality of life. Addressing the needs of homeless people through tailored health and social services could help to improve the wellbeing of these populations. The present paper will outline the issue of homelessness as a social determinant of health in greater depth and examine the role that I could play to help my community. Homelessness is a significant determinant of health as it is connected with many issues that affect health. People who do not have a home often have problems with hygiene and face various environmental hazards contributing to their health problems, including cold temperatures and exposure to infections. According to the American Psychological Association (n.d.), homeless people have an increased rate of infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, and are at a higher risk of contracting HIV. Sexually transmitted infections are also prevalent in specific homeless populations (APA, n.d.). Infectious diseases have a negative impact on any person’s wellbeing and quality of life since they often have symptoms causing discomfort and pain. However, homeless people face more challenges with infections because they are often unable to obtain health care promptly. This may lead to life-threatening health conditions, as well as to chronic health problems, thus impacting the overall health of this population. In the context of homelessness and health, people often overlook the concerns associated with homeless people’s mental health. Psychological conditions have a crucial impact on homeless people’s overall wellbeing and their quality of life. Research shows that homeless populations have a higher prevalence of mental health problems. For example, almost half of homeless women meet the criteria for major depressive disorder, which is twice the level of prevalence in the general population (APA, n.d.). Homeless people also face the physical and mental health risks of drug addiction and substance use as these issues are widespread in the streets (APA, n.d.). It is also essential to note that many people become homeless while already having mental health problems, thus often losing access to psychological help they need. For instance, homelessness is rather prevalent among veterans and can coincide with posttraumatic stress disorder. One critical characteristic of homelessness as a social determinant of health is that it is connected to other determinants, including poverty, malnutrition, and poor access to care. The interconnectedness of these problems is the primary factor impacting the health of homeless people, meaning that solutions to address the impact of homelessness on health have to be systemic and include low-income housing, improved access to care, and employment support. My role in addressing the issue of homelessness in my community is raising awareness about the problem and solutions, advocating for the needs of homeless populations, and supporting policies and programs to remedy the issue. For instance, I could take part in changing this social determinant by contacting local policymakers and requesting improvements in low-income housing and healthcare in the area. I could also spread awareness about organizations providing services to homeless people in the area to ensure that people know where they can get help. These steps would help to improve the health of people who are homeless while also addressing homelessness in a broader socio-economic context. American Psychological Association. (n.d.). Health & homelessness. Web.\n\nDo you believe that your home can have an impact on your mental health? There are many driving factors in your mental state, including genetics, character, personality, and relationships. The environment in your house is one, too. Here are some points to think about. Having a clean home helps create a peaceful environment. That is good for your mental well-being because you will not have to think about clutter all over the house. It gives you a sense of tranquility, helping you rest and relax. Having a well-lit home is also welcome, particularly for people suffering from depression. It is common for them to like dark environments, which could only aggravate their loneliness. This would also only get worse if you make it a habit. Allowing natural light in your house can make you feel happier and more positive. It can lift your mood, leading you to become more productive in whatever task you have at hand, whether it is spring-cleaning the house or preparing for the property maintenance franchise opportunities a friend has offered you. It is also essential that you get a good sleep every night. And the quality of sleep that you get to enjoy is also dependent on the environment of your bedroom. Parts of the Home\nAre you living with your family or friends? If you are living with your family, make sure you have a harmonious relationship. Eat meals together, spend time watching your favorite TV series, and talk at the end of the day, every day. Make it a point to spend quality time with each other. In case you are living with friends and have a hard time adjusting, you can talk to them to sort things out. Some parts of your home, meanwhile, can remind you of a breakup, like the flooring where you used to sit with your partner. This can affect your mood. If you are too affected, right now, it might help to go on a vacation for a while. Another aspect of the house that can influence your mood and health is the paint color. Happy colors like yellow, light pink, and other pastel hues promote a positive and delightful vibe. Dark colors can evoke too much emotion. Choose wisely. Home and Mental Health\nYour housing location can do a lot for your mental health, as well. You tend to feel good when you live in a peaceful neighborhood. On the other hand, living in a neighborhood where crime is prevalent and vandalism is an ongoing thing can scare you off. You can become paranoid and fearful for your life. Lastly, the environment of the house can affect not only your mental health but physical health, too. As mentioned above, the state of the neighborhood you belong to can affect your feelings. For example, some houses have harmful chemicals or metals because they are already old. You can get serious illnesses like lead poisoning. The condition of your mind is somehow affected by the house you live in. Choose to live in a safe, welcoming, and positive area if you are prone to get affected mentally. A beautiful home, even if it is small, can help you think of good things and focus on living well. Live in a place where you can have peace of mind.\n\nI wrote in a previous post how this past summer had been a stressful one. I think most of the time we don’t realize how detrimental stress is to our health. I spent the summer (starting in May, actually) working a part-time job away from home. I had worked this same job from home for three years. The company I worked for was sold, and the new owners would not allow me to work from home. This meant a lot of changes for our household. Just being absent from home two days out of the week meant that I had seven days of home management to cram into five. I came up with a schedule of how to get everything done. It was tough and often meant running late at night. Still, there were some things that were unavoidable with my absence. The biggest of these was missing family time with my children and grandchildren. And then, there was my health. I spent the summer losing two pounds, gaining two pounds, losing two pounds, and gaining two pounds. I was not able to exercise as often or at optimal times. Often, I was running later at night which meant trouble sleeping that night. There were times that I just didn’t feel up to par or felt that I was not getting the nutrients my body needed. My last visit to the dentist started out with, “Have you been clenching your teeth again?”\nHowever, it was not a total loss. I was forced to find more efficient ways to do things around the house. I found an awesome system for our homeschool that is working fabulously for us. I also had to figure out how to prepare salads in a jar and other snacks that I could take on the run. I had absolutely no complaints about my job or the people I worked with. In fact, it was easy money. Still, I had to let it go. It was not something I wanted to do. The extra income was nice. I loved the people and the industry I worked in. However, it was not worth the stress it was causing at home and the time I was missing with my family. My last day of work was November 26, and I’m already enjoying the benefits. My home is more relaxed and less stressful, I’m spending more time with my children and grandchildren, I’m running or going to the gym six days a week, I’m drinking lots of juice, the needle on the scale is steadily going down, and I feel fabulous!\n\nRenters are More Likely to Have Poor Health than Home Owners\nHomes play vital roles in our lives. Home is the place where we rest, spend time with family and friends and the place where we can be ourselves. The house or apartment where we live should feel like a home. When you consider how important a role our home has in our lives, it is not surprising that researchers have found a link between the homes we live in and our overall health. Recent research explored a connection between housing and health by using an objective indicator: C-reactive protein level (CRP) which is a marker found in blood connected to stress and infections. Researchers found that private renters have higher levels of CRP in their blood indicating that they have poorer health compared to homeowners. However, the poorer health of renters may reflect the lower quality of their homes. If the private renters were paying more for their homes they are more likely to be healthier which is a strong link between home quality and overall health. Most renters are not ready to pay too much for a home if it is not necessary simply because they are aware that this is not a long-term solution. That is the main reason why most renters do not live in fully equipped homes. Plus, there is a stress typical for home renters while those who own property are less likely to experience stress linked to housing. Owning a house is a big milestone in everyone’s life while renters feel they are just not there yet. Does Your Skin Affect Your Mental Health? Almost every bottle of oral acne medication comes with a large warning about the risks it might have on our mental health. Brand name Accutane has a label with a statement:\n“Accutane may cause depression, psychosis and, rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide, and aggressive and\/or violent behaviors.”\nThis is not just a myth, there have been a number of high-profile suicides related to acne medicine isotretinoin such as the death of Seamus Todd, the son of the actor Richard Todd, who committed suicide. Some studies have proved there is a link between the use of isotretinoin and depression and suicidal thoughts, it is still not clear whether mental health issues are caused by the drug or the severe acne condition, especially since acne can temporarily get worse after using the medicine. Recent researchers contradict that the medicine itself could lead to suicide and depression. Dermatologists and psychiatrists are paying close attention to any link that can be found between acne and depression especially among young people. The field called psychodermatology investigates how the mind affects our skin and vice versa, if skin conditions can affect our mind. However, the nature of skin and mind connection is far from clear. It is very difficult to study any potential link between a person’s physical and mental health. Some researchers have found the link between stress and skin conditions, but we are far from completely understanding the link between our skin and mental health. Mental Health Crisis Among Soldiers\nNew figures have shown that mental health emergencies account for one in ten air evacuation of military personnel. Among many other issues, soldiers often struggle with PTSD, depression, stress, and anxiety. The mental health issue is the second most common reason for medical evacuation among military personnel, right after limb injuries. More soldiers were evacuated for mental health issues than spinal injuries or heart problems. Evacuations can take place due to emergency treatment which often prevents servicemen and women from carrying out their military duties. Often after treatment in their country, they can return to operations abroad or stay home. The servicemen and women are often under a high risk of self-harm due to their mental health conditions. We often don’t pay too much attention to mental health issues in the army. In the UK, a Ministry of Defense spokesman said:\n“We are committed to the mental health of our service personnel and have increased funding in this area by £20 million. We have also launched an emergency mental health hotline and are working with experts and charities to tackle any perceived stigma around talking about mental health.”\nLet’s not forget that soldiers do need all the help they can get to adjust to a new life when they come back from countries devastated by war.\n\n“It’s important that we think about the continuing effects that this might have on some sub-populations, such as essential workers or racial ethnic minorities… [and] that we think through cultural and linguistically appropriate intervention.”\n‘Financial insecurity, housing challenges ... creating additional stressors’\nAside from health-related fears, financial insecurity is a major factor for mental health — particularly as the U.S. continues to experience elevated unemployment numbers and Americans remain dependent on government stimulus amid the pandemic-induced recession. “I will say anecdotally, we understand that given the COVID-19 pandemic, there are individuals who are experiencing financial insecurity, housing challenges that may be creating additional stressors,” Lane said. “Additionally, just thinking about ways in which to increase social support during a pandemic like COVID-19 is important to consider in the things that individuals are encountering that are impacting their mental health.”\nA psychological survey of 10,368 American adults conducted by the University of Arkansas specifically cited issues like fear about losing jobs, not being able to pay bills or afford food, and “the unique juxtaposition of extreme physical distancing, approaching geographical isolation, coupled with sustained isolation.”\nAlthough there is no one solution to fixing these mental health effects on Americans, Lane suggested regular screening for mental health, substance use, and suicide ideation. “This can be in the form of traditional treatment, but also thinking about expanding use of telehealth as an effective means for delivering treatment for mental health,” she said. “In general, expanding our mental health services in the United States is important.”\nAdriana is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on Twitter @adrianambells.\n\nIn the still, lonely hours before dawn, Karen Gaebelein sits in her living room chair staring out the window at the dark sky—her thoughts racing, heart pounding. At age 56, Gaebelein, who lives in Broadview Heights, Ohio, is worried about the mortgage on her condo, her shrinking retirement savings, her questionable job future. Like millions of Americans, she is anxious, stressed by the troubling uncertainties of the faltering economy. And that stress is literally making her sick. Gaebelein, who has been unemployed for a year, has had trouble sleeping. Her blood pressure is high. She has bouts of depression. “I forget to eat some days,” says Gaebelein, who managed two offices of a credit union. “But once in a while I get a big bag of greasy fast food and a giant Hershey bar. I know I shouldn’t, I know it’s bad for me, but I can’t help it.”\nWhile a certain amount of stress can increase productivity and creativity, too much can be mentally and physically damaging. Not only does stress provoke negative behaviors such as bingeing on junk food, smoking and excessive drinking, it can also lead to ailments ranging from colds and flu to depression, high blood pressure and memory loss. Stress that persists over the years can exacerbate conditions such as heart disease, hardening of the arteries, autoimmune disease, diabetes and ulcers, experts say. Research indicates stress can also speed the aging process. “Stress rarely causes disease, but it creates conditions that make the body more vulnerable to disease. And if you’re already sick or have a chronic illness, stress can make it worse,” says Sheldon Cohen, a psychologist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. “Its effects ... can be long-lasting.”\nStress, he says, “is the perception that you are facing demands that exceed your ability to cope.” The demands can be physical—say, if you’re being pursued by a robber. Or they can be psychological—worrying about a job or money. Today’s economic meltdown is triggering widespread psychological stress, which feeds on uncertainty and dread. “We feel our control slipping and our lives growing more and more unpredictable,” says Cohen. And the mind repeatedly mulls the same questions: What will happen next? How long will it go on? Will it get worse? Americans of all ages are living with the anxieties that a troubled economy brings. But some of the most stressed people, like Gaebelein, have been laid off in their last decade of work, with less chance of finding a new job and recouping financial losses. “Losing your job at 50 or 60 is not good for your health,” says William Gallo, a research scientist at Yale University’s School of Medicine in New Haven. “There is compelling evidence that no matter who you compare the older job loser to, he or she does worse physically and mentally.”\nGallo’s studies, which tracked older people who lost their jobs after a plant closing, found not only that they had more symptoms of depression, but also that “their risk of heart attack and stroke was more than doubled compared with people who did not lose their jobs.”\nGallo says that job loss for people age 50 and older—with its attendant anxiety—should be considered an added risk factor for cardiovascular problems. (When study participants found other jobs, he says, the risk was greatly reduced.) Another finding: People who fear losing their jobs have more health problems than those who actually lost them, says Sarah A. Burgard, assistant professor of sociology at the University of Michigan. She and her team looked at 3,000 employed people under age 60 participating in two long-term studies and divided them into those who worried about losing their jobs and those who didn’t. They found that over a two-year period people who felt chronically insecure about their jobs reported much worse overall health and were more depressed than those who actually lost their jobs. “Living with uncertainty, that’s extremely damaging to your health,” says Burgard.\n\nHow Housing Quality Affects Child Mental Health\nby Will Schupmann\nHomes are where people expect to be safe, comfortable, and healthy. But this is not the case for millions of children who are at risk of poor health outcomes because of problems with housing quality, housing instability, and unaffordability. Although more than a century of observation and research have documented how household triggers affect children’s physical health, poor housing can be equally destructive to their emotional, psychological, and behavioral health and development. Because so many critical developmental periods are concentrated in early childhood, young children may be most at risk, although research finds connections between housing and mental health during other periods of life as well. As researchers strive to understand the reasons for these complex psychological effects, policymakers, housing developers, advocates, and funders should note that housing quality lays the foundation for children’s mental health. What connections have researchers found between child mental health and housing quality? Whether in a city with concentrated poverty or in a rural community, studies have tracked children’s housing environments, psychological health, and development over time, finding connections for children of all ages. Using data on children ranging widely in age, a team of child development researchers found that children from low-income households living in concentrated poverty were more developmentally harmed by poor housing quality than by residential instability, unaffordability, or other housing factors. Children who lived with leaking roofs, exposed wires, pest infestation, and other problems were more likely to exhibit emotional and behavioral problems, which manifested themselves through anxiety, depression, and other internalizations in some children, and more outwardly aggressive behaviors and rule breaking in others. By adolescence, poor-quality housing was associated with lower reading and math scores on standardized tests. Another study, which tracked children in rural areas beginning at age 9, found after 15 years that poor housing conditions—including physical quality, home hazards, crowding, and clutter—were associated with worse psychological health immediately and over time. Similar to the study above, kids expressed poor psychological health in both internal and external ways. Housing quality deficiencies were also associated with feelings of helplessness over the short term. Why do homes affect children’s mental well-being? The path from a physical hazard to a physical harm is straightforward, but what’s behind the association between poor housing quality and poor child mental health? In part, maternal psychological distress. Researchers have found that poor-quality housing may create stress for parents, increase their own mental health problems, and limit their ability to regulate family activities. A policy research brief on the topic clearly states how housing problems can convert a home from a safe haven to a mental hazard: “Thus, rather than being a source of security and escape from life’s pressures, a home with quality deficiencies may add to other stresses experienced by poor families, leading to a cumulative negative impact on well-being.”\nPoor living conditions can also prevent children from engaging in playful and social activities, which are beneficial to their cognitive, social, and emotional well-being. Cramped or unsafe environments restrict children from exploring, interacting with, and learning from the world around them. As one researcher writes, “play helps children develop new competencies that lead to enhanced confidence and the resiliency they will need to face future challenges.”\nWhat are the broader impacts and societal costs of poor housing quality? Having thousands of children living in poor-quality homes leads to detrimental effects for society. When housing problems exacerbate children’s depressive or aggressive behavior, it can affect their peers, contribute to teacher burnout, reduce school performance ratings, and lead to behavior-based calls that pull parents out of work and hinder productivity. And that’s just in the short term. Evidence shows that psychological problems experienced during childhood can reduce adult earnings (by one-fourth by age 50) and decrease one’s chances of establishing long-term, stable relationships. Furthermore, anxiety, depression, and aggression in children can lead to lifelong mental illness, and the economic burden of mental illness is large: the World Health Organization estimated that by 2030, the global cost of mental illness will be over $6 trillion. Poor housing quality is thus a collective problem. Ensuring adequate housing conditions supports children’s healthy development, helps their schools and classrooms succeed, strengthens the economy, and reduces current and future health care costs.\n\nThe amygdala shuts down the stress response and blocks other parts of the brain from regulating emotions. How to stop stress from making you sick\nThe good news is that many of the health problems that come from are preventable. If you want to reap the benefits, you need to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and access to healthcare. These are the pillars of a healthy lifestyle, but there are some more specific busting strategies that can help to prevent and manage. Try to find a happy place. Some people find it useful to create a happy place to retreat to when they’re feeling stressed. This can help to create a mental buffer against the that is causing you so much trouble. Another way to prevent stress from damaging your health is to try to understand the source of your stress. If you can identify the source of your stress, you can start to take steps to reduce its impact. This is a normal reaction to change, but people respond to it in different ways. The most obvious type of stress is a reaction to a negative event, such as getting a bad grade on an exam or discovering your family is going through a difficult financial transition. There are also less obvious forms of, such as work stress, caused by a job that you don’t enjoy or that you’re not skilled enough to handle. Domestic violence is a form caused by the violence in your life. Finally, stress can also make you sick. The good news is that many of the health problems that come from stress are preventable. The bad news is that if you want to reap the benefits, you need to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and access to healthcare.\n\nIt is known to cause or contribute to high blood pressure and heart problems. - It can make the sufferer latch on to very unhealthy lifestyle habits such as smoking, drinking or even drug consumption. - It makes a person very aggressive and such attitude leads to alienation of friends and family. - It hurts work productivity. - It can cause overeating – which may lead to obesity. Well, to manage stress you have to determine your accepted stress levels. If you figure your stress is beyond your acceptable limits, you have to do something about it. Start thinking positively and mingle with positive people, learn a light meditation exercise, avoid confrontations, don’t procrastinate, and above all, learn to accept a situation that is causing you stress and fight it decisively. Else, if you are in a position, avoid stressful situations. But if despite your best efforts you are unable to combat your stress, then seek professional help. To conclude, before fighting stress, learn to distinguish between good stress and bad stress. You have to learn to enjoy good stress, because life without such stress can be boring – it is the bad stress you need to kill in order to survive.\n\n- Age and health issues\nPoor physical health, frailty and mobility issues can contribute a great deal to loneliness. Mental health is another factor with anxiety, depression and fear of rejection causing increasing isolation. Sometimes those who were socially active when they were younger, find themselves more isolated in latter years. Maike Luhmann, a psychologist at the University of Cologne in Germany, has found that loneliness may be worse in old age but young people suffer too. She saw in a study of 16,000 Germans that “Around 30, there’s elevated levels of loneliness, and then again at age 50.” The reason for this requires further study. The effects of loneliness on physical health\nJohn Cacioppo has been tracking the effects of loneliness. His studies reveal that loneliness definitely has a negative effect on health:\n- Lonely individuals feel they are more stressed, even when they are exposed to exactly the same stress as people who aren’t lonely and even when they are relaxing. - They have raised levels of circulating stress hormones and levels of blood pressure. The heart muscle has to work harder. - Loneliness makes them more prone to depression. - Loneliness disrupts sleep and they tend to wake up more at night. They spend less time in bed sleeping than those are aren’t lonely. The effects of loneliness on psychological health\nDr. Guy Winch, Ph.D. makes a great case for emotional hygiene. He brings out the fact that studies have shown that loneliness poses as significant a risk for long term health and longevity as cigarette smoking. However, it does not come with a health warning like the one found on a cigarette pack. He believes that loneliness can cause deep psychological wounds that distort your perception. It has a way of making you believe that those around you don’t care enough about you. You are afraid to reach out because you fear setting yourself up for rejection when you are already hurting. Dr. Winch says that we need to pay attention to our emotional pain. We spend more time taking care of our teeth than our minds. He suggests that just as we practice physical hygiene, we need to practice mental hygiene. This means that we should not ignore the emotional pain that we feel. We should not just adjust to our losses by getting used to them. This is the case even when the loss is a normal one – such as when our children leave home. When we ignore psychological pain it becomes much worse and it can impact our lives in many negative ways. He brings out the fact that people are still told to shake off their depression but we wouldn’t dream of telling someone with a broken leg to just walk it off. Loneliness has to be battled on many levels. It starts at the family level and as family members, we need to watch out for signs of loneliness in our immediate circle and try to help. Practical support can help a great deal if loneliness is caused due to disability, lack of mobility or ill health. For example, offer to drive an elderly relative to a favorite event when she can no longer drive herself. Social awareness of the negative health consequences of loneliness can help people to realize its seriousness and prevent them from making decisions that might precipitate it. An example would be retiring away from family and friends, moving to another country or choosing to stay in a large, empty house. Everyone feels lonely sometimes—when you move to a new place, break up with a boyfriend or lose a loved one. However, chronic loneliness is a more difficult issue and is not that simple to deal with. Chronic loneliness is an interaction between your make-up and what life circumstances you have to deal with. Once it is triggered, your thinking becomes defensive and every social interaction becomes difficult. Offering people suffering chronic loneliness the opportunity to meet with others and socially engage often breaks down because of their defensive thinking. They are trapped in a vicious cycle of loneliness. Being aware of their problem is often the first step towards breaking the cycle. Providing social support is not much of an answer as it often makes the person feel pathetic and does not change their mindset in any way. Teaching social skills is usually redundant – lonely people often have normal social skills but they don’t use them. The reason for this is that when something goes wrong, their brains put them into self-preservation mode. Social cognition is the type of therapy thought to work best.","passages":[{"passage":"Tweet text: Homelessness impairs the health of people in my community.

Psychological conditions have a crucial impact on homeless people’s overall wellbeing and their quality of life. Research shows that homeless populations have a higher prevalence of mental health problems. For example, almost half of homeless women meet the criteria for major depressive disorder, which is twice the level of prevalence in the general population (APA, n.d.). Homeless people also face the physical and mental health risks of drug addiction and substance use as these issues are widespread in the streets (APA, n.d.). It is also essential to note that many people become homeless while already having mental health problems, thus often losing access to psychological help they need. For instance, homelessness is rather prevalent among veterans and can coincide with posttraumatic stress disorder. One critical characteristic of homelessness as a social determinant of health is that it is connected to other determinants, including poverty, malnutrition, and poor access to care. The interconnectedness of these problems is the primary factor impacting the health of homeless people, meaning that solutions to address the impact of homelessness on health have to be systemic and include low-income housing, improved access to care, and employment support. My role in addressing the issue of homelessness in my community is raising awareness about the problem and solutions, advocating for the needs of homeless populations, and supporting policies and programs to remedy the issue. For instance, I could take part in changing this social determinant by contacting local policymakers and requesting improvements in low-income housing and healthcare in the area. I could also spread awareness about organizations providing services to homeless people in the area to ensure that people know where they can get help. These steps would help to improve the health of people who are homeless while also addressing homelessness in a broader socio-economic context. American Psychological Association. (n.d.).

There are many driving factors in your mental state, including genetics, character, personality, and relationships. The environment in your house is one, too. Here are some points to think about. Having a clean home helps create a peaceful environment. That is good for your mental well-being because you will not have to think about clutter all over the house. It gives you a sense of tranquility, helping you rest and relax. Having a well-lit home is also welcome, particularly for people suffering from depression. It is common for them to like dark environments, which could only aggravate their loneliness. This would also only get worse if you make it a habit. Allowing natural light in your house can make you feel happier and more positive. It can lift your mood, leading you to become more productive in whatever task you have at hand, whether it is spring-cleaning the house or preparing for the property maintenance franchise opportunities a friend has offered you. It is also essential that you get a good sleep every night. And the quality of sleep that you get to enjoy is also dependent on the environment of your bedroom. Parts of the Home\nAre you living with your family or friends? If you are living with your family, make sure you have a harmonious relationship. Eat meals together, spend time watching your favorite TV series, and talk at the end of the day, every day. Make it a point to spend quality time with each other. In case you are living with friends and have a hard time adjusting, you can talk to them to sort things out. Some parts of your home, meanwhile, can remind you of a breakup, like the flooring where you used to sit with your partner. This can affect your mood. If you are too affected, right now, it might help to go on a vacation for a while. Another aspect of the house that can influence your mood and health is the paint color. Happy colors like yellow, light pink, and other pastel hues promote a positive and delightful vibe. Dark colors can evoke too much emotion. Choose wisely. Home and Mental Health\nYour housing location can do a lot for your mental health, as well. You tend to feel good when you live in a peaceful neighborhood. On the other hand, living in a neighborhood where crime is prevalent and vandalism is an ongoing thing can scare you off. You can become paranoid and fearful for your life. Lastly, the environment of the house can affect not only your mental health but physical health, too. As mentioned above, the state of the neighborhood you belong to can affect your feelings. For example, some houses have harmful chemicals or metals because they are already old. You can get serious illnesses like lead poisoning. The condition of your mind is somehow affected by the house you live in. Choose to live in a safe, welcoming, and positive area if you are prone to get affected mentally. A beautiful home, even if it is small, can help you think of good things and focus on living well. Live in a place where you can have peace of mind.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:068fded4-f2d5-48b6-9bd7-65181a9f5a05>"]},{"passage":"I wrote in a previous post how this past summer had been a stressful one. I think most of the time we don’t realize how detrimental stress is to our health. I spent the summer (starting in May, actually) working a part-time job away from home. I had worked this same job from home for three years. The company I worked for was sold, and the new owners would not allow me to work from home. This meant a lot of changes for our household. Just being absent from home two days out of the week meant that I had seven days of home management to cram into five. I came up with a schedule of how to get everything done. It was tough and often meant running late at night. Still, there were some things that were unavoidable with my absence. The biggest of these was missing family time with my children and grandchildren. And then, there was my health. I spent the summer losing two pounds, gaining two pounds, losing two pounds, and gaining two pounds. I was not able to exercise as often or at optimal times. Often, I was running later at night which meant trouble sleeping that night. There were times that I just didn’t feel up to par or felt that I was not getting the nutrients my body needed. My last visit to the dentist started out with, “Have you been clenching your teeth again?”\nHowever, it was not a total loss. I was forced to find more efficient ways to do things around the house. I found an awesome system for our homeschool that is working fabulously for us. I also had to figure out how to prepare salads in a jar and other snacks that I could take on the run. I had absolutely no complaints about my job or the people I worked with. In fact, it was easy money. Still, I had to let it go. It was not something I wanted to do. The extra income was nice. I loved the people and the industry I worked in. However, it was not worth the stress it was causing at home and the time I was missing with my family. My last day of work was November 26, and I’m already enjoying the benefits. My home is more relaxed and less stressful, I’m spending more time with my children and grandchildren, I’m running or going to the gym six days a week, I’m drinking lots of juice, the needle on the scale is steadily going down, and I feel fabulous!","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:906c535e-345e-4081-a426-9633b712481e>"]},{"passage":"Renters are More Likely to Have Poor Health than Home Owners\nHomes play vital roles in our lives. Home is the place where we rest, spend time with family and friends and the place where we can be ourselves. The house or apartment where we live should feel like a home. When you consider how important a role our home has in our lives, it is not surprising that researchers have found a link between the homes we live in and our overall health. Recent research explored a connection between housing and health by using an objective indicator: C-reactive protein level (CRP) which is a marker found in blood connected to stress and infections. Researchers found that private renters have higher levels of CRP in their blood indicating that they have poorer health compared to homeowners. However, the poorer health of renters may reflect the lower quality of their homes. If the private renters were paying more for their homes they are more likely to be healthier which is a strong link between home quality and overall health. Most renters are not ready to pay too much for a home if it is not necessary simply because they are aware that this is not a long-term solution. That is the main reason why most renters do not live in fully equipped homes. Plus, there is a stress typical for home renters while those who own property are less likely to experience stress linked to housing. Owning a house is a big milestone in everyone’s life while renters feel they are just not there yet. Does Your Skin Affect Your Mental Health? Almost every bottle of oral acne medication comes with a large warning about the risks it might have on our mental health. Brand name Accutane has a label with a statement:\n“Accutane may cause depression, psychosis and, rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide, and aggressive and\/or violent behaviors.”\nThis is not just a myth, there have been a number of high-profile suicides related to acne medicine isotretinoin such as the death of Seamus Todd, the son of the actor Richard Todd, who committed suicide. Some studies have proved there is a link between the use of isotretinoin and depression and suicidal thoughts, it is still not clear whether mental health issues are caused by the drug or the severe acne condition, especially since acne can temporarily get worse after using the medicine. Recent researchers contradict that the medicine itself could lead to suicide and depression. Dermatologists and psychiatrists are paying close attention to any link that can be found between acne and depression especially among young people. The field called psychodermatology investigates how the mind affects our skin and vice versa, if skin conditions can affect our mind. However, the nature of skin and mind connection is far from clear. It is very difficult to study any potential link between a person’s physical and mental health. Some researchers have found the link between stress and skin conditions, but we are far from completely understanding the link between our skin and mental health. Mental Health Crisis Among Soldiers\nNew figures have shown that mental health emergencies account for one in ten air evacuation of military personnel. Among many other issues, soldiers often struggle with PTSD, depression, stress, and anxiety. The mental health issue is the second most common reason for medical evacuation among military personnel, right after limb injuries. More soldiers were evacuated for mental health issues than spinal injuries or heart problems. Evacuations can take place due to emergency treatment which often prevents servicemen and women from carrying out their military duties. Often after treatment in their country, they can return to operations abroad or stay home. The servicemen and women are often under a high risk of self-harm due to their mental health conditions. We often don’t pay too much attention to mental health issues in the army. In the UK, a Ministry of Defense spokesman said:\n“We are committed to the mental health of our service personnel and have increased funding in this area by £20 million. We have also launched an emergency mental health hotline and are working with experts and charities to tackle any perceived stigma around talking about mental health.”\nLet’s not forget that soldiers do need all the help they can get to adjust to a new life when they come back from countries devastated by war.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:7bd5efe6-f7ad-47a7-bade-485e319ff0a9>"]},{"passage":"“It’s important that we think about the continuing effects that this might have on some sub-populations, such as essential workers or racial ethnic minorities… [and] that we think through cultural and linguistically appropriate intervention.”\n‘Financial insecurity, housing challenges ... creating additional stressors’\nAside from health-related fears, financial insecurity is a major factor for mental health — particularly as the U.S. continues to experience elevated unemployment numbers and Americans remain dependent on government stimulus amid the pandemic-induced recession. “I will say anecdotally, we understand that given the COVID-19 pandemic, there are individuals who are experiencing financial insecurity, housing challenges that may be creating additional stressors,” Lane said. “Additionally, just thinking about ways in which to increase social support during a pandemic like COVID-19 is important to consider in the things that individuals are encountering that are impacting their mental health.”\nA psychological survey of 10,368 American adults conducted by the University of Arkansas specifically cited issues like fear about losing jobs, not being able to pay bills or afford food, and “the unique juxtaposition of extreme physical distancing, approaching geographical isolation, coupled with sustained isolation.”\nAlthough there is no one solution to fixing these mental health effects on Americans, Lane suggested regular screening for mental health, substance use, and suicide ideation. “This can be in the form of traditional treatment, but also thinking about expanding use of telehealth as an effective means for delivering treatment for mental health,” she said. “In general, expanding our mental health services in the United States is important.”\nAdriana is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.

At age 56, Gaebelein, who lives in Broadview Heights, Ohio, is worried about the mortgage on her condo, her shrinking retirement savings, her questionable job future. Like millions of Americans, she is anxious, stressed by the troubling uncertainties of the faltering economy. And that stress is literally making her sick. Gaebelein, who has been unemployed for a year, has had trouble sleeping. Her blood pressure is high. She has bouts of depression. “I forget to eat some days,” says Gaebelein, who managed two offices of a credit union. “But once in a while I get a big bag of greasy fast food and a giant Hershey bar. I know I shouldn’t, I know it’s bad for me, but I can’t help it.”\nWhile a certain amount of stress can increase productivity and creativity, too much can be mentally and physically damaging. Not only does stress provoke negative behaviors such as bingeing on junk food, smoking and excessive drinking, it can also lead to ailments ranging from colds and flu to depression, high blood pressure and memory loss. Stress that persists over the years can exacerbate conditions such as heart disease, hardening of the arteries, autoimmune disease, diabetes and ulcers, experts say. Research indicates stress can also speed the aging process. “Stress rarely causes disease, but it creates conditions that make the body more vulnerable to disease. And if you’re already sick or have a chronic illness, stress can make it worse,” says Sheldon Cohen, a psychologist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. “Its effects ... can be long-lasting.”\nStress, he says, “is the perception that you are facing demands that exceed your ability to cope.” The demands can be physical—say, if you’re being pursued by a robber. Or they can be psychological—worrying about a job or money. Today’s economic meltdown is triggering widespread psychological stress, which feeds on uncertainty and dread. “We feel our control slipping and our lives growing more and more unpredictable,” says Cohen. And the mind repeatedly mulls the same questions: What will happen next? How long will it go on? Will it get worse? Americans of all ages are living with the anxieties that a troubled economy brings. But some of the most stressed people, like Gaebelein, have been laid off in their last decade of work, with less chance of finding a new job and recouping financial losses. “Losing your job at 50 or 60 is not good for your health,” says William Gallo, a research scientist at Yale University’s School of Medicine in New Haven. “There is compelling evidence that no matter who you compare the older job loser to, he or she does worse physically and mentally.”\nGallo’s studies, which tracked older people who lost their jobs after a plant closing, found not only that they had more symptoms of depression, but also that “their risk of heart attack and stroke was more than doubled compared with people who did not lose their jobs.”\nGallo says that job loss for people age 50 and older—with its attendant anxiety—should be considered an added risk factor for cardiovascular problems. (When study participants found other jobs, he says, the risk was greatly reduced.) Another finding: People who fear losing their jobs have more health problems than those who actually lost them, says Sarah A. Burgard, assistant professor of sociology at the University of Michigan. She and her team looked at 3,000 employed people under age 60 participating in two long-term studies and divided them into those who worried about losing their jobs and those who didn’t. They found that over a two-year period people who felt chronically insecure about their jobs reported much worse overall health and were more depressed than those who actually lost their jobs. “Living with uncertainty, that’s extremely damaging to your health,” says Burgard.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:20c82f95-a085-46be-aaf1-c783b3607cc9>"]},{"passage":"How Housing Quality Affects Child Mental Health\nby Will Schupmann\nHomes are where people expect to be safe, comfortable, and healthy. But this is not the case for millions of children who are at risk of poor health outcomes because of problems with housing quality, housing instability, and unaffordability. Although more than a century of observation and research have documented how household triggers affect children’s physical health, poor housing can be equally destructive to their emotional, psychological, and behavioral health and development. Because so many critical developmental periods are concentrated in early childhood, young children may be most at risk, although research finds connections between housing and mental health during other periods of life as well. As researchers strive to understand the reasons for these complex psychological effects, policymakers, housing developers, advocates, and funders should note that housing quality lays the foundation for children’s mental health. What connections have researchers found between child mental health and housing quality? Whether in a city with concentrated poverty or in a rural community, studies have tracked children’s housing environments, psychological health, and development over time, finding connections for children of all ages. Using data on children ranging widely in age, a team of child development researchers found that children from low-income households living in concentrated poverty were more developmentally harmed by poor housing quality than by residential instability, unaffordability, or other housing factors. Children who lived with leaking roofs, exposed wires, pest infestation, and other problems were more likely to exhibit emotional and behavioral problems, which manifested themselves through anxiety, depression, and other internalizations in some children, and more outwardly aggressive behaviors and rule breaking in others. By adolescence, poor-quality housing was associated with lower reading and math scores on standardized tests. Another study, which tracked children in rural areas beginning at age 9, found after 15 years that poor housing conditions—including physical quality, home hazards, crowding, and clutter—were associated with worse psychological health immediately and over time. Similar to the study above, kids expressed poor psychological health in both internal and external ways. Housing quality deficiencies were also associated with feelings of helplessness over the short term. Why do homes affect children’s mental well-being? The path from a physical hazard to a physical harm is straightforward, but what’s behind the association between poor housing quality and poor child mental health? In part, maternal psychological distress. Researchers have found that poor-quality housing may create stress for parents, increase their own mental health problems, and limit their ability to regulate family activities. A policy research brief on the topic clearly states how housing problems can convert a home from a safe haven to a mental hazard: “Thus, rather than being a source of security and escape from life’s pressures, a home with quality deficiencies may add to other stresses experienced by poor families, leading to a cumulative negative impact on well-being.”\nPoor living conditions can also prevent children from engaging in playful and social activities, which are beneficial to their cognitive, social, and emotional well-being. Cramped or unsafe environments restrict children from exploring, interacting with, and learning from the world around them. As one researcher writes, “play helps children develop new competencies that lead to enhanced confidence and the resiliency they will need to face future challenges.”\nWhat are the broader impacts and societal costs of poor housing quality? Having thousands of children living in poor-quality homes leads to detrimental effects for society. When housing problems exacerbate children’s depressive or aggressive behavior, it can affect their peers, contribute to teacher burnout, reduce school performance ratings, and lead to behavior-based calls that pull parents out of work and hinder productivity. And that’s just in the short term. Evidence shows that psychological problems experienced during childhood can reduce adult earnings (by one-fourth by age 50) and decrease one’s chances of establishing long-term, stable relationships. Furthermore, anxiety, depression, and aggression in children can lead to lifelong mental illness, and the economic burden of mental illness is large: the World Health Organization estimated that by 2030, the global cost of mental illness will be over $6 trillion. Poor housing quality is thus a collective problem. Ensuring adequate housing conditions supports children’s healthy development, helps their schools and classrooms succeed, strengthens the economy, and reduces current and future health care costs.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:c5857c0f-714a-43e7-b500-9adade918495>"]},{"passage":"The amygdala shuts down the stress response and blocks other parts of the brain from regulating emotions.

Mental health is another factor with anxiety, depression and fear of rejection causing increasing isolation. Sometimes those who were socially active when they were younger, find themselves more isolated in latter years. Maike Luhmann, a psychologist at the University of Cologne in Germany, has found that loneliness may be worse in old age but young people suffer too. She saw in a study of 16,000 Germans that “Around 30, there’s elevated levels of loneliness, and then again at age 50.” The reason for this requires further study. The effects of loneliness on physical health\nJohn Cacioppo has been tracking the effects of loneliness. His studies reveal that loneliness definitely has a negative effect on health:\n- Lonely individuals feel they are more stressed, even when they are exposed to exactly the same stress as people who aren’t lonely and even when they are relaxing. - They have raised levels of circulating stress hormones and levels of blood pressure. The heart muscle has to work harder. - Loneliness makes them more prone to depression. - Loneliness disrupts sleep and they tend to wake up more at night. They spend less time in bed sleeping than those are aren’t lonely. The effects of loneliness on psychological health\nDr. Guy Winch, Ph.D. makes a great case for emotional hygiene. He brings out the fact that studies have shown that loneliness poses as significant a risk for long term health and longevity as cigarette smoking. However, it does not come with a health warning like the one found on a cigarette pack. He believes that loneliness can cause deep psychological wounds that distort your perception. It has a way of making you believe that those around you don’t care enough about you. You are afraid to reach out because you fear setting yourself up for rejection when you are already hurting. Dr. Winch says that we need to pay attention to our emotional pain. We spend more time taking care of our teeth than our minds. He suggests that just as we practice physical hygiene, we need to practice mental hygiene. This means that we should not ignore the emotional pain that we feel. We should not just adjust to our losses by getting used to them. This is the case even when the loss is a normal one – such as when our children leave home. When we ignore psychological pain it becomes much worse and it can impact our lives in many negative ways. He brings out the fact that people are still told to shake off their depression but we wouldn’t dream of telling someone with a broken leg to just walk it off. Loneliness has to be battled on many levels. It starts at the family level and as family members, we need to watch out for signs of loneliness in our immediate circle and try to help. Practical support can help a great deal if loneliness is caused due to disability, lack of mobility or ill health. For example, offer to drive an elderly relative to a favorite event when she can no longer drive herself. Social awareness of the negative health consequences of loneliness can help people to realize its seriousness and prevent them from making decisions that might precipitate it. An example would be retiring away from family and friends, moving to another country or choosing to stay in a large, empty house. Everyone feels lonely sometimes—when you move to a new place, break up with a boyfriend or lose a loved one. However, chronic loneliness is a more difficult issue and is not that simple to deal with. Chronic loneliness is an interaction between your make-up and what life circumstances you have to deal with. Once it is triggered, your thinking becomes defensive and every social interaction becomes difficult. Offering people suffering chronic loneliness the opportunity to meet with others and socially engage often breaks down because of their defensive thinking. They are trapped in a vicious cycle of loneliness. Being aware of their problem is often the first step towards breaking the cycle. Providing social support is not much of an answer as it often makes the person feel pathetic and does not change their mindset in any way. Teaching social skills is usually redundant – lonely people often have normal social skills but they don’t use them. The reason for this is that when something goes wrong, their brains put them into self-preservation mode. Social cognition is the type of therapy thought to work best.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:89345e5d-dadf-4350-a63b-421d45a16a98>"]}]}

Each specialist brings a unique perspective and area of expertise, which can contribute valuable insights into the child's development, behavior, and potential challenges. Here are some ways in which collaborating with other specialists can be beneficial:\n\n1. **Multidisciplinary Approach**: A team of specialists can offer a multidisciplinary approach to assessment, which considers various aspects of the child's development, such as cognitive, social, emotional, and physical health. This holistic view helps in identifying the root causes of any issues and in developing a more effective intervention plan.\n\n2. **Diverse Expertise**: Specialists such as psychologists, pediatricians, speech therapists, occupational therapists, and special education teachers each have distinct areas of expertise. By pooling their knowledge, they can provide a more thorough evaluation of the child's strengths and weaknesses.\n\n3. **Comprehensive Assessment Tools**: Different specialists may use different assessment tools tailored to their specific areas of expertise. Combining these tools can provide a more complete picture of the child's abilities and needs.\n\n4. **Tailored Interventions**: With a better understanding of the child's needs, specialists can work together to design a more tailored and effective intervention plan. This plan can address the child's specific challenges and build on their strengths.\n\n5. **Support for Parents and Caregivers**: Specialists can also offer support and guidance to parents and caregivers, helping them understand the child's needs and providing strategies to support the child at home.\n\n6. **Improved Communication**: Collaboration among specialists can improve communication and coordination in the care and education of the child. This ensures that everyone involved in the child's life is on the same page, which can lead to more consistent support and intervention.\n\n7. **Professional Development**: Working with other specialists can also provide opportunities for professional development, allowing educators and healthcare providers to learn from each other and improve their practice.\n\nIn summary, working with other specialists in the assessment of a child can lead to a more accurate diagnosis, a more effective intervention plan, and better support for the child and their family. It emphasizes the importance of a collaborative approach to addressing the diverse needs of children.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context:\nTreatment Help, Part 3\nSomeone who has just spent some time with your child should be able to give you a few reactions or observations. It is completely reasonable to let evaluators know that you’d like a few minutes at the end of the session to get a sense of what they think. Always take notes. You may be more tense than you realize, and it may be hard to remember exactly what you did or didn’t hear. Ask to have unfamiliar terms spelled out and explained and request sources of information you can consult. If you’ve had a full multi-specialty evaluation done, consider making an appointment to come back in, sit down, and discuss the results. Keep a notebook. As time goes by, you will think of questions you want to ask, observations about your child that seem significant, ideas for further assessment or therapy. Write them all down in a notebook. There you can also make note of the specialists you see, the tests they do, the information they give. Jot down phone numbers of programs or specialists you learn about from other parents, as well as contact data for someone who isn’t that helpful now but may be in a few years. A notebook will help you track your child and your own understanding. It will also help you use your time with the specialists to ask the questions you’ve been wanting to bring up. Trust your instincts. Go into this process with an open mind but also with a healthy degree of skepticism. If someone tells you something that absolutely does not fit with your sense of your child, consider it objectively. If it’s nonsense, forget it. Don’t let someone who can’t answer questions to your satisfaction pursue a long-term therapeutic relationship with your child, no matter how grand or glorious his degrees or reception room. Don’t expect a “eureka” moment. We’ll say it again because it’s so important: By and large, quirky kids don’t fit neatly into diagnostic categories. The ongoing process of having your child assessed and considering different diagnoses can be valuable if it points the way to helping your child. Still, it’s probably not going to yield a single, illuminating conclusion when you find out what’s “really” going on. Some specialists or clinics will give almost anyone a diagnosis. If you look hard and long enough, you will come across someone who will pin a label on your child—perhaps because it’s the same label everybody gets at that particular clinic. Be especially wary of labels that carry immediate recommendations for expensive therapists. Don’t let anyone prey on your desire to help your child. It’s worth getting a second opinion or discussing the recommendation with your own pediatrician. Most of the professionals you will encounter as you look into assessment and diagnosis will be honorable. It must be said, however, that there is something of an industry out there in providing diagnoses and therapies to kids with developmental variations. This brings us, once again, to our preference for the academic medical center. Finally, don’t forget that the point of all this—the workup, the testing, the consideration of your child by multiple experts—is not to come up with the right label, the right name, the right answer on some cosmic medical-student exam. It’s to help your child—and to help you help your child. Adapted from Quirky Kids (Ballantine), by Perri Klass, M.D., and Eileen Costello, M.D. Reprinted with permission from Random House.

The structure and level of aggrevation the child slips into this part of the assessment can be quite revealing and helpful in planning intervention. Two common examples of projectives are sentence completion tasks and standardized ink blot instruments. Diagnostic interview: A comprehensive interview with the child provides a wealth of strategic information. I happen to use a 155 question interview that I developed for this purpose (although it’s not always necessary to ask them all). The interview captures the youngster’s take on peer relationships, school functioning, factors of home and community and, of course, self. It samples their concerns in their terms, providing insight to areas where they would be most receptive to intervention. All this information is then complied into a comprehensive report that outlines the findings, provides a diagnosis (if there is one), and offers recommendations for intervention. The cost of an assessment like this ranges from a few hundred dollars to well over $1,000. Health insurance generally covers some, if not all, of the expense. Who can do these evaluations? Psychologists can, as well as anyone else trained and licensed or certified to do all components of the assessment. If your child’s oppositional and defiant behavior is causing them to have serious trouble progressing through school, you might ask the school to do an assessment. They have folks on staff who do this sort of thing all the time. They usually have at least one doctorate level psychologist on staff or as a consultant to help with the tougher challenges. Large counties often have a county psychological board (check the phone book) that can refer specialists who work with children. Also, a department of psychology or counseling of a nearby university (universities offer graduate training) might provide assistance or direction. In some cases, they may provide actual counseling or therapy services through their lab programs. Although the services are being provided by students, they are supervised, and they are usually motivated to do a good job. You don’t have much to lose, and the cost is minmal (like free, if they need kids). Keep in mind also that school counselors are required to maintain a resource list as part of their Crisis Response Plan. Ask them; they can probably help directly, or initiate a referral. Then, of course, there’s always the phone book. I believe it is best to find someone who specializes in children and adolescents. Who should do the counseling or therapy? For obvious reasons, it helps a lot if it is the same person who did the assessment. Rapport is already established, and there is no confusion regarding the interpretation of assessment results. Sometimes, however, this is not possible. I get a lot of calls and email asking about how to locate specialists in ODD in different states. Sorry, I’m not aware of any registry like this, although county psychological boards might list specialties. That would be a good place to start.\n\nTreatment For Mental Health Disorders In Children\n- Advice on managing distressing feelings and unwanted behaviour\n- Family appointments to think about ways to resolve problems together\n- Individual therapy for your child to help them understand their feelings and learn new ways of coping\n- Medication prescribed by a child and adolescent psychiatrist\n- Support to other professionals about how best they can help you and your child\nCognitive Behavioural Therapy\nA model that focuses on the relationship between thoughts, feelings and behaviours and explores practical and meaningful ways of working through current difficulties. The young person is understood as part of an organic and evolving system, for example the family. Change in one part of the system affects the system as a whole. Parent Training (Behavioural Therapy)\nThe therapist coaches parents in applying such strategies as rewarding positive behaviour, and responding to negative behaviour with clear consequences and time out . There is increasing evidence that medication can be a helpful addition to other treatments in some conditions e.g. severe depression, OCD, ADHD\nLiaison with Other Agencies\nIt is often important to share information about the child with professionals e.g. teachers, Paediatricians or school nurses, so that everyone is working together. When A Child Is Referred To Us\n- All referrals are discussed by the team before a first appointment is offered. An initial appointment may be with any of the team, depending on the problem being referred. - We would usually see the parents and child together as well as separately, as appropriate. - After this, further sessions with the same clinician may be offered if appropriate, or a more detailed assessment organised with other members of the team. - At the end of an assessment or piece of treatment, we would usually produce a report for the family, which can be shared with others e.g. GPs, with the family’s consent\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat mental health problems can children experience? Whilst serious mental illnesses are rare in children, emotional and behavioural problems are common, for example:\n- Low mood\n- Poor performance at school\nThese may be a response to stresses in a child’s environment, such as bereavement, illness in a family member, or divorce. The child may be suffering trauma, such as bullying. Or they may have a developmental disability such as a learning difficulty, autism or Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). Who are the different people that make up the CAMHS multidisciplinary team? - Child and adolescent psychiatrists – these are medical doctors who specialise in young people’s mental health, including the use of psychological and pharmacological therapy. They have specialist knowledge of child development, the links between physical and mental health, and how biological, psychological and social issues may combine to produce mental health problems. - Clinical psychologists – these have a comprehensive doctoral training in mental health and emotional wellbeing. They have detailed knowledge of patterns of thinking, feeling, relating and behaviour. They can complete assessments that can indicate issues that may affect learning (e.g. memory, attention). Clinical psychologists may specialise in particular therapies e.g. family therapy or Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). - Child and adolescent mental health nurses – these are qualified mental health nurses who specialise in working with young people with mental health problems and their families. They often have additional training in specific therapies e.g. family therapy, CBT, parent training, or psychodynamic approaches to treatment. They usually work in multidisciplinary teams, liaising closely with GPs, schools, and social workers, etc. Does my child need a child psychiatrist? It may not be necessary for your child to see a psychiatrist. All members of our team are highly qualified and experienced, and our nurse and psychologist are able to offer initial assessments. They are also experts in psychological treatments e.g. parenting support, family work, individual therapy. A psychiatrist may need to be involved if:\n- There are concerns about serious mental illness, physical ill-health, or a complex developmental disorder. - Psychological approaches haven’t been sufficient and another treatment, such as medication, needs to be considered. Why does CAMHS share information with other professionals? We have a legal and professional duty to do what is in a child’s best interests, which includes sharing information when necessary. Children will often be experiencing difficulties in multiple settings e.g. school, home, social situations. Treatment may therefore combine clinic-based therapy, parents carrying out behaviour management strategies at home, and support from school. All the adults working together (e.g.\n\nBecause autism cannot be diagnosed with a medical test, screening and diagnosis involves interviews, observation and evaluations. It is vital that as the parent you come prepared when discussing your concerns with your child’s doctors. I suggest you create a timeline of behaviors with dates and take that with you to the visit. Note when the behavior began and how long it lasted, because some behaviors can disappear and be replaced by others. A timeline accomplishes several things:\n- It allows you to accurately answer the doctor’s questions about when each behavior started\n- It can serve as a framework for you to build upon as time goes on\n- It will make intakes easier for you in the event that your child is referred for multiple evaluations with specialists, speech therapists, early intervention, and other providers where you will be asked these same questions over and over again. - It saves you from having to remember dates and details during an office visit where you may be feeling overwhelmed or may be distracted if your child becomes impatient or uncooperative. Pediatricians and nurses always have the best interests of your child at heart, but remember that an office visit only provides a brief snapshot of your child. Sometimes, it can be difficult for them to decipher whether what they observe is typical. Your child may appear shy or anxious in the office setting, and may not demonstrate the behaviors that concern you in front of the doctor. Doctors and nurses rely heavily upon you to report what you observe at home. No one knows your child as well as you do. Trust your instincts and always advocate strongly for your child. You do know best.\n\nAssessment is dependent upon our observations of the children. Anne O’Brien, an experienced teacher and headteacher of young children, explores how we can use the observations we have made to inform the next stage of our planning. - Observing the children as they play and learn\n- Talking with children and finding out what they know, can do and how they feel\n- Analysing and interpreting what you see and hear. Assessment does not stand alone. It transcends all teaching and learning opportunities. It is an important starting point. When you know what the children can do and know, you can decide what they need next. Assessment can enable you to improve your own professional skills. As you assess the children you will discover what is successful and what doesn’t work. You will be able to identify tasks, which allowed real growth and development of skills, and through analysis you will be able to identify the factors, which contributed to this success – and use them again to inform future planning. You will become a more skilled professional. Three key questions to keep in mind are:\n- Why do we need it? - What can it tell us? - How can we use it? - supports children’s learning\n- affects future planning\n- contributes to professional development\n- amend your short term planning\n- inform your medium term and long term plans\n- adapt activities to suit the needs of individual children\n- modify tasks to match children’s known abilities\n- provide children with positive and specific feedback as they work and play. The rest of this article provides a route into how effective observation within your setting can raise the level of professionalism amongst your staff. Staff need to be trained in how to observe, how to interpret\ntheir observations and how to use the information they have acquired to inform their future planning and activities. We all know about the importance of observing children as they play, learn and interact with others. We see how they learn as we watch them. We notice the way they approach a problem. We can identify those who methodically try different ways or repeat their actions after a failed attempt. We identify those who give up on the first attempt if it’s not successful or those who are unwilling to try something new. We see what they learn. We can spot steps towards the learning of skills and knowledge. We can see aspects that are proving too tricky at this moment. So what! If your observations stop there, it has all been a waste of your time. ‘Observations are not an end in themselves but a tool for gathering information about a child.’ (Kay 2005, p90)\nWhat happens to your observations? Are they planned, or are your staff simply looking around and chancing upon a child achieving or struggling? If observations are recorded, how is that information then used? Here are some questions, which will help you to focus on what is happening in your setting. They could be a starting point for discussion with your team as you develop your assessment practice. Are observations recorded as soon as possible? - Carry a notebook in your pocket and jot down your observations ready to be recorded later onto your formal documents\n- Keep a card index file – one child per card – in your room and jot down notes\n- Carry Post-it notes to jot down observations to be transferred to formal documents later\nHow often do you observe each child? - Put the names of the children for whom you are the key worker in your notebook, one per page, at the start of each day. Choose two or three of your children per day and observe them all on a rota system. - Allocate one member of the team per session to carry out observations of all of the children at a particular activity, and share the information later. - Put an agreed number of cards in the front of a file index box at the start of each day, and observe those for whom you are the key worker, returning their cards to the back of the box at the end of the day. - Make a weekly check to ensure all children are being observed regularly. Do you observe children at a variety of activities over time? - Focus on one activity per session, having set up a specific activity for this. - Change the focus activity each session so that you cover child-led, adult-led, free and organised, indoor and outdoor, individual and group activities over the week. Are all staff members involved in observations, discussion and planning? - Observations, planning and learning will be more effective if all members of your team are involved. Do you discuss your observations with your colleagues? - Think about your plans: at the end of the week look through your observations together and evaluate the planned activities in relation to your observations. Did the activities allow the children to gain the skills or the knowledge that you intended?\n\nFinding Psychological Help for Your Child\nLocating a Therapist\nThe way you find a therapist, psychologist or other mental health professional can be crucial to your child’s success, said Dale Masi, a professor at the University of Maryland graduate school for social work. In her recent book “Shrink to Fit” (Health Communications, $10.95), she suggests seeking referrals from mental health workers you know, your primary physician and people in support groups dealing with the same issues. “You know, most people find a therapist in the telephone book,” she said. “I would not necessarily recommend that.”\nGarnette strongly suggests that parents check with their insurance company or HMO for guidelines about what is covered and for how long. When in doubt about a practitioner, she would turn to a trusted friend. “Your best bet is a friend who operates very much like you do,” Garnette said. Once you have a few names, Masi suggests meeting with the doctors without your child. Go armed with a list of questions and get answers about their education, experience, expertise with children, and the specific issues or diagnoses affecting your child. “You should not feel uncomfortable interviewing a therapist,” Masi said. And think about the office atmosphere. Masi would have doubts about a doctor who claimed to specialize in children, but who had no toys or child-sized furniture in the waiting room. “Definitely look for an expertise in treating children,” Garnette said. “Children are not all little adults. A lot of it has to do with how you just click with a person because it’s so personal.”\nGarnette would also seek someone with a few years’ experience because “you do get better with practice.”\nLeman also recommends finding a therapist who wants to help the child, not finish the payments on his yacht. “Find someone who wants to get rid of you,” he said. “If they’re good, they want the child to be well and take off on his own.”\nHe would also check with the local mental health society or board for any misconduct cases against a professional you’re considering. Don’t expect to rely on one psychiatrist, psychologist or therapist alone. Many cases are best helped by a network of parents and professionals working together on different aspects of the child’s therapy. As a result, Masi suggests asking about affiliations when interviewing the initial professional. “If she’s not a psychiatrist, ask what psychiatrist she works with and if that person is a child psychiatrist,” Masi said. For many cases, experts recommend a comprehensive plan, taking in a few professionals. For example, a plan for a child showing severe attention problems in school might include talk therapy with a family therapist, participation in a social-skills group and drug management through a psychiatrist. “Ideally, you want a situation in which all those people talk to each other and that ‘s really difficult,” Garnette said. The situation is made more difficult by current practices in health management organizations and insurers that often have definite guidelines regarding length of treatment and the types of professional care covered. On average, Garnette says, managed-care companies will pay for 10 to 15 sessions, but it’s often fewer. In advocating for her son, she once threatened a vice president of her HMO with a lawsuit before the company agreed to extra care. “They want to cure everyone in four sessions and it’s just not possible,” Garnette said. And ask up front how long the therapist expects his or her work with your child to continue. Even a rough estimate can help you plan for expenses and the effect on the child and the family, Masi says. Traumatic situations don’t always allow for weeks of planning. However, some don’t require a therapist either, Leman says. In the case of a child grieving after a family member’s death, Leman encourages parents to “give themselves more credit.”\n“Why would a kid want to see a stranger if they’re grieving?” he asked. “Share your imperfect self with your child. It’s healthy for them to see you cry, pray, be concerned. That’s OK.”\nGarnette cautions parents to remain involved in the therapy process so they will see if changes are needed. Her son went through five psychiatrists before he found one that seemed a perfect match. “It’s worth it when you get there,” Garnette said. “Your gut feeling is often right.”\nGuinness, M. (2016).\n\nHow does a diagnostician or clinician conduct an assessment for Aspergers? Autism Spectrum Disorders are very complex, yet their features can be very subtle; they are not always obvious on the surface. As a result, an Aspergers (high-functioning autism) assessment will take more time than most other assessments. Below are the methods that clinicians who are new to the field of Aspergers can use as a guide. These are also the methods that moms and dads should look for to make sure they are getting a good assessment for their Aspergers child. An assessment should be conducted by a doctor, psychologist, or psychiatrist who has expertise in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). This is important because most degree programs may only give passing information about Aspergers. A clinician may have a lot of experience in evaluating and may know the DSM criteria for Aspergers – but knowing the criteria on paper is not the same as having the background to really know all of the subtle features to look for. If you are a clinician and do not have the background experience with Aspergers yet, consult with a clinician who does. If you are a mother or father getting an Aspergers assessment done, ask about the background experience of the clinician. Assess each of the core areas of difficulty along with the more subtle characteristics. Aspergers involves qualitative difficulties in language, social interactions, and more stereotyped and repetitive behaviors and interests; however, there cannot be a real delay in language – but it does often involve difficulties in how language is being used. It is not enough to question parents about language delays or social interactions or interests. A good assessment will look at how behaviors are being exhibited. Even if the Aspergers child is social, the clinician needs to look at whether he\/she can take other people's perspective:\n- Does he have imaginative play? - Does he demonstrate sensory preferences that interfere with required or socially desires activities? - Does he approach others and initiate interactions? - Can he talk about someone else' preferred topic? - Can he switch tasks when redirected fairly easily? - Can he listen as well as talk? These are just some of the more subtle behaviors that need to be observed in Aspergers kids who may be higher functioning. This goes beyond just asking, \"Does your son or daughter socialize?\" Use observation in a variety of settings as the core of the assessment. Behaviors can be exhibited for more than one reason. For example, escape, reactions to sensory processing difficulties, attention seeking, and seeking rewards can all be the basis for behaviors. A question on a form reveals that a behavior is being exhibited, but does not reveal why or exactly what the behavior looks like. The only way to know the \"why\" of many behaviors is to observe in natural settings and to spend time with the Aspergers youngster. It is not enough to simply observe the Aspergers child in a clinical setting. If clinicians take the child to an unfamiliar location and put her in a room with grown-ups that she has never seen before and then ask the parent to leave the room, you will not get a good picture of how this child interacts with others. If it is not possible to observe the child in a natural setting, then ask the parents if they can videotape their child during various activities. It is critical to observe the child – close up – in a small playgroup. Observing play and social interactions may look good from a distance; however, when the clinician can (a) hear everything that is being said, (b) follow the child’s eyes, (c) see how he responds to interruptions and so forth, then the clinician can really assess the details of those interactions and begin to interpret them as possibly on the spectrum or not. The clinician can also tell if the child’s play is “parallel play” or if it is really “cooperative play.” Observations not only support the diagnosis, but they are essential in order to give individualized, rather than generic, recommendations. Clinicians should pair observations with interviews, ratings scales and direct assessment. One rating scale alone should not be the actual assessment. However, rating scales should be given to support observations. If the results do match what is being observed, then check to make sure that the rating scales were completed correctly and ask the rater for examples of what was being rated high in the scales. For example, a behavior could be rated as being \"frequently\" observed.\n\nThey went on to say the program team is the practical place to support this discussion as the teams “sit down and do some brainstorming and SWOT analysis and stuff like that.” This member recommended more time to support these discussions would be beneficial. One challenge that may prevent specialist interaction with agents is that often work is done around district structures and meetings in which specialists are not always present. A member of the team said, “One of the challenges I’ve seen is sometimes we do things around district meetings and things like that. And then specialists don't necessarily know about them and don't really feel like that's something that they can easily plug into.” Some of the districts do host special planning meetings where they invite specialists. Another team member said,\nI know, like, for example, with our planning district meetings, we have one a year that if there's some things going on, or there's been a hot topic, we do this-usually late summer. If there's been something hot going on in the summer, we'll invite those specialists to give us a summary and we can talk about what we can do the next year. And this, that, and the other and, most of the AREC people. But, I wonder if we need to look at some of that on a different level. Another member of the team spoke about the variability within VCE and how this makes this situation more challenging. He said,\nWe have specialists, like you mentioned it, at an AREC, particularly in ag areas that are very client oriented - to the grower level. But then I know other specialists that are more, I guess I’d say higher level - that work with companies or work with topics - solar energy, or something like that and maybe then they're not so many individual people on the ground at a higher level. I know when community viability was around, [a specialist] worked a lot with whole counties, that whole region regional planning district. So that's the thing with Extension. We're not a one- size-fits-all kind of organization. So there probably are specialists that don't maybe work with 107 county agents - locality agents. That's just maybe not the nature of their work. But for the ones that do want to for sure I hope we can provide this opportunity. Both agents and specialists need to understand each other’s roles, another member of the team emphasized. Maybe it needs to come from both sides of what specialist see, maybe they can see what agents do maybe merge that information together somewhere that's kind of like relevant with the new technology age. We don't know what each other does sometimes and how we can actually benefit from each other, so I’m not sure how to make that connection work. Interactions occur, but don’t always support the types of discussions that need to take place to move VCE forward. Being able to do this would “expand the horizons” of the organization. A team member said,\nBut how can we, as an organization, connect the agents in the specialists in. And I know we do a lot of things, but how could we do it in a manner to where we can discuss some of these. The things like the situation analysis. Usually, when we're connecting we're connecting in a field day, over special project or connecting at a 4-H function - understand what I’m saying? But how can we connect and with more than just our little net, our little group, how can we expand that I guess, for everybody. How would that? What would what would be a means to be able to do that to expand our horizons I guess. Another agent on the team said they have a group of specialists they work with regularly. But, she asked, “How do we get outside our comfort zone and engage with other specialist? And how do we get specialist out of their comfort zone and engage with some of the agents, maybe they don’t know?” Program teams provide “camaraderie” but there may be other relationships outside the program teams that could be beneficial. A member of the team talked about a specialists fair that was held in the past as part of winter in-service. She said,\nI think it's been four or five years ago the departments went and set out posters, and then the agents could visit. And that was supposed to kind of help. But, there weren't a lot of agents that came to chat about what was going on in programs. But then again that might be the comfort question. But the other thing I wonder, also in that scenario your kind of setting it up where it's the agents coming to find the specialist.\n\nSeven Simple Steps for Successful End-of-the-Year Assessment\nWith this guide, you'll create an assessment that leaves you organized and prepared to add and modify for next year. - Grades: PreK–K, 1–2, 3–5\nLate spring is a good time to begin thinking ahead to next year. A comprehensive process of program and individual assessment can take up to six weeks. Starting early will allow plenty of time to plan and discuss all the components and strategize goals. As you begin this process, start with a comprehensive assessment and evaluation of the year as a whole. The process of program assessment has several components. A comprehensive end-of the-year assessment should include all the individuals and groups who are involved, such as program administrators, education coordinators, teachers, parents, and children. Don't forget the children! Their opinions may surprise and delight you. Reflecting on the work of this year will allow you to set goals that will strengthen your program in the coming year. Consider these seven steps, ideas, and resources. Start now. Experienced early childhood professionals know the end of the year is ab time. Unexpected events can require attention that may take your mind off this important process. Starting two months ahead will give you time to be thorough and detailed (and get temporarily distracted!). Plan carefully. Think about what you want to know. Ask for feedback and input from all stakeholders, plan the strategies and questions, and then execute your plan. Keep in mind that when you ask a question can influence the responses you get. Start the process when other deadlines or priorities will not conflict and allow several days for people to get involved and for comments to filter in. Vary the method. Written surveys are only one way of getting information. Try personal gatherings around some simple refreshments at the end of the day, use a few minutes in another meeting to ask a couple of questions, post a question on a chart in the hallway and attach a pen or marker, and engage in informal one-on-one discussions. Make sure to document ideas that come from these conversations quickly so they are not lost. Delegate. Ask for help coordinating the information gathering. Parents could communicate and compile their groups' responses. One or two teachers could work to gather information from teachers and staff. An older group of school-age children could assist in getting responses from preschool children. Request that a member of each group summarize the information gathered and list the recommendations. Set goals. Discuss responses with each group. Identify goals for next year by area of the program or curriculum. What additions are needed to the curriculum? What strategies can be used to improve staff development? How can we enhance the education, the services, or the program for teachers and parents? What are children interested in learning about? What community programs or initiatives could be integrated into your curriculum and program next year? Create an action plan. Here's where everyone gets involved to agree on specific strategies that will be the focus for next year. A frequent problem with this stage of assessment occurs when the action plan has too many strategies. Keep the plan simple and specific. Try starting with no more than two strategies for each area. When those are accomplished, add more. What new curriculum ideas will be added? List by classroom so that each teacher is focused on a few specific goals. Will new equipment or materials be purchased? Share the vision. Gather everyone together. Share the successes and accomplishments made over the past year. The goals and strategies you have established for the coming year are your vision for the future. This can be done in many different and fun ways. Teachers can share personal growth, children can share projects from the year, and everyone can enjoy a picnic or potluck meal. As you all work together to assess your accomplishments this year, you will be organized and prepared to add and modify for next year. This process, done yearly, will be a productive and positive experience for everyone involved. Seeing the positive changes and growth take place from one year to the next in the curriculum, program, and for teachers and parents is one of the most rewarding parts of working in early childhood education. Sample Assessment Questions\nFor administrators. How well did the program meet the goals established at the beginning of the year? Did you see growth in your program, as well as in children and families, throughout the year? Did teachers and staff grow professionally? What specific example can you identify? How will you continue to provide professional growth and education for teachers and families? Were new community resources used this year? Did you link with any new organizations or groups? Did you grow professionally? For parents.\n\nSet boundaries around what you can offer and be clear with yourself and your organisation about what you cannot offer and which other individuals or organisations can be used for help. Don’t try to work alone. Do what you can to encourage children’s parents or encourage young people to seek professional help such as counseling. As I mentioned before I’ve asked my friend Anna to give you some advice on what to do when witnessing self-harm or when to seek help when self-harm. This is what Anna said:\nIf you would like to contact Anna then I’ve placed links below this video. So how to behave and what to do? Self-educate as much you can about self-harm – the more you understand the better. Do not think that the problem will go away. If you work with children and young people, at some point one of them will self-harm. In my school career, I had 3 different cases of self-harming and I was working mainly in the mainstream primary setting\nYou will need the support of your organisation as you cannot act in isolation. Look after yourself – it is hard to support someone if you are feeling overwhelmed. Make sure you also have a source of support for yourself. It is fine, to be honest about your own fears. Staff who have contact with children\/young people who self-harm in their setting should be provided with appropriate training to understand but also to offer support. Educational staff can work around children coping skills, self-esteem, self-care, resiliency, and teaching them to problem solve as well as encouraging children and young people to seek individual therapy. Assessment of Needs should be offered to all people who have self-harmed and the risk assessment of further self-harm and\/or suicide should be identified. Ok. There you have it! I hope that you enjoyed this video and the quiz today and I’m looking forward to hearing from you. After you’ve finished, please join the discussion below. Tell me what you would like me to cover in my VLOGs please. Don’t forget to like and subscribe. I will see you next Thursday. Anna’s website: https:\/\/www.apf-wellness.co.uk\/","passages":[{"passage":"Treatment Help, Part 3\nSomeone who has just spent some time with your child should be able to give you a few reactions or observations. It is completely reasonable to let evaluators know that you’d like a few minutes at the end of the session to get a sense of what they think. Always take notes. You may be more tense than you realize, and it may be hard to remember exactly what you did or didn’t hear. Ask to have unfamiliar terms spelled out and explained and request sources of information you can consult. If you’ve had a full multi-specialty evaluation done, consider making an appointment to come back in, sit down, and discuss the results. Keep a notebook. As time goes by, you will think of questions you want to ask, observations about your child that seem significant, ideas for further assessment or therapy. Write them all down in a notebook. There you can also make note of the specialists you see, the tests they do, the information they give. Jot down phone numbers of programs or specialists you learn about from other parents, as well as contact data for someone who isn’t that helpful now but may be in a few years. A notebook will help you track your child and your own understanding. It will also help you use your time with the specialists to ask the questions you’ve been wanting to bring up. Trust your instincts. Go into this process with an open mind but also with a healthy degree of skepticism. If someone tells you something that absolutely does not fit with your sense of your child, consider it objectively. If it’s nonsense, forget it. Don’t let someone who can’t answer questions to your satisfaction pursue a long-term therapeutic relationship with your child, no matter how grand or glorious his degrees or reception room. Don’t expect a “eureka” moment. We’ll say it again because it’s so important: By and large, quirky kids don’t fit neatly into diagnostic categories. The ongoing process of having your child assessed and considering different diagnoses can be valuable if it points the way to helping your child. Still, it’s probably not going to yield a single, illuminating conclusion when you find out what’s “really” going on. Some specialists or clinics will give almost anyone a diagnosis. If you look hard and long enough, you will come across someone who will pin a label on your child—perhaps because it’s the same label everybody gets at that particular clinic. Be especially wary of labels that carry immediate recommendations for expensive therapists. Don’t let anyone prey on your desire to help your child. It’s worth getting a second opinion or discussing the recommendation with your own pediatrician. Most of the professionals you will encounter as you look into assessment and diagnosis will be honorable. It must be said, however, that there is something of an industry out there in providing diagnoses and therapies to kids with developmental variations. This brings us, once again, to our preference for the academic medical center. Finally, don’t forget that the point of all this—the workup, the testing, the consideration of your child by multiple experts—is not to come up with the right label, the right name, the right answer on some cosmic medical-student exam. It’s to help your child—and to help you help your child. Adapted from Quirky Kids (Ballantine), by Perri Klass, M.D., and Eileen Costello, M.D. Reprinted with permission from Random House.

The structure and level of aggrevation the child slips into this part of the assessment can be quite revealing and helpful in planning intervention. Two common examples of projectives are sentence completion tasks and standardized ink blot instruments. Diagnostic interview: A comprehensive interview with the child provides a wealth of strategic information. I happen to use a 155 question interview that I developed for this purpose (although it’s not always necessary to ask them all). The interview captures the youngster’s take on peer relationships, school functioning, factors of home and community and, of course, self. It samples their concerns in their terms, providing insight to areas where they would be most receptive to intervention. All this information is then complied into a comprehensive report that outlines the findings, provides a diagnosis (if there is one), and offers recommendations for intervention. The cost of an assessment like this ranges from a few hundred dollars to well over $1,000. Health insurance generally covers some, if not all, of the expense. Who can do these evaluations? Psychologists can, as well as anyone else trained and licensed or certified to do all components of the assessment. If your child’s oppositional and defiant behavior is causing them to have serious trouble progressing through school, you might ask the school to do an assessment. They have folks on staff who do this sort of thing all the time. They usually have at least one doctorate level psychologist on staff or as a consultant to help with the tougher challenges. Large counties often have a county psychological board (check the phone book) that can refer specialists who work with children. Also, a department of psychology or counseling of a nearby university (universities offer graduate training) might provide assistance or direction. In some cases, they may provide actual counseling or therapy services through their lab programs. Although the services are being provided by students, they are supervised, and they are usually motivated to do a good job. You don’t have much to lose, and the cost is minmal (like free, if they need kids). Keep in mind also that school counselors are required to maintain a resource list as part of their Crisis Response Plan. Ask them; they can probably help directly, or initiate a referral. Then, of course, there’s always the phone book. I believe it is best to find someone who specializes in children and adolescents. Who should do the counseling or therapy? For obvious reasons, it helps a lot if it is the same person who did the assessment. Rapport is already established, and there is no confusion regarding the interpretation of assessment results. Sometimes, however, this is not possible. I get a lot of calls and email asking about how to locate specialists in ODD in different states. Sorry, I’m not aware of any registry like this, although county psychological boards might list specialties. That would be a good place to start.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:bf776d14-d370-416f-8a38-a212eb6bbf28>"]},{"passage":"Treatment For Mental Health Disorders In Children\n- Advice on managing distressing feelings and unwanted behaviour\n- Family appointments to think about ways to resolve problems together\n- Individual therapy for your child to help them understand their feelings and learn new ways of coping\n- Medication prescribed by a child and adolescent psychiatrist\n- Support to other professionals about how best they can help you and your child\nCognitive Behavioural Therapy\nA model that focuses on the relationship between thoughts, feelings and behaviours and explores practical and meaningful ways of working through current difficulties. The young person is understood as part of an organic and evolving system, for example the family. Change in one part of the system affects the system as a whole. Parent Training (Behavioural Therapy)\nThe therapist coaches parents in applying such strategies as rewarding positive behaviour, and responding to negative behaviour with clear consequences and time out . There is increasing evidence that medication can be a helpful addition to other treatments in some conditions e.g. severe depression, OCD, ADHD\nLiaison with Other Agencies\nIt is often important to share information about the child with professionals e.g. teachers, Paediatricians or school nurses, so that everyone is working together. When A Child Is Referred To Us\n- All referrals are discussed by the team before a first appointment is offered. An initial appointment may be with any of the team, depending on the problem being referred. - We would usually see the parents and child together as well as separately, as appropriate. - After this, further sessions with the same clinician may be offered if appropriate, or a more detailed assessment organised with other members of the team. - At the end of an assessment or piece of treatment, we would usually produce a report for the family, which can be shared with others e.g. GPs, with the family’s consent\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat mental health problems can children experience? Whilst serious mental illnesses are rare in children, emotional and behavioural problems are common, for example:\n- Low mood\n- Poor performance at school\nThese may be a response to stresses in a child’s environment, such as bereavement, illness in a family member, or divorce. The child may be suffering trauma, such as bullying. Or they may have a developmental disability such as a learning difficulty, autism or Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). Who are the different people that make up the CAMHS multidisciplinary team? - Child and adolescent psychiatrists – these are medical doctors who specialise in young people’s mental health, including the use of psychological and pharmacological therapy. They have specialist knowledge of child development, the links between physical and mental health, and how biological, psychological and social issues may combine to produce mental health problems. - Clinical psychologists – these have a comprehensive doctoral training in mental health and emotional wellbeing. They have detailed knowledge of patterns of thinking, feeling, relating and behaviour. They can complete assessments that can indicate issues that may affect learning (e.g. memory, attention). Clinical psychologists may specialise in particular therapies e.g. family therapy or Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). - Child and adolescent mental health nurses – these are qualified mental health nurses who specialise in working with young people with mental health problems and their families. They often have additional training in specific therapies e.g. family therapy, CBT, parent training, or psychodynamic approaches to treatment. They usually work in multidisciplinary teams, liaising closely with GPs, schools, and social workers, etc. Does my child need a child psychiatrist? It may not be necessary for your child to see a psychiatrist. All members of our team are highly qualified and experienced, and our nurse and psychologist are able to offer initial assessments. They are also experts in psychological treatments e.g. parenting support, family work, individual therapy. A psychiatrist may need to be involved if:\n- There are concerns about serious mental illness, physical ill-health, or a complex developmental disorder. - Psychological approaches haven’t been sufficient and another treatment, such as medication, needs to be considered. Why does CAMHS share information with other professionals? We have a legal and professional duty to do what is in a child’s best interests, which includes sharing information when necessary. Children will often be experiencing difficulties in multiple settings e.g. school, home, social situations. Treatment may therefore combine clinic-based therapy, parents carrying out behaviour management strategies at home, and support from school.

It is vital that as the parent you come prepared when discussing your concerns with your child’s doctors. I suggest you create a timeline of behaviors with dates and take that with you to the visit. Note when the behavior began and how long it lasted, because some behaviors can disappear and be replaced by others. A timeline accomplishes several things:\n- It allows you to accurately answer the doctor’s questions about when each behavior started\n- It can serve as a framework for you to build upon as time goes on\n- It will make intakes easier for you in the event that your child is referred for multiple evaluations with specialists, speech therapists, early intervention, and other providers where you will be asked these same questions over and over again. - It saves you from having to remember dates and details during an office visit where you may be feeling overwhelmed or may be distracted if your child becomes impatient or uncooperative. Pediatricians and nurses always have the best interests of your child at heart, but remember that an office visit only provides a brief snapshot of your child. Sometimes, it can be difficult for them to decipher whether what they observe is typical. Your child may appear shy or anxious in the office setting, and may not demonstrate the behaviors that concern you in front of the doctor. Doctors and nurses rely heavily upon you to report what you observe at home. No one knows your child as well as you do. Trust your instincts and always advocate strongly for your child.

Anne O’Brien, an experienced teacher and headteacher of young children, explores how we can use the observations we have made to inform the next stage of our planning. - Observing the children as they play and learn\n- Talking with children and finding out what they know, can do and how they feel\n- Analysing and interpreting what you see and hear. Assessment does not stand alone. It transcends all teaching and learning opportunities. It is an important starting point. When you know what the children can do and know, you can decide what they need next. Assessment can enable you to improve your own professional skills. As you assess the children you will discover what is successful and what doesn’t work. You will be able to identify tasks, which allowed real growth and development of skills, and through analysis you will be able to identify the factors, which contributed to this success – and use them again to inform future planning. You will become a more skilled professional. Three key questions to keep in mind are:\n- Why do we need it? - What can it tell us? - How can we use it? - supports children’s learning\n- affects future planning\n- contributes to professional development\n- amend your short term planning\n- inform your medium term and long term plans\n- adapt activities to suit the needs of individual children\n- modify tasks to match children’s known abilities\n- provide children with positive and specific feedback as they work and play. The rest of this article provides a route into how effective observation within your setting can raise the level of professionalism amongst your staff. Staff need to be trained in how to observe, how to interpret\ntheir observations and how to use the information they have acquired to inform their future planning and activities. We all know about the importance of observing children as they play, learn and interact with others. We see how they learn as we watch them. We notice the way they approach a problem. We can identify those who methodically try different ways or repeat their actions after a failed attempt. We identify those who give up on the first attempt if it’s not successful or those who are unwilling to try something new. We see what they learn. We can spot steps towards the learning of skills and knowledge. We can see aspects that are proving too tricky at this moment. So what! If your observations stop there, it has all been a waste of your time. ‘Observations are not an end in themselves but a tool for gathering information about a child.’ (Kay 2005, p90)\nWhat happens to your observations? Are they planned, or are your staff simply looking around and chancing upon a child achieving or struggling? If observations are recorded, how is that information then used? Here are some questions, which will help you to focus on what is happening in your setting. They could be a starting point for discussion with your team as you develop your assessment practice. Are observations recorded as soon as possible? - Carry a notebook in your pocket and jot down your observations ready to be recorded later onto your formal documents\n- Keep a card index file – one child per card – in your room and jot down notes\n- Carry Post-it notes to jot down observations to be transferred to formal documents later\nHow often do you observe each child? - Put the names of the children for whom you are the key worker in your notebook, one per page, at the start of each day. Choose two or three of your children per day and observe them all on a rota system. - Allocate one member of the team per session to carry out observations of all of the children at a particular activity, and share the information later. - Put an agreed number of cards in the front of a file index box at the start of each day, and observe those for whom you are the key worker, returning their cards to the back of the box at the end of the day. - Make a weekly check to ensure all children are being observed regularly. Do you observe children at a variety of activities over time? - Focus on one activity per session, having set up a specific activity for this. - Change the focus activity each session so that you cover child-led, adult-led, free and organised, indoor and outdoor, individual and group activities over the week. Are all staff members involved in observations, discussion and planning? - Observations, planning and learning will be more effective if all members of your team are involved. Do you discuss your observations with your colleagues? - Think about your plans: at the end of the week look through your observations together and evaluate the planned activities in relation to your observations. Did the activities allow the children to gain the skills or the knowledge that you intended?","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:61e7bcf5-822f-47ce-9415-e1eca44301cd>"]},{"passage":"Finding Psychological Help for Your Child\nLocating a Therapist\nThe way you find a therapist, psychologist or other mental health professional can be crucial to your child’s success, said Dale Masi, a professor at the University of Maryland graduate school for social work. In her recent book “Shrink to Fit” (Health Communications, $10.95), she suggests seeking referrals from mental health workers you know, your primary physician and people in support groups dealing with the same issues. “You know, most people find a therapist in the telephone book,” she said. “I would not necessarily recommend that.”\nGarnette strongly suggests that parents check with their insurance company or HMO for guidelines about what is covered and for how long. When in doubt about a practitioner, she would turn to a trusted friend. “Your best bet is a friend who operates very much like you do,” Garnette said. Once you have a few names, Masi suggests meeting with the doctors without your child. Go armed with a list of questions and get answers about their education, experience, expertise with children, and the specific issues or diagnoses affecting your child. “You should not feel uncomfortable interviewing a therapist,” Masi said. And think about the office atmosphere. Masi would have doubts about a doctor who claimed to specialize in children, but who had no toys or child-sized furniture in the waiting room. “Definitely look for an expertise in treating children,” Garnette said. “Children are not all little adults. A lot of it has to do with how you just click with a person because it’s so personal.”\nGarnette would also seek someone with a few years’ experience because “you do get better with practice.”\nLeman also recommends finding a therapist who wants to help the child, not finish the payments on his yacht. “Find someone who wants to get rid of you,” he said. “If they’re good, they want the child to be well and take off on his own.”\nHe would also check with the local mental health society or board for any misconduct cases against a professional you’re considering. Don’t expect to rely on one psychiatrist, psychologist or therapist alone. Many cases are best helped by a network of parents and professionals working together on different aspects of the child’s therapy. As a result, Masi suggests asking about affiliations when interviewing the initial professional. “If she’s not a psychiatrist, ask what psychiatrist she works with and if that person is a child psychiatrist,” Masi said. For many cases, experts recommend a comprehensive plan, taking in a few professionals. For example, a plan for a child showing severe attention problems in school might include talk therapy with a family therapist, participation in a social-skills group and drug management through a psychiatrist. “Ideally, you want a situation in which all those people talk to each other and that ‘s really difficult,” Garnette said. The situation is made more difficult by current practices in health management organizations and insurers that often have definite guidelines regarding length of treatment and the types of professional care covered. On average, Garnette says, managed-care companies will pay for 10 to 15 sessions, but it’s often fewer. In advocating for her son, she once threatened a vice president of her HMO with a lawsuit before the company agreed to extra care. “They want to cure everyone in four sessions and it’s just not possible,” Garnette said. And ask up front how long the therapist expects his or her work with your child to continue. Even a rough estimate can help you plan for expenses and the effect on the child and the family, Masi says. Traumatic situations don’t always allow for weeks of planning. However, some don’t require a therapist either, Leman says. In the case of a child grieving after a family member’s death, Leman encourages parents to “give themselves more credit.”\n“Why would a kid want to see a stranger if they’re grieving?” he asked. “Share your imperfect self with your child. It’s healthy for them to see you cry, pray, be concerned. That’s OK.”\nGarnette cautions parents to remain involved in the therapy process so they will see if changes are needed. Her son went through five psychiatrists before he found one that seemed a perfect match. “It’s worth it when you get there,” Garnette said. “Your gut feeling is often right.”\nGuinness, M.

Autism Spectrum Disorders are very complex, yet their features can be very subtle; they are not always obvious on the surface. As a result, an Aspergers (high-functioning autism) assessment will take more time than most other assessments. Below are the methods that clinicians who are new to the field of Aspergers can use as a guide. These are also the methods that moms and dads should look for to make sure they are getting a good assessment for their Aspergers child. An assessment should be conducted by a doctor, psychologist, or psychiatrist who has expertise in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). This is important because most degree programs may only give passing information about Aspergers. A clinician may have a lot of experience in evaluating and may know the DSM criteria for Aspergers – but knowing the criteria on paper is not the same as having the background to really know all of the subtle features to look for. If you are a clinician and do not have the background experience with Aspergers yet, consult with a clinician who does. If you are a mother or father getting an Aspergers assessment done, ask about the background experience of the clinician. Assess each of the core areas of difficulty along with the more subtle characteristics. Aspergers involves qualitative difficulties in language, social interactions, and more stereotyped and repetitive behaviors and interests; however, there cannot be a real delay in language – but it does often involve difficulties in how language is being used. It is not enough to question parents about language delays or social interactions or interests. A good assessment will look at how behaviors are being exhibited. Even if the Aspergers child is social, the clinician needs to look at whether he\/she can take other people's perspective:\n- Does he have imaginative play? - Does he demonstrate sensory preferences that interfere with required or socially desires activities? - Does he approach others and initiate interactions? - Can he talk about someone else' preferred topic? - Can he switch tasks when redirected fairly easily? - Can he listen as well as talk? These are just some of the more subtle behaviors that need to be observed in Aspergers kids who may be higher functioning. This goes beyond just asking, \"Does your son or daughter socialize?\" Use observation in a variety of settings as the core of the assessment. Behaviors can be exhibited for more than one reason. For example, escape, reactions to sensory processing difficulties, attention seeking, and seeking rewards can all be the basis for behaviors. A question on a form reveals that a behavior is being exhibited, but does not reveal why or exactly what the behavior looks like. The only way to know the \"why\" of many behaviors is to observe in natural settings and to spend time with the Aspergers youngster. It is not enough to simply observe the Aspergers child in a clinical setting. If clinicians take the child to an unfamiliar location and put her in a room with grown-ups that she has never seen before and then ask the parent to leave the room, you will not get a good picture of how this child interacts with others. If it is not possible to observe the child in a natural setting, then ask the parents if they can videotape their child during various activities. It is critical to observe the child – close up – in a small playgroup. Observing play and social interactions may look good from a distance; however, when the clinician can (a) hear everything that is being said, (b) follow the child’s eyes, (c) see how he responds to interruptions and so forth, then the clinician can really assess the details of those interactions and begin to interpret them as possibly on the spectrum or not. The clinician can also tell if the child’s play is “parallel play” or if it is really “cooperative play.” Observations not only support the diagnosis, but they are essential in order to give individualized, rather than generic, recommendations. Clinicians should pair observations with interviews, ratings scales and direct assessment. One rating scale alone should not be the actual assessment. However, rating scales should be given to support observations. If the results do match what is being observed, then check to make sure that the rating scales were completed correctly and ask the rater for examples of what was being rated high in the scales. For example, a behavior could be rated as being \"frequently\" observed.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:90620d8e-b921-4b03-91ee-e4fec94f5831>"]},{"passage":"They went on to say the program team is the practical place to support this discussion as the teams “sit down and do some brainstorming and SWOT analysis and stuff like that.” This member recommended more time to support these discussions would be beneficial. One challenge that may prevent specialist interaction with agents is that often work is done around district structures and meetings in which specialists are not always present. A member of the team said, “One of the challenges I’ve seen is sometimes we do things around district meetings and things like that. And then specialists don't necessarily know about them and don't really feel like that's something that they can easily plug into.” Some of the districts do host special planning meetings where they invite specialists. Another team member said,\nI know, like, for example, with our planning district meetings, we have one a year that if there's some things going on, or there's been a hot topic, we do this-usually late summer. If there's been something hot going on in the summer, we'll invite those specialists to give us a summary and we can talk about what we can do the next year. And this, that, and the other and, most of the AREC people. But, I wonder if we need to look at some of that on a different level. Another member of the team spoke about the variability within VCE and how this makes this situation more challenging. He said,\nWe have specialists, like you mentioned it, at an AREC, particularly in ag areas that are very client oriented - to the grower level. But then I know other specialists that are more, I guess I’d say higher level - that work with companies or work with topics - solar energy, or something like that and maybe then they're not so many individual people on the ground at a higher level. I know when community viability was around, [a specialist] worked a lot with whole counties, that whole region regional planning district. So that's the thing with Extension. We're not a one- size-fits-all kind of organization. So there probably are specialists that don't maybe work with 107 county agents - locality agents. That's just maybe not the nature of their work. But for the ones that do want to for sure I hope we can provide this opportunity. Both agents and specialists need to understand each other’s roles, another member of the team emphasized. Maybe it needs to come from both sides of what specialist see, maybe they can see what agents do maybe merge that information together somewhere that's kind of like relevant with the new technology age. We don't know what each other does sometimes and how we can actually benefit from each other, so I’m not sure how to make that connection work. Interactions occur, but don’t always support the types of discussions that need to take place to move VCE forward. Being able to do this would “expand the horizons” of the organization. A team member said,\nBut how can we, as an organization, connect the agents in the specialists in. And I know we do a lot of things, but how could we do it in a manner to where we can discuss some of these. The things like the situation analysis. Usually, when we're connecting we're connecting in a field day, over special project or connecting at a 4-H function - understand what I’m saying? But how can we connect and with more than just our little net, our little group, how can we expand that I guess, for everybody. How would that? What would what would be a means to be able to do that to expand our horizons I guess. Another agent on the team said they have a group of specialists they work with regularly. But, she asked, “How do we get outside our comfort zone and engage with other specialist? And how do we get specialist out of their comfort zone and engage with some of the agents, maybe they don’t know?” Program teams provide “camaraderie” but there may be other relationships outside the program teams that could be beneficial. A member of the team talked about a specialists fair that was held in the past as part of winter in-service. She said,\nI think it's been four or five years ago the departments went and set out posters, and then the agents could visit. And that was supposed to kind of help. But, there weren't a lot of agents that came to chat about what was going on in programs. But then again that might be the comfort question. But the other thing I wonder, also in that scenario your kind of setting it up where it's the agents coming to find the specialist.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:07354379-c2f3-4fd6-bbea-8a4a2e53940b>"]},{"passage":"Seven Simple Steps for Successful End-of-the-Year Assessment\nWith this guide, you'll create an assessment that leaves you organized and prepared to add and modify for next year. - Grades: PreK–K, 1–2, 3–5\nLate spring is a good time to begin thinking ahead to next year. A comprehensive process of program and individual assessment can take up to six weeks. Starting early will allow plenty of time to plan and discuss all the components and strategize goals. As you begin this process, start with a comprehensive assessment and evaluation of the year as a whole. The process of program assessment has several components. A comprehensive end-of the-year assessment should include all the individuals and groups who are involved, such as program administrators, education coordinators, teachers, parents, and children. Don't forget the children! Their opinions may surprise and delight you. Reflecting on the work of this year will allow you to set goals that will strengthen your program in the coming year. Consider these seven steps, ideas, and resources. Start now. Experienced early childhood professionals know the end of the year is ab time. Unexpected events can require attention that may take your mind off this important process. Starting two months ahead will give you time to be thorough and detailed (and get temporarily distracted!). Plan carefully. Think about what you want to know. Ask for feedback and input from all stakeholders, plan the strategies and questions, and then execute your plan. Keep in mind that when you ask a question can influence the responses you get. Start the process when other deadlines or priorities will not conflict and allow several days for people to get involved and for comments to filter in. Vary the method. Written surveys are only one way of getting information. Try personal gatherings around some simple refreshments at the end of the day, use a few minutes in another meeting to ask a couple of questions, post a question on a chart in the hallway and attach a pen or marker, and engage in informal one-on-one discussions. Make sure to document ideas that come from these conversations quickly so they are not lost. Delegate. Ask for help coordinating the information gathering. Parents could communicate and compile their groups' responses. One or two teachers could work to gather information from teachers and staff. An older group of school-age children could assist in getting responses from preschool children. Request that a member of each group summarize the information gathered and list the recommendations. Set goals. Discuss responses with each group. Identify goals for next year by area of the program or curriculum. What additions are needed to the curriculum? What strategies can be used to improve staff development? How can we enhance the education, the services, or the program for teachers and parents? What are children interested in learning about? What community programs or initiatives could be integrated into your curriculum and program next year? Create an action plan. Here's where everyone gets involved to agree on specific strategies that will be the focus for next year. A frequent problem with this stage of assessment occurs when the action plan has too many strategies. Keep the plan simple and specific. Try starting with no more than two strategies for each area. When those are accomplished, add more. What new curriculum ideas will be added? List by classroom so that each teacher is focused on a few specific goals. Will new equipment or materials be purchased? Share the vision. Gather everyone together. Share the successes and accomplishments made over the past year. The goals and strategies you have established for the coming year are your vision for the future. This can be done in many different and fun ways. Teachers can share personal growth, children can share projects from the year, and everyone can enjoy a picnic or potluck meal. As you all work together to assess your accomplishments this year, you will be organized and prepared to add and modify for next year. This process, done yearly, will be a productive and positive experience for everyone involved. Seeing the positive changes and growth take place from one year to the next in the curriculum, program, and for teachers and parents is one of the most rewarding parts of working in early childhood education.

In my school career, I had 3 different cases of self-harming and I was working mainly in the mainstream primary setting\nYou will need the support of your organisation as you cannot act in isolation. Look after yourself – it is hard to support someone if you are feeling overwhelmed. Make sure you also have a source of support for yourself. It is fine, to be honest about your own fears. Staff who have contact with children\/young people who self-harm in their setting should be provided with appropriate training to understand but also to offer support. Educational staff can work around children coping skills, self-esteem, self-care, resiliency, and teaching them to problem solve as well as encouraging children and young people to seek individual therapy. Assessment of Needs should be offered to all people who have self-harmed and the risk assessment of further self-harm and\/or suicide should be identified. Ok. There you have it! I hope that you enjoyed this video and the quiz today and I’m looking forward to hearing from you. After you’ve finished, please join the discussion below.

As the game progressed it was clear to see that one goal would be the difference as the game was played mostly in the midfield region, as the game reached its final stages both teams began to push for a winner and this left gaps all over the field and when Kilnhurst were awarded a corner they took it short and the ball was played to midfielder Brandon Walker who hit a thunderous first time strike which gave the Anston goalkeeper no chance. With only a minute to play Anston restarted the game and immediately pushed to find the goal which would take the match to penalties, but the Kilnhurst defence stood strong and limited them to one deflected effort which almost caught out the Kilnhurst Goalkeeper but he recovered well and tipped the ball over the crossbar. This proved to be the last action of the game as the final whistle went and Kilnhurst progress through to the quarter finals. We would like to say well done to both teams for the way they conducted themselves at the match and whilst on the pitch playing.\n\nThe match between Manchester United and Chelsea. The game was quite successful for the Red devils, and despite the fact the score was 1:0, the fans of the Chelsea were very happy with it. 2. The meeting between Manchester City and Liverpool. The teams played quite well, and Liverpool managed to score a goal in the last minute. 3. The confrontation between Tottenham and Arsenal. The Gunners managed to take the lead in the first half, but Tottenham managed to equalize the score in the second half. About the author\nYour email address will not be published.

In November of 1713 a turning point was reached in Pope's fortunes. He issued proposals for the publication, by subscription, of a translation of Homer's \"Iliad\" into English verse, with notes. The matter was warmly taken up, and subscriptions poured in apace. His friends stood by him, Swift in particular obtaining a long list of influential patrons. Work was at once begun on the undertaking, and the first four books appeared in 1715, the remaining volumes coming out at intervals in 1716, 1717, 1718, and 1720, when the task was completed. Three years later he undertook the translation of the \"Odyssey\", which, with the aid of Broome and Fenton as collaborators, he completed by 1726. Pope's exact share was twelve books; the rest were by his assistants. By Homer Pope made close on £2000, which, added to what his father had left him, placed him in a position of independence for the remainder of his life. While engaged on his great translation Pope found time for other forms of literary work, and in 1717 he published two of the very best of his lyrics, namely, the \"Elegy to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady\" and the \"Epistle of Eloïsa to Abelard\", and he joined with Gay and Arbuthnot in writing and producing the unsuccessful farce \"Three Hours after Marriage\". He also undertook for Tonson, the publisher, an annotated edition of Shakespeare, which appeared in 1725, a task for which Pope's powers were unequal, for he was not sufficiently versed in the literature of the Elizabethan and Jacobean period, and although the preface is very fine and many shrewd emendations were made in the text, Pope's Shakespeare was on the whole far from being a success. It was at once attacked by Theobald, who thus exposed himself to the characteristic vengeance which Pope was shortly to take by making him the first hero of the \"Dunciad\". In 1713-14 Pope, with Swift, Arbuthnot, and other leaders of the Tory Party, had formed a sort of literary society called the Scriblerus Club, and had amused themselves by burlesquing the vagaries of literature in the \"Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus\", which, although included in the edition of Pope's prose works in 1741, was mainly the composition of Arbuthnot. Arising partly out of the performance of \"Scriblerus\", Pope and Swift published in 1727-28 three volumes of their \"Miscellanies\", which contained among other things Pope's \"Treatise on the Bathos, or the Art of Sinking in Poetry\", illustrated by examples from the inferior poets of the day. These \"Miscellanies\", and particularly the \"Bathos\", drew down upon the authors a torrent of abuse from every quill-driver and poetaster who had been in reality attacked or fancied himself ridiculed. The \"Dunciad\" was in turn the outcome of these invectives. This celebrated satire first appeared, in three books, in May, 1728, and an enlarged edition followed in 1729. In 1742 a further issue appeared with the addition of a fourth book, and in 1743 the poem came out in its final form with Theobald dethroned and Colley Cibber installed in his room as King of the Dunces. The publication of this swinging satire naturally increased the fury against Pope, who was roundly abused in all the moods and tenses. Nor did he shrink from the fray. He gave back blow for blow for eight years, 1730-37, in a weekly sheet, the \"Grub Street Journal\", as well as paying off old scores when opportunity offered in his avowed and more ambitious publications.\n\nFrom 1598 he published his translation of the Iliad in installments. In 1616 the complete Iliad and Odyssey appeared in The Whole Works of Homer, the first complete English translation, which until Pope's was the most popular in the English language and was the way most English speakers encountered these poems. The endeavour was to have been profitable: his patron, Prince Henry, had promised him £300 on its completion plus a pension. However, Henry died in 1612 and his household neglected the commitment, leaving Chapman without either a patron or an income.

Chapman's translation of the Odyssey is written in iambic pentameter, whereas his Iliad is written in iambic heptameter. (The Greek original is in dactylic hexameter.) Chapman often extends and elaborates on Homer's original contents to add descriptive detail or moral and philosophical interpretation and emphasis. Chapman's translation of Homer was much admired by John Keats, notably in his famous poem On First Looking into Chapman's Homer, and also drew attention from Samuel Taylor Coleridge and T. S. Eliot.

Usually considered to have been written down circa the 8th century BC, the Iliad is among the oldest extant works of Western literature, along with the Odyssey, another epic poem attributed to Homer which tells of Odysseus’s experiences after the events of the Iliad. Is the Iliad older than the Bible? No. The Iliad and Odyssey predate the Bible by several hundred years. Was the Iliad written before the Odyssey? The Iliad is the earlier work (it was written first) . Also the events in the Odyssey are a direct consequence of what happens in the Iliad and the reader of the Odyssey is assumed to know the summary of the plot in the Iliad and who the main characters are. Why did Homer write Iliad? Homer probably wished he could have witnessed the events of the Trojan War, but the actual battle dates more than 400 years before there was ever any mention of the poet Homer. Who Killed Achilles?

Achilles was said to have died from a heel wound as the result of a poisoned arrow shot by Paris, Hector’s brother (see Figure 2). Is the Iliad true?

The “Iliad” tells the story of the Trojan War — if there was such a war — with Greeks battling Trojans. Is the Iliad The oldest book? The Epic of Gilgamesh is the oldest known piece of literature in the world. Written in 2100 BCE it predates Homer’s Iliad by 1500 years.

Is the Iliad hard to read? For the first-time reader, probably the hardest thing about Homer’s Iliad is its language. And once you get past the weird cultural details (reading the introduction to your edition will help), the poem is extremely accessible. The characters are vivid, and every reader will find someone to identify with. Is the Iliad a good read? It’s battle scenes are majestic, yet heartbreaking in it’s understanding of human tragedy, life and fate. It’s a beautifully deep work, it’s timeless and there is so much that can be learnt from it. Originally Answered: Is The Iliad worth reading? Yes, definitely. Is Troy based on a true story? No, ‘Troy‘ is not based on a true story. However, the film is based on the epic poem ‘The Iliad.

Homer (\/ˈhoʊmər\/; Ancient Greek: Ὅμηρος Greek pronunciation: [hómɛːros], Hómēros; c. 800– c. 701 BC) was the presumed author of the Iliad and the Odyssey, two epic poems that are the foundational works of ancient Greek literature.\n\nThe IliadeBook - 2014\nThe Iliad is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma, for which Barry Powell, one of the twenty-first century's leading Homeric scholars, has given us a magnificent new translation. Graceful, lucid, and energetic, Powell's translation renders the Homeric Greek with a simplicity and dignity reminiscent of the original. The text immediately engrosses students with its tight and balanced rhythms, while the incantatory repetitions evoke a continuous \"stream of sound\" that offers as good an impression of Homer's Greek as one could hope to attain without learning the language. Accessible, poetic, and accurate, Powell's translation is an excellent fit for today's students. With swift, transparent language that rings both ancient and modern, it exposes them to all of the rage, pleasure, pathos, and humor that are Homer's Iliad.

Just as Homer's work existed most fully in its performance, so the Homeric texts call periodically for new translations. With this in mind, Fagles offers a new verse rendering of the Iliad. Maneuvering between the literal and the literary, he tries with varying degrees of success to suggest the vigor and manner of the original while producing readable poetry in English. Thus, he avoids the anachronizing of Robert Fitzgerald's translation, while being more literal than Richard Lattimore's. Fagles's efforts are accompanied by a long and penetrating introduction by Bernard Knox, coupled with detailed glossary and textual notes.-- T.L. Cooksey, Armstrong State Coll., Savannah, Ga.

In November of 1713 a turning point was reached in Pope's fortunes. He issued proposals for the publication, by subscription, of a translation of Homer's \"Iliad\" into English verse, with notes. The matter was warmly taken up, and subscriptions poured in apace. His friends stood by him, Swift in particular obtaining a long list of influential patrons. Work was at once begun on the undertaking, and the first four books appeared in 1715, the remaining volumes coming out at intervals in 1716, 1717, 1718, and 1720, when the task was completed. Three years later he undertook the translation of the \"Odyssey\", which, with the aid of Broome and Fenton as collaborators, he completed by 1726. Pope's exact share was twelve books; the rest were by his assistants. By Homer Pope made close on £2000, which, added to what his father had left him, placed him in a position of independence for the remainder of his life. While engaged on his great translation Pope found time for other forms of literary work, and in 1717 he published two of the very best of his lyrics, namely, the \"Elegy to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady\" and the \"Epistle of Eloïsa to Abelard\", and he joined with Gay and Arbuthnot in writing and producing the unsuccessful farce \"Three Hours after Marriage\". He also undertook for Tonson, the publisher, an annotated edition of Shakespeare, which appeared in 1725, a task for which Pope's powers were unequal, for he was not sufficiently versed in the literature of the Elizabethan and Jacobean period, and although the preface is very fine and many shrewd emendations were made in the text, Pope's Shakespeare was on the whole far from being a success. It was at once attacked by Theobald, who thus exposed himself to the characteristic vengeance which Pope was shortly to take by making him the first hero of the \"Dunciad\". In 1713-14 Pope, with Swift, Arbuthnot, and other leaders of the Tory Party, had formed a sort of literary society called the Scriblerus Club, and had amused themselves by burlesquing the vagaries of literature in the \"Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus\", which, although included in the edition of Pope's prose works in 1741, was mainly the composition of Arbuthnot.

Usually considered to have been written down circa the 8th century BC, the Iliad is among the oldest extant works of Western literature, along with the Odyssey, another epic poem attributed to Homer which tells of Odysseus’s experiences after the events of the Iliad. Is the Iliad older than the Bible? No. The Iliad and Odyssey predate the Bible by several hundred years. Was the Iliad written before the Odyssey? The Iliad is the earlier work (it was written first) . Also the events in the Odyssey are a direct consequence of what happens in the Iliad and the reader of the Odyssey is assumed to know the summary of the plot in the Iliad and who the main characters are. Why did Homer write Iliad? Homer probably wished he could have witnessed the events of the Trojan War, but the actual battle dates more than 400 years before there was ever any mention of the poet Homer. Who Killed Achilles? The story of Achilles is one of the most important legends in Greek mythology. Achilles was said to have died from a heel wound as the result of a poisoned arrow shot by Paris, Hector’s brother (see Figure 2). Is the Iliad true? As the historical sources – Herodotus and Eratosthenes – show, it was generally assumed to have been a real event. According to Homer’s Iliad, the conflict between the Greeks – led by Agamemnon, King of Mycenae – and the Trojans – whose king was Priam – took place in the Late Bronze Age, and lasted 10 years. How old is the Iliad now? The text is Homer’s “Iliad,” and Homer — if there was such a person — probably wrote it in 762 B.C., give or take 50 years, the researchers found. The “Iliad” tells the story of the Trojan War — if there was such a war — with Greeks battling Trojans. Is the Iliad The oldest book? The Epic of Gilgamesh is the oldest known piece of literature in the world. Written in 2100 BCE it predates Homer’s Iliad by 1500 years. What does the word Iliad mean? 1a: a series of miseries or disastrous events. b: a series of exploits regarded as suitable for an epic. 2: a long narrative especially: an epic in the Homeric tradition. Is the Iliad hard to read? For the first-time reader, probably the hardest thing about Homer’s Iliad is its language. And once you get past the weird cultural details (reading the introduction to your edition will help), the poem is extremely accessible. The characters are vivid, and every reader will find someone to identify with. Is the Iliad a good read? It’s battle scenes are majestic, yet heartbreaking in it’s understanding of human tragedy, life and fate. It’s a beautifully deep work, it’s timeless and there is so much that can be learnt from it. Originally Answered: Is The Iliad worth reading? Yes, definitely. Is Troy based on a true story? No, ‘Troy‘ is not based on a true story. However, the film is based on the epic poem ‘The Iliad. What is the moral lesson of the Iliad? The Iliad, the story of the Trojan War, offers several moral lessons to its readers, including the importance of leaders treating their soldiers with respect, the importance of accepting apologies, and the need for respecting family bonds.

Nashville has recorded 7.59 inches of rain in February through Tuesday, 4.79 inches above normal for the same time period according to National Weather Service meteorologist Faith Borden. The next several days could bring 2-3 inches of additional rain through Saturday for most of the region and possibly more in isolated areas, Borden said. Northwestern portions of Middle Tennessee may get the higher totals that could range from 3 to 5 inches of rain through Saturday. Slightly lesser amounts of rainfall are expected along the Cumberland Plateau with 1-2 inches forecast, according to the National Weather Service. A flood watch is in effect for multiple counties in the region that include Davidson, Sumner and Williamson, which Borden said could be extended.

But in exercising the sensors of those test probes, we made the remarkable discovery that there is water in the Cumberland! At first, we were sure that it had to be a faulty reading or a broken instrument, but seven different tests on multiple instruments confirmed the finding!”\nNASA scientists revealed that their findings indicate that the Cumberland River’s elemental make-up contains a staggering 14% water content. The rest, they say, is a mix of spilled beer from Dancin’ In the District concerts in the 1990s, misplaced Red Bulls from various marathons and 5Ks, discarded flyers from your neighbor’s set at Tin Roof, an as-yet-unclassified semi-gaseous element which they are currently calling “Nashvillium”, and the tears of frustrated Titan’s fans. The science team claim they have been withholding their findings for several years until now, so as not to tip off the public that seeking water was an objective of their search on Mars.

What Can Trees Do For Nashville? Nashville’s impervious surfaces have increased by 20% over the past 2 decades in urban areas at a cost in excess of $100 billion nationally. Local governments are increasingly looking toward non-built storm water management strategies, including trees to reduce the cost of constructing storm water control infrastructure. Some of the intercepted water evaporates back into the atmosphere, and some soaks into the ground reducing the total amount of runoff that must be managed in urban areas. Trees also slow storm flow, reducing the volume of water that a containment facility must store. For example, in the Metropolitan Washington DC region, the existing 46 % tree canopy reduces the need for retention structures by 949 million cubic feet, valued at $4.7 billion per 20-year construction cycle (based on a $5\/cubic foot construction cost). What can I Do For Nashville's Urban Canopy? · Help Nashville get more roots in the ground!

OUR COMMITMENT TO RESTORING NASHVILLE’S URBAN CANOPY\nTrees are a remarkably effective and low-cost solution to water pollution, so we are working with the Nashville Tree Foundation, the Tennessee Environmental Council, several Metro Nashville Departments, and a conglomerate other citizen groups to collectively restore Nashville’s tree canopy. The plan is to plant 500,000 trees between now and 2050, and we have committed to being responsible for at least 10,000 trees between 2016 and 2021. So far, we have planted approximately 6,000 trees and we plan to meet (and possibly exceed) our target of ten thousand before 2021! URBAN CANOPY MAINTENANCE PROGRAM\nThe restoration of our urban canopy is dependent upon regular watering of newly planted trees—especially during the first two summers. A recent survey of park trees planted in 2015 and 2016 showed a 60% survival rate; which indicates that newly planted trees with no maintenance plan in place are at a higher risk of fatality. So, we decided to start a program to do just that! We officially launched the long-awaited Urban Canopy Maintenance Program in December of 2017! This program was established to help care for young trees all over Nashville, and anyone can enroll their trees. Each maintenance package includes one year of watering, pruning, and data collection–and for every paid maintenance package, we are donating a year of maintenance to a tree in the area with greater impermeable surface area, lower canopy coverage, higher average surface temperatures, or socioeconomic disadvantage. There are thousands of trees planted every year in Nashville, and they need a lot of water in their first few years of life to establish a healthy root system. Unfortunately, they often don’t receive the care they require to flourish or even survive. The goal of the Urban Canopy Maintenance Program is to increase their survival rate so that Nashville can continue to restore and expand its urban canopy. PROGRAM FEES & BENEFITS\nFor each paid maintenance package, the Cumberland River Compact will donate one year of maintenance to a tree in need. $90\/year per tree includes:\n- Regular watering\n- Pruning of suckers and shoots\n- Data collection & reporting\nSee if you qualify for\nThe Compact’s Tree Water Maintenance Program! Email Heather Listermann\nwith the following info:\nNumber of Trees\nTree Age (Approx)\nTREE CARE TIPS\nHOW OFTEN DO I NEED TO WATER MY TREE? Young trees need approximately one inch of water per week. During dry times it is important to water your tree at least once a week, sometimes even twice. Always water the tree slowly so the water has time to soak into the soil.\n\nService Estimates Economic Impact of Critical Habitat Designation for Fluted Kidneyshell and Slabside Pearlymussel\nApril 26, 2013\n- Stephanie Chance, 931\/528-6481, ext. 211, email@example.com\n- Tom MacKenzie, 404\/679-7291 firstname.lastname@example.org\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announces the availability of a draft economic analysis considering the impact of a proposal to designate critical habitat for two freshwater mussels proposed for listing as endangered. If the two species are listed, and if critical habitat is finalized as it is proposed, the draft economic analysis suggests a range of economic impacts that are possible as a result. In addition to opening a public comment period on the draft economic analysis, the Service is re-opening a public comment period on the proposal to designate critical habitat for these mussels under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) for 30 days by May 29, 2013, in order to allow comments on the draft analysis and the proposed critical habitat designation. The Service first released the proposed critical habitat designation for public comment in October 2012. The fluted kidneyshell and the slabside pearlymussel are only found in portions of the Cumberland and Tennessee River systems of Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia. They have both been eliminated from more than 60 percent of the total number of streams where they historically lived. Only a handful of populations of both species are considered biologically viable. The primary reasons for these mussels’ decline include impoundments, mining, oil and gas exploration, sedimentation, chemical contaminants, temperature alterations, recurring drought and flooding, population fragmentation and isolation, loss of fish hosts, and the introduced, invasive Asian clam. The economic analysis estimates the total incremental cost of critical habitat designation to be up to $3.5 million over 20 years. These costs stem from the requirement for federal agencies to consult with the Service regarding the impacts of their actions, or those that they fund or authorize, on critical habitat. Other sectors of the economy likely to be subject to the impacts include commercial, industrial, residential, utility development, agricultural, and recreational development. The majorities of these costs are administrative and may be borne by federal and state agencies; however, some costs may be incurred by local governments and businesses if federal funding or a federal permit is involved. Critical habitat is a term defined in the ESA. It refers to specific geographic areas that are essential to the conservation of a threatened or endangered species and which may require special management considerations or protection. The designation of critical habitat on private land has no impact on private landowner activities that do not require federal funding or permits. In total, the Service is proposing 27 critical habitat units encompassing 1,380 miles (2,218 km) in Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia for the fluted kidneyshell and slabside pearlymussel. Some of the units overlap and are proposed critical habitat for both species. Here are the proposed critical habitat designations for each mussel. For the fluted kidneyshell, the Service is proposing 24 critical habitat units encompassing 1,182 miles (1,899 km) of stream channel in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia. For the slabside pearlymussel, thirteen critical habitat units encompassing 971 miles (1,562 km) of stream channel in Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia are proposed for the slabside pearlymussel. The fluted kidneyshell’s proposed designation includes eight streams of unoccupied habitat. There are no unoccupied streams designated for the slabside pearlymussel. All streams proposed as critical habitat are occupied by one of these species, or by another previously listed mussel species. Unoccupied habitats provide additional habitat for population expansion and promote genetic diversity, which will decrease the risk of extinction for these two species. For example, the Elk, Holston, and French Broad rivers are being proposed as unoccupied critical habitat for the fluted kidneyshell. This species was once found in these areas.\n\nEnvironmental Information and Assessment of Environmental Impacts\nThe National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to evaluate the potential effects of their activities and programs on the quality of the human environment.

The calculation of the average value is then\nand is evaluated to equal 1807.17 and the units are ft3\/min based on the units of the constant (ft2) multiplied by the units of the equation (ft\/min). c) The scientist proposes the function f, given by f(x) = as a model for the depth of the water, in feet, at Picnic Point x feet from the river’s edge. Find the area of the cross-section of the river at Picnic Point based on this model. The area of the cross section can be calculated by integrating the given equation from the starting value to the ending value. The general equation for integration is\nwhere a is the starting point, b is the ending point, and the f(x) is the given equation. Within the context of the problem, the starting point would be 0 and the ending point would be 24 as that is the total width of the river, and equation would be the above given equation. Using the equation and the given data, the cross sectional area can be found to be 122.23 ft2. d) Recall that the volumetric flow is the product of the cross sectional area and the velocity of the water at a location. To prevent flooding, water must be diverted if the average value of the volumetric flow at Picnic Point exceeds 2100 cubic feet per minute for a 20-minute period. Using your answer from part c), find the average value of the volumetric flow during the time interval 40 ≤ t ≤ 60 minutes. Does the value indicate that the water must be diverted? The average value of the volumetric flow can be calculated using the same formula as above\nbut this time using the values of 40 minutes for a, 60 minutes for b, 122.23 ft2 as the constant, and the same velocity equation, v(t) = 16+2sin(√(x+10)), the average value of the volumetric flow is 2181.89 ft3\/min. Therefore, the flow would have to be diverted away from that part of the river. 2. There are 700 people in line for a popular amusement-park ride when the ride begins operation in the morning. Once it begins operation, the ride accepts passengers until the park closes 8 hours later. While there is a line, people move onto the ride at a rate of 800 people per hour. The graph below shows the rate, r(t), at which people arrive at the ride throughout the day. Time t is measured in hours from the time the ride begins operation. How many people arrive at the ride between t = 0 and t = 3? Show the computations. The number of riders who arrived at the ride between t=0 and t=3 can be calculated using the trapezoidal rule and the graph below. This can be done because the area under the curve on the given interval corresponds to the number of riders who arrived in that time frame. Two trapezoids can be made on the given interval, one from t=0 to t=2 and the second on the interval t=2 to t=3. For the first trapezoid, the heights are 1000 and 1200, and the width is 2 so the area is 2200, and for the second trapezoid the heights are 1200 and 800, with a width of 1 so the area is 1000. Therefore, the resulting total area under the curve and number of passengers who arrived at the ride between t=0 and t=3 was 3200 passengers. Is the number of people waiting in line to get on the ride increasing or decreasing between t = 2 and t = 3? Justify. The number of people waiting to get on the ride is increasing between t=2 and t=3 because the rate at which passengers get onto the ride is 800 passengers per hour and while the rate at which passengers arrive at the ride is decreasing between t=2 and t=3, it is still larger than 800 passengers an hour. At what time (t) is the line for the ride the longest? How many people are in line at that time? Justify.\n\nUsing the CyArk Hazard map (linked above), locate the city of New Orleans, Louisiana. The city of New Orleans is a US city with a long history. One of the oldest cities in the US, New Orleans has become known as a cultural melting pot with a unique culture and cuisine. New Orleans is home to a rich culture, famous for their festivals, such as Mardi Gras, and is also known as the birthplace of jazz. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused considerable damage to the city of New Orleans. Many of the city's levees broke which caused water levels to rise, leaving much of the city underwater. In the events of global warming, New Orleans faces the danger of becoming submerged under the waters of the Gulf of Mexico once again. Zoom in on the city of New Orleans to zoom level 7. Have students locate New Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico. 2. On the Hazard Map, adjust the the sea levels from 0 meters to 1 meter. How is the city affected? At 5 meters sea level rise? 10 meters sea level rise? 20 meters? 3. Explain to students that if the sea levels of the world rise, the water will first flood the parts of the city with the lowest elevation. Elevation is the height of the land above the level of the sea. Rising sea levels would first affect coastal areas with low elevation. Extension for advanced students and high grade levels:\n4. Here is a map of New Orlean's elevations\nHow do the areas on this map correspond to the flooded areas in the CyArk Hazard Map? How does elevation play a role in sea level rise? How will melting glacial ice from Antarctica and Greenland affect sea levels? Find the list of materials above. Choose one of two methods below:\n1. Fill ziplock bags with water. 2. Place ziplock bags flat in the freezer and let freeze. 3. When the water has completely frozen into ice, remove the ice from the ziplock bag. You should now have a small, flat sheet of ice. 1. Using ice cubes, place about 6 ice cubes in a small container or ziplock bag. 2. Wet the ice cubes slightly and then place in the freezer. 3. Remove the ice cubes after they have frozen together to form a block of several ice cubes stuck together. 1. Fill a small plastic container with rocks or gravel. Alternatively, a small, unopened can (such as a tuna can) be be used. The container of choice should be relatively heavy to prevent the container from floating in water. This container will represent a continent or island. Place the weighted container in a large shallow pan. 2. Using sugar cubes and glue, have students construct a small city on top of the \"island.\" 3. Place another weighed container or can in the shallow pan. Place a large block of ice on top of the the weighed container. This will represent Antarctica and its thick layer of ice. 4. Using a pitcher, slowly fill the pan with water. Fill the container until the the water level reaches the top of the small container \"islands.\" Be careful not to splash water on the sugar cubes. 5. Measure the height of the water level in the pan with a ruler. Students should record the water level in their notebooks and record any observations about their sugar cube city. At this time students will write their predictions and hypothesis of what will happen as the ice cubes melt and what effect it will have on the sugar cube city. Optional: have students record their sugar cube city with a digital camera. 6. Direct the lamp towards the ice cubes in the container. The lamp represent solar activity and melts the ice cubes at a faster rate. 7. Once the sugar cubes have melted, students should measure the new water level with a ruler and record this number in their notebooks. Students should also record their observations on the sugar cube city. What happened to the city after the ice cubes melted? Did the level of the water rise? If so, by how much? Optional: have students photograph the sugar cube city after the ice melted. IV. Global Warming's Impact\nUsing the CyArk Hazard map (linked above) have students explore a local coastal town. Change the rise in sea levels to see how different parts of the city would be affected. Have students think of a recent trip to this city. How would your trip be different if the sea levels rose? What parts of the city would be different? What would be the same?\n\nThe consequences of the actual amount of warming that we expect to experience are horrifying, and are likely to include 80 to 250 feet of sea level rise and a dust bowl from Kansas to California\nMr. Romm next provides a litany of very bad things that he predicts are likely to occur if we do not implement a set of policies to aggressively restrict emissions. Consider Mr. Romm’s first prediction:\n- Sea level rise of 80 feet to 250 feet at a rate of 6 inches a decade (or more). A 250 foot rise in sea level would be very, very bad. It conjures up the image of massive tidal waves consuming major coastal cities. But this forecast is problematic for at least a couple of reasons. First, I don’t understand its internal logic. At 6 inches per decade, it would take 1,600 years to get to 80 feet, and 5,000 years to get to 250 feet. I assume we are not trying to consider effects in the years 3600 AD to 7000 AD. Second, while Mr. Romm doesn’t provide attribution for this forecast, it isn’t anything like any formal prediction I’ve ever seen from the IPCC. The IPCC is appropriately reserved about making predictions for sea level rise. They don’t provide best estimates by scenario, but just broad ranges. They also caution that the high end of any range is not an absolute maximum. The spread of IPCC projections for sea level rise through about 2100 across all six marker scenarios ranges from a low of 0.18 meters to a high of 0.59 meters. (See WG1 SPM, Table SPM.3) Crudely, these average about 0.4 meters, or about 15 inches total by about 2100. That’s quite a ways from 80 to 250 feet. Consider Mr. Romm’s second prediction:\nMr. Romm links to a blog post about a news report about a single climate simulation model study to support this. (Read the comments section on the page to which Mr. Romm links). The IPCC certainly does make predictions that large amounts of land, especially in Latin America (See WG2 Chapter 13, pages 583 and 597) and some other equatorial areas, will be subject to “desertification processes,” and this would be a serious problem, but I have not seen a claim as dramatic as Mr. Romm’s proceed from the IPCC process. Consider this in the context of Mr. Romm’s closely related prediction, also based on a blog citation of another single study using climate simulation models, for aridity impacts for the U.S.:\n…”a permanent drought by 2050 throughout the Southwest” – levels of aridity comparable to the 1930s Dust Bowl would stretch from Kansas to California. And they were only looking at a 720 ppm case! This is a pretty bleak picture of what, for example, the U.S. will look like: a 21st century army of Joads escaping an interior apocalypse, only to arrive at the coasts to find the cities flooded under hundreds of feet of water. In contrast, here is the complete list of “examples of projected impacts” that the IPCC provides to illustrate the effects of climate change for the continent of North America (See Synthesis Report, Summary for Policymakers, page 11):\n- Warming in western mountains is projected to cause decreased snowpack, more winter flooding and reduced summer flows, exacerbating competition for over-allocated water resources. - In the early decades of the century, moderate climate change is projected to increase aggregate yields of rain-fed agriculture by 5 to 20%, but with important variability among regions. Major challenges are projected for crops that are near the warm end of their suitable range or which depend on highly utilized water resources. - Cities that currently experience heat waves are expected to be further challenged by an increased number, intensity and duration of heat waves during the course of the century, with potential for adverse health impacts. - Coastal communities and habitats will be increasingly stressed by climate change impacts interacting with development and pollution. While serious, this doesn’t sound quite so dramatic. And so on with various other of Mr. Romm’s predictions. The negative consequences of a several degree increase in global temperatures would almost certainly be quite significant. In addition, these consequences would likely be felt disproportionately by poor people in developing countries, especially those near the equator. Exaggerating these effects, however, is not helpful.","passages":[{"passage":"Nashville weather: Sunny skies finally here on Sunday, but river flood threat remains into next week\nCarmen Klapper had barely any warning before a flash flood hit the RV park her family was staying in Saturday evening.

What Can Trees Do For Nashville? Nashville’s impervious surfaces have increased by 20% over the past 2 decades in urban areas at a cost in excess of $100 billion nationally. Local governments are increasingly looking toward non-built storm water management strategies, including trees to reduce the cost of constructing storm water control infrastructure. Some of the intercepted water evaporates back into the atmosphere, and some soaks into the ground reducing the total amount of runoff that must be managed in urban areas. Trees also slow storm flow, reducing the volume of water that a containment facility must store. For example, in the Metropolitan Washington DC region, the existing 46 % tree canopy reduces the need for retention structures by 949 million cubic feet, valued at $4.7 billion per 20-year construction cycle (based on a $5\/cubic foot construction cost).

OUR COMMITMENT TO RESTORING NASHVILLE’S URBAN CANOPY\nTrees are a remarkably effective and low-cost solution to water pollution, so we are working with the Nashville Tree Foundation, the Tennessee Environmental Council, several Metro Nashville Departments, and a conglomerate other citizen groups to collectively restore Nashville’s tree canopy. The plan is to plant 500,000 trees between now and 2050, and we have committed to being responsible for at least 10,000 trees between 2016 and 2021. So far, we have planted approximately 6,000 trees and we plan to meet (and possibly exceed) our target of ten thousand before 2021! URBAN CANOPY MAINTENANCE PROGRAM\nThe restoration of our urban canopy is dependent upon regular watering of newly planted trees—especially during the first two summers. A recent survey of park trees planted in 2015 and 2016 showed a 60% survival rate; which indicates that newly planted trees with no maintenance plan in place are at a higher risk of fatality. So, we decided to start a program to do just that! We officially launched the long-awaited Urban Canopy Maintenance Program in December of 2017! This program was established to help care for young trees all over Nashville, and anyone can enroll their trees. Each maintenance package includes one year of watering, pruning, and data collection–and for every paid maintenance package, we are donating a year of maintenance to a tree in the area with greater impermeable surface area, lower canopy coverage, higher average surface temperatures, or socioeconomic disadvantage. There are thousands of trees planted every year in Nashville, and they need a lot of water in their first few years of life to establish a healthy root system. Unfortunately, they often don’t receive the care they require to flourish or even survive. The goal of the Urban Canopy Maintenance Program is to increase their survival rate so that Nashville can continue to restore and expand its urban canopy. PROGRAM FEES & BENEFITS\nFor each paid maintenance package, the Cumberland River Compact will donate one year of maintenance to a tree in need. $90\/year per tree includes:\n- Regular watering\n- Pruning of suckers and shoots\n- Data collection & reporting\nSee if you qualify for\nThe Compact’s Tree Water Maintenance Program!

If the two species are listed, and if critical habitat is finalized as it is proposed, the draft economic analysis suggests a range of economic impacts that are possible as a result. In addition to opening a public comment period on the draft economic analysis, the Service is re-opening a public comment period on the proposal to designate critical habitat for these mussels under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) for 30 days by May 29, 2013, in order to allow comments on the draft analysis and the proposed critical habitat designation. The Service first released the proposed critical habitat designation for public comment in October 2012. The fluted kidneyshell and the slabside pearlymussel are only found in portions of the Cumberland and Tennessee River systems of Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia. They have both been eliminated from more than 60 percent of the total number of streams where they historically lived. Only a handful of populations of both species are considered biologically viable. The primary reasons for these mussels’ decline include impoundments, mining, oil and gas exploration, sedimentation, chemical contaminants, temperature alterations, recurring drought and flooding, population fragmentation and isolation, loss of fish hosts, and the introduced, invasive Asian clam. The economic analysis estimates the total incremental cost of critical habitat designation to be up to $3.5 million over 20 years. These costs stem from the requirement for federal agencies to consult with the Service regarding the impacts of their actions, or those that they fund or authorize, on critical habitat. Other sectors of the economy likely to be subject to the impacts include commercial, industrial, residential, utility development, agricultural, and recreational development. The majorities of these costs are administrative and may be borne by federal and state agencies; however, some costs may be incurred by local governments and businesses if federal funding or a federal permit is involved. Critical habitat is a term defined in the ESA. It refers to specific geographic areas that are essential to the conservation of a threatened or endangered species and which may require special management considerations or protection. The designation of critical habitat on private land has no impact on private landowner activities that do not require federal funding or permits. In total, the Service is proposing 27 critical habitat units encompassing 1,380 miles (2,218 km) in Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia for the fluted kidneyshell and slabside pearlymussel. Some of the units overlap and are proposed critical habitat for both species. Here are the proposed critical habitat designations for each mussel. For the fluted kidneyshell, the Service is proposing 24 critical habitat units encompassing 1,182 miles (1,899 km) of stream channel in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia. For the slabside pearlymussel, thirteen critical habitat units encompassing 971 miles (1,562 km) of stream channel in Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia are proposed for the slabside pearlymussel. The fluted kidneyshell’s proposed designation includes eight streams of unoccupied habitat. There are no unoccupied streams designated for the slabside pearlymussel. All streams proposed as critical habitat are occupied by one of these species, or by another previously listed mussel species. Unoccupied habitats provide additional habitat for population expansion and promote genetic diversity, which will decrease the risk of extinction for these two species. For example, the Elk, Holston, and French Broad rivers are being proposed as unoccupied critical habitat for the fluted kidneyshell. This species was once found in these areas.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e4126aa3-fdc7-4b9a-8930-183a300c2337>"]},{"passage":"Environmental Information and Assessment of Environmental Impacts\nThe National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to evaluate the potential effects of their activities and programs on the quality of the human environment.

Therefore, the flow would have to be diverted away from that part of the river. 2. There are 700 people in line for a popular amusement-park ride when the ride begins operation in the morning. Once it begins operation, the ride accepts passengers until the park closes 8 hours later. While there is a line, people move onto the ride at a rate of 800 people per hour. The graph below shows the rate, r(t), at which people arrive at the ride throughout the day. Time t is measured in hours from the time the ride begins operation. How many people arrive at the ride between t = 0 and t = 3? Show the computations. The number of riders who arrived at the ride between t=0 and t=3 can be calculated using the trapezoidal rule and the graph below. This can be done because the area under the curve on the given interval corresponds to the number of riders who arrived in that time frame. Two trapezoids can be made on the given interval, one from t=0 to t=2 and the second on the interval t=2 to t=3. For the first trapezoid, the heights are 1000 and 1200, and the width is 2 so the area is 2200, and for the second trapezoid the heights are 1200 and 800, with a width of 1 so the area is 1000. Therefore, the resulting total area under the curve and number of passengers who arrived at the ride between t=0 and t=3 was 3200 passengers. Is the number of people waiting in line to get on the ride increasing or decreasing between t = 2 and t = 3? Justify. The number of people waiting to get on the ride is increasing between t=2 and t=3 because the rate at which passengers get onto the ride is 800 passengers per hour and while the rate at which passengers arrive at the ride is decreasing between t=2 and t=3, it is still larger than 800 passengers an hour. At what time (t) is the line for the ride the longest? How many people are in line at that time? Justify.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:7ff26b4b-465a-433d-aeff-2873d2039d77>"]},{"passage":"Using the CyArk Hazard map (linked above), locate the city of New Orleans, Louisiana. The city of New Orleans is a US city with a long history. One of the oldest cities in the US, New Orleans has become known as a cultural melting pot with a unique culture and cuisine. New Orleans is home to a rich culture, famous for their festivals, such as Mardi Gras, and is also known as the birthplace of jazz. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused considerable damage to the city of New Orleans. Many of the city's levees broke which caused water levels to rise, leaving much of the city underwater. In the events of global warming, New Orleans faces the danger of becoming submerged under the waters of the Gulf of Mexico once again. Zoom in on the city of New Orleans to zoom level 7. Have students locate New Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico. 2. On the Hazard Map, adjust the the sea levels from 0 meters to 1 meter. How is the city affected? At 5 meters sea level rise? 10 meters sea level rise? 20 meters? 3. Explain to students that if the sea levels of the world rise, the water will first flood the parts of the city with the lowest elevation. Elevation is the height of the land above the level of the sea. Rising sea levels would first affect coastal areas with low elevation. Extension for advanced students and high grade levels:\n4. Here is a map of New Orlean's elevations\nHow do the areas on this map correspond to the flooded areas in the CyArk Hazard Map? How does elevation play a role in sea level rise? How will melting glacial ice from Antarctica and Greenland affect sea levels? Find the list of materials above. Choose one of two methods below:\n1. Fill ziplock bags with water. 2. Place ziplock bags flat in the freezer and let freeze. 3. When the water has completely frozen into ice, remove the ice from the ziplock bag. You should now have a small, flat sheet of ice. 1. Using ice cubes, place about 6 ice cubes in a small container or ziplock bag. 2. Wet the ice cubes slightly and then place in the freezer. 3. Remove the ice cubes after they have frozen together to form a block of several ice cubes stuck together. 1. Fill a small plastic container with rocks or gravel. Alternatively, a small, unopened can (such as a tuna can) be be used. The container of choice should be relatively heavy to prevent the container from floating in water. This container will represent a continent or island. Place the weighted container in a large shallow pan. 2. Using sugar cubes and glue, have students construct a small city on top of the \"island.\" 3. Place another weighed container or can in the shallow pan. Place a large block of ice on top of the the weighed container. This will represent Antarctica and its thick layer of ice. 4. Using a pitcher, slowly fill the pan with water. Fill the container until the the water level reaches the top of the small container \"islands.\" Be careful not to splash water on the sugar cubes. 5. Measure the height of the water level in the pan with a ruler. Students should record the water level in their notebooks and record any observations about their sugar cube city. At this time students will write their predictions and hypothesis of what will happen as the ice cubes melt and what effect it will have on the sugar cube city. Optional: have students record their sugar cube city with a digital camera. 6. Direct the lamp towards the ice cubes in the container. The lamp represent solar activity and melts the ice cubes at a faster rate. 7. Once the sugar cubes have melted, students should measure the new water level with a ruler and record this number in their notebooks. Students should also record their observations on the sugar cube city. What happened to the city after the ice cubes melted? Did the level of the water rise? If so, by how much? Optional: have students photograph the sugar cube city after the ice melted. IV. Global Warming's Impact\nUsing the CyArk Hazard map (linked above) have students explore a local coastal town. Change the rise in sea levels to see how different parts of the city would be affected. Have students think of a recent trip to this city. How would your trip be different if the sea levels rose? What parts of the city would be different? What would be the same?","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:2df51683-e0db-4077-881d-4926565bbdab>"]},{"passage":"The consequences of the actual amount of warming that we expect to experience are horrifying, and are likely to include 80 to 250 feet of sea level rise and a dust bowl from Kansas to California\nMr. Romm next provides a litany of very bad things that he predicts are likely to occur if we do not implement a set of policies to aggressively restrict emissions. Consider Mr. Romm’s first prediction:\n- Sea level rise of 80 feet to 250 feet at a rate of 6 inches a decade (or more). A 250 foot rise in sea level would be very, very bad. It conjures up the image of massive tidal waves consuming major coastal cities. But this forecast is problematic for at least a couple of reasons. First, I don’t understand its internal logic. At 6 inches per decade, it would take 1,600 years to get to 80 feet, and 5,000 years to get to 250 feet. I assume we are not trying to consider effects in the years 3600 AD to 7000 AD. Second, while Mr. Romm doesn’t provide attribution for this forecast, it isn’t anything like any formal prediction I’ve ever seen from the IPCC. The IPCC is appropriately reserved about making predictions for sea level rise. They don’t provide best estimates by scenario, but just broad ranges. They also caution that the high end of any range is not an absolute maximum. The spread of IPCC projections for sea level rise through about 2100 across all six marker scenarios ranges from a low of 0.18 meters to a high of 0.59 meters. (See WG1 SPM, Table SPM.3) Crudely, these average about 0.4 meters, or about 15 inches total by about 2100. That’s quite a ways from 80 to 250 feet. Consider Mr. Romm’s second prediction:\nMr. Romm links to a blog post about a news report about a single climate simulation model study to support this. (Read the comments section on the page to which Mr. Romm links). The IPCC certainly does make predictions that large amounts of land, especially in Latin America (See WG2 Chapter 13, pages 583 and 597) and some other equatorial areas, will be subject to “desertification processes,” and this would be a serious problem, but I have not seen a claim as dramatic as Mr. Romm’s proceed from the IPCC process. Consider this in the context of Mr. Romm’s closely related prediction, also based on a blog citation of another single study using climate simulation models, for aridity impacts for the U.S.:\n…”a permanent drought by 2050 throughout the Southwest” – levels of aridity comparable to the 1930s Dust Bowl would stretch from Kansas to California. And they were only looking at a 720 ppm case! This is a pretty bleak picture of what, for example, the U.S. will look like: a 21st century army of Joads escaping an interior apocalypse, only to arrive at the coasts to find the cities flooded under hundreds of feet of water. In contrast, here is the complete list of “examples of projected impacts” that the IPCC provides to illustrate the effects of climate change for the continent of North America (See Synthesis Report, Summary for Policymakers, page 11):\n- Warming in western mountains is projected to cause decreased snowpack, more winter flooding and reduced summer flows, exacerbating competition for over-allocated water resources. - In the early decades of the century, moderate climate change is projected to increase aggregate yields of rain-fed agriculture by 5 to 20%, but with important variability among regions. Major challenges are projected for crops that are near the warm end of their suitable range or which depend on highly utilized water resources. - Cities that currently experience heat waves are expected to be further challenged by an increased number, intensity and duration of heat waves during the course of the century, with potential for adverse health impacts. - Coastal communities and habitats will be increasingly stressed by climate change impacts interacting with development and pollution. While serious, this doesn’t sound quite so dramatic. And so on with various other of Mr. Romm’s predictions. The negative consequences of a several degree increase in global temperatures would almost certainly be quite significant. In addition, these consequences would likely be felt disproportionately by poor people in developing countries, especially those near the equator. Exaggerating these effects, however, is not helpful.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:3a3782a7-7a8e-4ec6-a3d3-418ad8ba1154>"]}]}

Well that’s flattering, but it also says something about you; we’re in the biz so we know that’s good - like, really good - FMs are not a dime a dozen. By now, you’re familiar with most of the knowledge areas you’ll need in order to succeed in this field. Today we’re going to wrap up our mini-series with our final two competencies, Environmental Awareness and Emergency Preparedness. Here is where you get the chance to earn eco-friendly cred and impress the Board of Directors at the same time. As a solid Facility Manager, you need to be aware of wasting resources - earthly, green resources like energy, which is also tied to the other resource: money. What does that mean, exactly? Ensuring thermostats are programmed to make the most efficient use of energy during business hours, making environmentally sensitive choices in regards to building materials and furnishings, and keeping tabs on areas of potential waste. In today’s eco-conscious world, Facility Managers play an increasingly important role in reducing a building’s carbon footprint. Some examples of changes you could implement include things like smart lighting, grey water capture, solar panels and even things like composting and soft plastic recycling programs. A lot of the aforementioned strategies reduce environmental impact straight out of the gate and end up saving money in the long term. Other ideas that don’t cost any money include donating or repurposing old office furniture and choosing office space that’s along a bike or bus-friendly route. Quick - where’s your first aid kit? If you answered “Which one? The mini one in my pocket right now, or the full sized ones in my car, house and both my kids’ backpacks?” then you’re so cut out for this job. Facility Managers have a plan for every type of emergency - it’s part of the gig. This includes evacuation plans for fire, earthquake (where applicable) and more sinister situations like security threats. You’ll also need to establish protocols for power outages, pipe bursts\/floods and basically anything else that could go wrong. You’re the one who knows where all the fire extinguishers are and when they expire. You know 10 ways out of the building in case any one way is blocked. You’re the one who they call to complain about the lack of good options in the vending machines (and that is definitely an emergency prune & flax breakfast bars, really? Come on.) Thanks for following our ‘So You Wanna Be A Facility Manager’ blog series! Hopefully you’ve learned a little bit more about what it takes to hack it in the FM profession. Like we said in our first post, it’s a dynamic and thriving field of work with experienced corporate FMs typically bringing in a sixfigure salary. As a wise uncle once said, with great power comes great responsibility. Are you already working as a Facility Manager? We’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback on our competency list. Give us a shout!

In a world where climate change has become a very real and pressing matter, companies are in a unique position to be catalysts for real change. By altering their consumption habits, businesses can set new precedents in their industries and begin the long road to reversing the rising tide of carbon emissions worldwide. Energy Consultants typically work for companies that run large-scale production facilities or manufacturing plants with high energy demands. But as the regulatory legislation becomes ever more stringent, the demand for energy consultation is extending into many fields and sectors. Energy Consultant Job Description\nThe job of an Energy Consultant spans a broad range of skills and areas of knowledge. Companies have an economic incentive to become more energy efficient, both because of potential tax benefits and also simply because the cost of energy is a significant expenditure for many businesses. So, Energy Consultants start by examining the usage patterns of the companies that hire them. The energy experts study all sources of energy the company has drawn from over the course of the past few years, investigate potential local and technological options for achieving greater efficiencies, and conduct feasibility studies to determine challenges to implementing green solutions, this might mean switching to solar or wind energy, for instance. Or it might mean upgrading inefficient machinery to newer models with greater efficiency. They typically work for large corporations, and so their studies often necessitate evaluating multi-step manufacturing or production processes that occur in multiple facilities that are geographically dispersed so the complexity of the energy consumption picture for a business is often incredibly complicated, necessitating careful study, thorough analysis, and creative problem solving. 5 Primary Responsibilities Of An Energy Consultant\n- Reduce Consumption: The ultimate goal of the profession is to examine every possible option for cutting usage, this might mean implementing new technology, reversing wasteful habits, or even altering manufacturing or production processes. - Increase Efficiency: Most often, increases in efficiency are achieved through the implementation of new technology or the transition to renewable sources like solar panels or wind turbines. It is the consultant’s job to evaluate which options are best suited for the company in question. - Evaluate Systems: To institute greener systems and policies, an Energy Consultant must first painstakingly evaluate the usage demands of the current systems in place. These systems range from working hours to machinery to the energy awareness of employees, all of which fall under the purview of the consultant. - Map Usage: Many major corporations function through a complex system of interconnected facilities, shipping routes, offices, and warehouses. In many cases, these companies have never had a map of their total energy usage and have thus never been able to have a comprehensive picture of how and where the company consumes the most energy resources. - Provide Options: As with all consultant work, the duty of an EC is to provide as many actionable options as possible, with detailed explanations of the pros and cons and feasibility of each possibility, to help the company’s officers decide what and how to go about improving efficiency. 10 Day-to-Day Energy Consultancy Duties\n- Study current energy sources\n- Investigate alternate energy sources\n- Evaluate the company’s usage about regulatory requirements for the industry and proposed regulatory requirements expected in the future\n- Write concise, clear reports about findings and suggestions\n- Justify conclusions in meetings with executives\n- Meet with managers and employees to form a clear picture of consumption habits\n- Analyse data using data modelling software\n- Conduct feasibility studies\n- Brainstorm creative solutions to identified problems\n- Participate in routine visits to customers\nEnergy Consultant Salary\nThe average salary for an Energy Consultant in the UK is about £27,000 annually. Those in the upper echelons of the profession, however, can earn more than £50,000. Many Energy Consultants work on a contract basis, though there are also many full-time positions in the field.

Well that’s flattering, but it also says something about you; we’re in the biz so we know that’s good - like, really good - FMs are not a dime a dozen. By now, you’re familiar with most of the knowledge areas you’ll need in order to succeed in this field. Today we’re going to wrap up our mini-series with our final two competencies, Environmental Awareness and Emergency Preparedness. Here is where you get the chance to earn eco-friendly cred and impress the Board of Directors at the same time. As a solid Facility Manager, you need to be aware of wasting resources - earthly, green resources like energy, which is also tied to the other resource: money. What does that mean, exactly? Ensuring thermostats are programmed to make the most efficient use of energy during business hours, making environmentally sensitive choices in regards to building materials and furnishings, and keeping tabs on areas of potential waste. In today’s eco-conscious world, Facility Managers play an increasingly important role in reducing a building’s carbon footprint. Some examples of changes you could implement include things like smart lighting, grey water capture, solar panels and even things like composting and soft plastic recycling programs. A lot of the aforementioned strategies reduce environmental impact straight out of the gate and end up saving money in the long term. Other ideas that don’t cost any money include donating or repurposing old office furniture and choosing office space that’s along a bike or bus-friendly route. Quick - where’s your first aid kit? If you answered “Which one? The mini one in my pocket right now, or the full sized ones in my car, house and both my kids’ backpacks?” then you’re so cut out for this job. Facility Managers have a plan for every type of emergency - it’s part of the gig. This includes evacuation plans for fire, earthquake (where applicable) and more sinister situations like security threats. You’ll also need to establish protocols for power outages, pipe bursts\/floods and basically anything else that could go wrong. You’re the one who knows where all the fire extinguishers are and when they expire. You know 10 ways out of the building in case any one way is blocked. You’re the one who they call to complain about the lack of good options in the vending machines (and that is definitely an emergency prune & flax breakfast bars, really? Come on.) Thanks for following our ‘So You Wanna Be A Facility Manager’ blog series! Hopefully you’ve learned a little bit more about what it takes to hack it in the FM profession.

Last week it was Huang Hua, once Vice Prime Minister of China, who entertained my father and the members of his family traveling with him in a dining hall in the Forbidden City in Beijing. More on that later. The other was Joan Hinton, whom I met on a collective farm in rural China. My father led a group of American agriculturalists around China for 30 days in 1984. Instead of just visiting the cities, we spent much of our time in the country so that the agricultural scientists could talk with the people running the large farming operations. Joan Hinton and her husband were on a farm that had a large dairy operation that Hinton’s husband, Erwin Engst, had helped build. The couple had raised their children in China and Mrs. Hinton told me that her son, who had returned to the United States for college, had an accent that for some reason was mistaken as German, not Chinese. The Hintons wore Mao jackets, which was curious since this was twelve years after Nixon’s visit and eight years after Mao’s death. Most government officials by then were wearing well-tailored Italian suits. My father said that Engst and others had built a very good dairy operation from scratch, and he was impressed. He did not know anything about Hinton and it was only after her obituary appeared in the New York Times in June of this year that I learned of her connection to the Manhattan project and the suspicion that she may have been a spy. The couple struck me as good natured old lefties of the sort that one could still find in the coffee shops along Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley in the 60s talking about visiting Trotsky in Mexico before his assassination by Stalin's agents. Huang Hua was a very different story and to tell what I know about him requires that I explain why my father was in China in the first place, By the time I went with him in 1984 my father and mother had been to China five times. They had first gone in 1972. When Nixon returned from China my father got a call from Earl Butz, then Secretary of Agriculture, whom my father had known for more than a decade. As my father told it, Butz’s first words were, “You’re going to China.” My father had no connection with China and asked why. “They asked for you,” was Butz’s reply. “But why me?” my father asked. “I don’t know.” In time my father did find out. In the 1950s, he had written up some research he found in a journal published in Hong Kong. The paper had been roughly translated into English and my father saw the results as significant. He wrote about this in several places, but never knew that it had come out of Red China. He told me he had assumed it had been done in Taiwan or Hong Kong. My father’s attention gave the paper international recognition at a time when Chinese research was often ignored by western scientific publications. The Chinese never forgot and when Butz asked if they had a preference about who could lead the first exchange of livestock producers, they asked for my father. So in late 1972 my father went to China. He met several officials and spoke at the University of Beijing, but he spent most of his time talking to the leaders of collective farms. Because he went to parts of China where no American had been for a generation, his return flight was routed through Washington where he was debriefed by someone from the Pentagon. According to my father, he made a lousy spy because, in his words, \"I couldn't tell a missile silo from a grain silo.\" (Actually I'm quite sure he could, but it was probably his way of saying that the debriefing made him uncomfortable. He thought that agriculture should be outside of politics, if not above it.) My father kept going back. Several times he asked me to come with him, but the time required either conflicted with school (I was in law school until 1974) or work. Finally I went in 1984. The dinner in the dining hall in the Forbidden City with Huang Hua and his wife was perhaps the most unique event I have ever attended. My father had been dealing with the Vice Prime Minister for years and the two had become friends, but the rest of us were in awe of the man who had met with Henry Kissinger to bring down the barriers that had separated China from the United States since 1949.\n\nIn India, Alexander smashed a local Indian army and marveled at its elephants. But even as Alexander continued lusting after new discoveries in the East, his men began to rebel. Alexander dreamed of continuing on to China; his men dreamed of going home to Greece. Finally, Alexander gave in, though a report said he retreated to his tent and broke down in sobs of fury and disappointment. Instead of returning as he had come, he marched south to the coast of the Indian Ocean, where he divided his army into three parts. One was to return by ship, while the other two would march overland. The middle route, which Alexander personally led, was across the barren, lifeless stretch of land called the Makran Desert—an area avoided by travelers to this day. Alexander’s men were decimated by the burning sun and parched landscape, but Alexander survived. When he returned to Babylon, Alexander had been in the East for seven years and had conquered most of the known world. But instead of resting, Alexander ordered a fleet to prepare to sail around the Persian coast. Alexander’s dream was never realized. At age 33, he died of disease. Who were the early Chinese explorers? While the empires of the western world were expanding eastward, explorers from the Chinese Empire were venturing west. The first motive of the Chinese was to establish\nBut a second motive emerged after A.D. 400—religion. Buddhism emerged in India in the sixth century B.c. and spread to China. Later, Chinese pilgrims would travel to India to discover more about the Buddha and his teachings. Who was Chang Ch’ien the Chinese explorer? Chang Ch’ien was one of the earliest and most famous Chinese explorers. In 138 B.C., the Emperor Wu Ti sent Ch’ien west on a mission to find allies. But he was captured by China’s enemy, the Huns, and spent ten years in captivity. He escaped and made contact with the Yiieh-chih, a nomadic tribe in what is today Afghanistan. Ch’ien reported back to the Chinese emperor in 116,B.c. Wu Ti sent him on another mission the following year, this time to the Wu-Sun, a tribe that lived in what is today southern Russia. On this journey, Ch’ien compiled information on Fergana, a city in Uzbekistan, and India and Parthia—modem-day Iran. When Ch’ien’s journeys were complete, China had made contact with the civilization established by Alexander the Great. The Roman and Chinese empires began to exchange goods. What was the Silk Road? The Silk Road was a 4,000-mile-long trading route between the civilizations of Rome and China. Caravans carrying Chinese goods—especially silk—traveled out of northwest China, around the burning desert sands of Takla Makan, over the Pamir Mountains north of India, into Mesopotamia, and finally arrived at the eastern end of the Mediterranean. No one group made the trip. Instead, the goods were passed from one group to another, often taking years to reach their destination. The groups inhabiting the middle of the Silk Road made enormous profits from the trade, and they tried to prevent any direct contact between China and the Roman Empire. Who was Fa-hsien the Chinese Buddhist traveller? Fa-hsien was born in the Chinese city of Shansi sometime in the fourth century A.D. As a young man, Fa-hsien became an avid follower of Buddha. He resolved to visit India to see where the Buddha had lived his life and visit temples and shrines of Buddhist teaching. According to an account written by Fa-hsien titled Fo Kua Chi (Record of Buddhist Kingdoms), it took him more than five years to journey from China to central India. “In the desert were numerous evil spirits and scorching winds, causing death to anyone who would meet them,” he wrote. “Above there were no birds, while on the ground there were no animals. One looked as far as one could in all directions for a path to cross, but there was none to choose. Only the dried bones of the dead served as indications.” Fa-hsien wrote of mountains where he climbed sheer cliffs 8,000 feet tall.\n\nTimeline of Chinese immigration to the United States\nThis timeline covers Chinese immigration to the United States, including both temporary and permanent migration. Among the topics discussed are: migration patterns, source and target regions of migration, laws (U.S. federal and state, and Chinese) that target or significantly affect migration patterns, court cases and administrative\/bureaucratic developments affecting migration. |Year||Month and date (if available)||Event type||Affected region||Details|\n|1644||Regime change||China||The Qing dynasty takes over control of China from the Ming dynasty, and maintains the capital at Beijing. Resistance to the Qing, initially led by the deposed Ming, builds in South China, mainly the province of Guangdong. After the Ming resistance is killed off, dissatisfaction with the Qing dynasty continues, and interest in alternative systems is developed through the exchange of goods and ideas carried out via the ports in the South China Sea, such as the Port of Guangdong. In the 19th century, the residents of Guangdong and nearby southern provinces, such as Fujian, develop interest in the United States, due to a mix of its wealth, novel system of government, and success at overthrowing its imperial overlords the British.|\n|1815||Beginning of migration||California||Migration from China to the United States begins at a very small scale, along with the opening of trade between China and the United States. See the Wikipedia page History of Chinese Americans for more context.|\n|1834||Beginning of migration||New York City||Afong Moy is the first Chinese woman to arrive in the United States. She is brought from her home town of Guangzhou to New York City by Nathaniel and Frederick Carne, who exhibit her as \"the Chinese Lady\".|\n|1839–1842||War||China||The First Opium War occurs, culminating in the highly unequal Treaty of Nanking. The war disproportionately impacts South China, including the provinces that would see significant emigration to the United States in later years, though its causal role is unclear. The war also leads to negative views of the British in South China, although the negative views do not extend to the American, for whom some affinity remains given their success at achieving independence from the British.|\n|1842–1900||Missionary activity||China||Protestant missions in China become more active following the opening of ports as a result of the Treaty of Nanking. These help spread Christianity in China and make some Chinese more familiar with the English language.|\n|1844||July 3||Treaty||United States||The Treaty of Wanghia is signed at the Kun Iam Temple between the United States of America (represented by Caleb Cushing, a lawyer dispatched by President John Tyler) and Keying, the Viceroy of Liangguang, representing the Qing Empire that rules China. It would be ratified by United States President John Tyler on January 17, 1845. The treaty is an unequal treaty, and its 34 articles deal with assuring the rights of US ships, traders, and citizens in China. Reciprocal rights of Chinese traders and citizens in the United States are not covered. Subsequent treaties would be more equal.|\n|1848||January||Beginning of migration||California||Gold is discovered in California, leading to a California Gold Rush. A number of people from China arrive in the United States to participate in the Gold Rush. Before 1848, the total number of Chinese in the United States is only 325; soon, annual immigration from China exceeds this amount.|\n|1848||February||Jurisdictional definitions and boundaries||California||The Mexican–American War concludes, and Alta California (which includes the modern U.S. state of California, plus nearby regions) is established to be part of the United States.|\n|1849||Organization||California (San Francisco)||The Chew Yick Association, one of the earliest organizations of Chinese in the United States, elects Norman As-sing, a prominent Chinese merchant, as their leader.\n\nSo far\nno U.S. account of the meeting has surfaced but Ambassador Hilaly\ndebriefed Harold Saunders on the discussions several weeks later. Hilaly's account of the meeting showed Nixon asking President\nYahya to \"convey his feelings to the Chinese at the highest\nlevel\" that he believed that 1) \"Asia can not move forward\nif a nation as large as China remains isolated,\" and 2) the\nUnited States would not be \"party to any arrangements designed\nto isolate China.\" With this conversation, Nixon had taken\nthe first step toward opening a secret channel through Pakistan\nthat would later prove decisive. 3: Xiong Xianghui, \"The Prelude to the Opening of Sino-American\nRelations,\" Zhonggong dangshi ziliao [CCP History\nMaterials] No. 42 (June 1992), excerpts\nIn the early 1990s, Xiong Xianghui published the first historical\naccount, along with documents, of a special study group tasked\nby Chairman Mao in 1969 to review China's strategic policy. Xiong,\nformerly an aide to Zhou Enlai, had been the secretary to this\ngroup, which consisted of four marshals, senior military figures\nwho had been sent to inspect factories during the Cultural Revolution. The four marshals first focused on relations with Moscow just\nas the Sino-Soviet border clashes were breaking out; although\nthey saw the Soviets as dangerous, they doubted that Moscow intended\nto launch war against China. After Lin Biao gave a speech harshly\nattacking U.S. and Soviet imperialism, Mao asked the marshals\nto think outside the box about U.S. and Soviet policy. The four\nmarshals initially doubted that the Soviets and the Americans\nwould act against China either separately or jointly. When the\nborder fighting intensified in August 1969, marshals Chen Yi and\nYe Jianying worried about a confrontation with Moscow and proposed\nplaying the \"card of the United States.\" In a separate\nreport, Chen proposed high-level talks with the U.S. in order\nto solve basic problems in the relationship. The fourth line of\nthe third page reproduced here includes the text about playing\nthe American card. (Note 1)\n4: Front page of People's Daily, 25 December 1970, showing\nfrom left, Edgar Snow, interpreter Ji Chaozhu, Mao Zedong, and\nLin Biao, at a reviewing stand facing Tiananmen Square on 1 October\nSource: Library of Congress\nIn another attempt to signal to the U.S. government but also\na domestic audience about the need for a new relationship with\nthe United States, on 1 October 1970 (National Day), Mao had journalist\nEdgar Snow stand by him at the Gate of Heavenly Peace during the\nparade. Several months later, Snow met with Mao for five hours\nof talks on 18 December 1970 during which the Chairman said the\n[T]he foreign ministry was studying the matter of admitting\nAmericans from the left, middle, and right to visit China. Should\nrightists like Nixon, who represented the monopoly capitalists,\nbe permitted to come? He should be welcomed because, Mao explained\nat present the problems between China and the US would have\nto be solved with Nixon. Mao would be happy to talk with him,\neither as a tourist or as President. A week later, perhaps to reaffirm that something was afoot with\nSino-American relations, People's Daily published a picture\nof Mao and Snow from the National Day event. While the China expert\nAllen Whiting proposed going to Switzerland to debrief Snow about\nhis trip to China and meetings with the leadership, John Holdridge,\nthe China expert on Kissinger's staff, advised against that on\nthe grounds that Snow was a leftist. Had the debriefing gone ahead,\nNixon could have learned that Mao had invited him to China, months\nbefore Snow made it public in Life magazine at the end\nof April 1971.

By 1953, as Singer notes in his article \"Robert Redfield,\" the organizers had \"decided to concentrate the Projects resources on the study of Indian civilization because of the interest and availability of anthropologists who had recently done Indian village studies.\" Participants were quick to conclude \"that while village studies can be used as points of entry for a study of Indian civilization, they were not the only available points.\" At the same time, Redfield and Singer \"sketched somewhat speculatively a conceptual framework for studying the formation and transformation of cities\" within particular civilizations, including that of India. Their jointly authored paper, \"The Cultural Role of Cities,\" offered a \"conception of a civilization as a historic structure of interacting little and great traditions,\" and provided the blueprint for a social anthropology of civilizations that would study larger civilizational systems \"from the bottom up.\" Subsequently they created a set of core courses in non-Western civilizations at Chicago and established South Asia as an area of particular interest to Chicago scholars pursuing questions of social change in a rapidly modernizing world. The towards India within the Redfield Project, as it came to be known, was given its most explicit expression in a memo from Singer to Redfield, written shortly after Singers return from his first trip to India in 1955. In it, Singer argues for committing the next five years of the Comparative Civilizations Project solely to India:\nIndia remains, in my opinion, the best place to study the interaction of little and great traditions, the social organization of tradition, \"cultural structure,\" and related problems. The coexistence of different levels of culture for a very long period of time has produced types of mutual interaction and continuity which in other civilizations can only be guessed at but which in India can be observed first-hand. During the ensuing decade, the earnest scholarship begun with Redfields Comparative Civilizations Project fostered new projects focused on South Asia. The Project had established a model of cultural study which, largely through the continuing efforts of Singer, was transmitted to the developing South Asian program at Chicago. It had emphasized study of other cultures for broadly humanistic reasons, not tied to any governmental definition of the national interest as was fashionable in the 1950s. It aimed not at producing useful expertise, but at increasing international understanding. Finally, it had stressed the study of India as a civilization, not (as most area studies did) as a geographical or political entity. The emphasis on classical traditions and cultural history still informs the Chicago program today. A Committee for South Asian Studies\nSouth Asian studies at Chicago is currently organized under six units, each contributing to the breadth of Chicagos scholarly programs. The next cases trace the development of these units: 1) the Committee on Southern Asian Studies (COSAS); 2) the South Asian Civilization teaching program in the undergraduate college; 3) the South Asian Languages and Area Center (SALAC); 4) the Department of South Asian Languages and Civilizations; 5) the South Asia library collection; and 6) the University of Chicago Press. South Asian studies at the University of Chicago was made possible by the arrival in the early 1950s of several professors who shared a deep interest in the area. India was a newly independent democracy with a long historical tradition. Many established scholars chose to pursue their particular disciplines in India when the recently-created Fulbright and Rockefeller grants began supporting research abroad. By 1954, professors at Chicago who had benefited from such grants -- including Robert Redfield, Milton Singer, Edward Shils, Richard McKeon, Bert Hoselitz, Donald Lach, Philip Hauser, Gilbert White, Francis Chase and Robert Crane -- began to meet as an informal planning committee. In 1955 that informal planning developed into the Committee on South Asian Studies (COSAS). (The name was later changed to the Committee on Southern Asian Studies, reflecting the contribution of Southeast Asian specialists to the program.) The formation of a Committee composed of faculty from different academic departments was assisted by a tradition of interdisciplinary cooperation at the University of Chicago. COSAS became an official Committee with four major aims: coordinating research activities, recommending and preparing undergraduate-level teaching materials, developing advanced programs for graduate students specializing in South Asia, and providing facilities and guidance for South Asian students.\n\nHistory 1302 Writing Assignment #1.

In a June meeting of the group, Chen and Voitinsky moved for the group to take action toward founding a Party, but many of the senior radicals who had been happy to have discussions did not think that China needed a separate Communist Party. After all, didn’t Marxism state that China needed more capitalist development to have a socialist revolution? These figures felt that a revolutionary nationalist group like the Guomindang was more appropriate to China’s situation. Clearly, these radicals drew different conclusions from the Russian experience of socialist revolution in a majority-peasant population country than Chen and Voitinsky did. So, with the efforts to constitute a local nucleus for founding a Communist Party frustrated, Chen and Voitinsky called another meeting in August, which they didn’t invite the people who didn’t want to found a Communist Party to, and there they formed a cell of about ten members who saw their task as preparing for the foundation of the Party. Chen had remained the editor of New Youth, the flagship journal of the New Culture and May 4th Movements, and beginning with its September 1920 issue, New Youth began to systematically report on events in the Soviet Union and to explain Marxism to a mass audience, in a way that had not happened before in China. The activism of the Shanghai group won Li Dazhao and the Beijing study group to become more active in organizational efforts, and to get on board with the goal of founding a party. Members of the Shanghai nucleus and from the Soviet delegation helped to start communist cells in Wuhan and Jinan, and Mao Zedong met with both the Beijing and Shanghai groups before going back to Changsha in Hunan Province to start a group there. In every case, the new communist nuclei were based on pre-existing groups of activists who had been involved in the May 4th Movement. For example, in Changsha members of the New Citizens’ Study Society that Mao participated in had been debating for some time about how to accomplish their stated goal of changing China and the world, which was admittedly vague. In the end, they decided that the model of the Bolshevik Revolution was the way that the world could be changed. Chen Duxiu moved to Guangzhou in November 1920 to take up a position as commissioner of education in the provincial government there, and it was only then that a communist nucleus was formed in that city. Chen’s move to Guangzhou right in the midst of the efforts to gather momentum to found a Communist Party points to a notable early feature of communist activism. Essentially, when Chen moved to Guangzhou, he was putting his career ahead of his revolutionary efforts. After all, Shanghai was the center of the efforts to found a communist party, and Chen had been playing a leading role in that process. All of a sudden, he put that on a back burner for a while as he put his career first. So while later on communist leaders would be expected to devote their lives to the revolution, we can see that as the movement was taking off, things were still very loose organizationally. So, how did these separate communist nuclei in cities around China go from being separate local groups that wanted to form a Communist Party to actually going ahead and forming one? What was involved in that? There were two major questions that had to be addressed, one was organizational, and the other was ideological. The principles for organizing a communist party which were followed, or at least supposed to be followed, by all the parties of the Third International had been worked out by Lenin over the long years of struggle within the Russian Social-Democratic Party between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. Lenin’s Bolsheviks advocated a much tighter, more centralized form of party organization than the Mensheviks or other Social-Democratic parties did before the Russian Revolution. Lenin’s ideas on party organization proved to be central to the success of the Russian Revolution, and so the idea was that the Communist parties of the Third International should organize themselves along the lines advocated by Lenin. Because these party principles are so different from what people in the world today typically think of when they think of a political party, I am going to review some of the main points here.","passages":[{"passage":"Understanding China And Ourselves\nMark Seldon blogs in a series titled “My First Trip to China”.

Last week it was Huang Hua, once Vice Prime Minister of China, who entertained my father and the members of his family traveling with him in a dining hall in the Forbidden City in Beijing. More on that later. The other was Joan Hinton, whom I met on a collective farm in rural China. My father led a group of American agriculturalists around China for 30 days in 1984. Instead of just visiting the cities, we spent much of our time in the country so that the agricultural scientists could talk with the people running the large farming operations. Joan Hinton and her husband were on a farm that had a large dairy operation that Hinton’s husband, Erwin Engst, had helped build. The couple had raised their children in China and Mrs. Hinton told me that her son, who had returned to the United States for college, had an accent that for some reason was mistaken as German, not Chinese. The Hintons wore Mao jackets, which was curious since this was twelve years after Nixon’s visit and eight years after Mao’s death. Most government officials by then were wearing well-tailored Italian suits. My father said that Engst and others had built a very good dairy operation from scratch, and he was impressed. He did not know anything about Hinton and it was only after her obituary appeared in the New York Times in June of this year that I learned of her connection to the Manhattan project and the suspicion that she may have been a spy. The couple struck me as good natured old lefties of the sort that one could still find in the coffee shops along Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley in the 60s talking about visiting Trotsky in Mexico before his assassination by Stalin's agents. Huang Hua was a very different story and to tell what I know about him requires that I explain why my father was in China in the first place, By the time I went with him in 1984 my father and mother had been to China five times. They had first gone in 1972. When Nixon returned from China my father got a call from Earl Butz, then Secretary of Agriculture, whom my father had known for more than a decade. As my father told it, Butz’s first words were, “You’re going to China.” My father had no connection with China and asked why. “They asked for you,” was Butz’s reply. “But why me?” my father asked. “I don’t know.” In time my father did find out. In the 1950s, he had written up some research he found in a journal published in Hong Kong. The paper had been roughly translated into English and my father saw the results as significant. He wrote about this in several places, but never knew that it had come out of Red China. He told me he had assumed it had been done in Taiwan or Hong Kong. My father’s attention gave the paper international recognition at a time when Chinese research was often ignored by western scientific publications. The Chinese never forgot and when Butz asked if they had a preference about who could lead the first exchange of livestock producers, they asked for my father. So in late 1972 my father went to China. He met several officials and spoke at the University of Beijing, but he spent most of his time talking to the leaders of collective farms. Because he went to parts of China where no American had been for a generation, his return flight was routed through Washington where he was debriefed by someone from the Pentagon. According to my father, he made a lousy spy because, in his words, \"I couldn't tell a missile silo from a grain silo.\" (Actually I'm quite sure he could, but it was probably his way of saying that the debriefing made him uncomfortable. He thought that agriculture should be outside of politics, if not above it.) My father kept going back. Several times he asked me to come with him, but the time required either conflicted with school (I was in law school until 1974) or work. Finally I went in 1984. The dinner in the dining hall in the Forbidden City with Huang Hua and his wife was perhaps the most unique event I have ever attended. My father had been dealing with the Vice Prime Minister for years and the two had become friends, but the rest of us were in awe of the man who had met with Henry Kissinger to bring down the barriers that had separated China from the United States since 1949.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:0cf1f3cb-a0bb-477b-b15c-2f956a015ec7>"]},{"passage":"In India, Alexander smashed a local Indian army and marveled at its elephants. But even as Alexander continued lusting after new discoveries in the East, his men began to rebel. Alexander dreamed of continuing on to China; his men dreamed of going home to Greece. Finally, Alexander gave in, though a report said he retreated to his tent and broke down in sobs of fury and disappointment. Instead of returning as he had come, he marched south to the coast of the Indian Ocean, where he divided his army into three parts. One was to return by ship, while the other two would march overland. The middle route, which Alexander personally led, was across the barren, lifeless stretch of land called the Makran Desert—an area avoided by travelers to this day. Alexander’s men were decimated by the burning sun and parched landscape, but Alexander survived. When he returned to Babylon, Alexander had been in the East for seven years and had conquered most of the known world. But instead of resting, Alexander ordered a fleet to prepare to sail around the Persian coast. Alexander’s dream was never realized. At age 33, he died of disease. Who were the early Chinese explorers? While the empires of the western world were expanding eastward, explorers from the Chinese Empire were venturing west. The first motive of the Chinese was to establish\nBut a second motive emerged after A.D. 400—religion. Buddhism emerged in India in the sixth century B.c. and spread to China. Later, Chinese pilgrims would travel to India to discover more about the Buddha and his teachings. Who was Chang Ch’ien the Chinese explorer? Chang Ch’ien was one of the earliest and most famous Chinese explorers. In 138 B.C., the Emperor Wu Ti sent Ch’ien west on a mission to find allies. But he was captured by China’s enemy, the Huns, and spent ten years in captivity. He escaped and made contact with the Yiieh-chih, a nomadic tribe in what is today Afghanistan. Ch’ien reported back to the Chinese emperor in 116,B.c. Wu Ti sent him on another mission the following year, this time to the Wu-Sun, a tribe that lived in what is today southern Russia. On this journey, Ch’ien compiled information on Fergana, a city in Uzbekistan, and India and Parthia—modem-day Iran. When Ch’ien’s journeys were complete, China had made contact with the civilization established by Alexander the Great. The Roman and Chinese empires began to exchange goods. What was the Silk Road? The Silk Road was a 4,000-mile-long trading route between the civilizations of Rome and China. Caravans carrying Chinese goods—especially silk—traveled out of northwest China, around the burning desert sands of Takla Makan, over the Pamir Mountains north of India, into Mesopotamia, and finally arrived at the eastern end of the Mediterranean. No one group made the trip. Instead, the goods were passed from one group to another, often taking years to reach their destination. The groups inhabiting the middle of the Silk Road made enormous profits from the trade, and they tried to prevent any direct contact between China and the Roman Empire. Who was Fa-hsien the Chinese Buddhist traveller? Fa-hsien was born in the Chinese city of Shansi sometime in the fourth century A.D. As a young man, Fa-hsien became an avid follower of Buddha. He resolved to visit India to see where the Buddha had lived his life and visit temples and shrines of Buddhist teaching. According to an account written by Fa-hsien titled Fo Kua Chi (Record of Buddhist Kingdoms), it took him more than five years to journey from China to central India. “In the desert were numerous evil spirits and scorching winds, causing death to anyone who would meet them,” he wrote. “Above there were no birds, while on the ground there were no animals. One looked as far as one could in all directions for a path to cross, but there was none to choose. Only the dried bones of the dead served as indications.” Fa-hsien wrote of mountains where he climbed sheer cliffs 8,000 feet tall.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ee994256-6eb6-47f8-895e-06bd595c5def>"]},{"passage":"Timeline of Chinese immigration to the United States\nThis timeline covers Chinese immigration to the United States, including both temporary and permanent migration.

Resistance to the Qing, initially led by the deposed Ming, builds in South China, mainly the province of Guangdong. After the Ming resistance is killed off, dissatisfaction with the Qing dynasty continues, and interest in alternative systems is developed through the exchange of goods and ideas carried out via the ports in the South China Sea, such as the Port of Guangdong. In the 19th century, the residents of Guangdong and nearby southern provinces, such as Fujian, develop interest in the United States, due to a mix of its wealth, novel system of government, and success at overthrowing its imperial overlords the British.|\n|1815||Beginning of migration||California||Migration from China to the United States begins at a very small scale, along with the opening of trade between China and the United States.

Xiong,\nformerly an aide to Zhou Enlai, had been the secretary to this\ngroup, which consisted of four marshals, senior military figures\nwho had been sent to inspect factories during the Cultural Revolution. The four marshals first focused on relations with Moscow just\nas the Sino-Soviet border clashes were breaking out; although\nthey saw the Soviets as dangerous, they doubted that Moscow intended\nto launch war against China. After Lin Biao gave a speech harshly\nattacking U.S. and Soviet imperialism, Mao asked the marshals\nto think outside the box about U.S. and Soviet policy. The four\nmarshals initially doubted that the Soviets and the Americans\nwould act against China either separately or jointly. When the\nborder fighting intensified in August 1969, marshals Chen Yi and\nYe Jianying worried about a confrontation with Moscow and proposed\nplaying the \"card of the United States.\" In a separate\nreport, Chen proposed high-level talks with the U.S. in order\nto solve basic problems in the relationship.

By 1953, as Singer notes in his article \"Robert Redfield,\" the organizers had \"decided to concentrate the Projects resources on the study of Indian civilization because of the interest and availability of anthropologists who had recently done Indian village studies.\" Participants were quick to conclude \"that while village studies can be used as points of entry for a study of Indian civilization, they were not the only available points.\" At the same time, Redfield and Singer \"sketched somewhat speculatively a conceptual framework for studying the formation and transformation of cities\" within particular civilizations, including that of India. Their jointly authored paper, \"The Cultural Role of Cities,\" offered a \"conception of a civilization as a historic structure of interacting little and great traditions,\" and provided the blueprint for a social anthropology of civilizations that would study larger civilizational systems \"from the bottom up.\" Subsequently they created a set of core courses in non-Western civilizations at Chicago and established South Asia as an area of particular interest to Chicago scholars pursuing questions of social change in a rapidly modernizing world. The towards India within the Redfield Project, as it came to be known, was given its most explicit expression in a memo from Singer to Redfield, written shortly after Singers return from his first trip to India in 1955. In it, Singer argues for committing the next five years of the Comparative Civilizations Project solely to India:\nIndia remains, in my opinion, the best place to study the interaction of little and great traditions, the social organization of tradition, \"cultural structure,\" and related problems. The coexistence of different levels of culture for a very long period of time has produced types of mutual interaction and continuity which in other civilizations can only be guessed at but which in India can be observed first-hand. During the ensuing decade, the earnest scholarship begun with Redfields Comparative Civilizations Project fostered new projects focused on South Asia. The Project had established a model of cultural study which, largely through the continuing efforts of Singer, was transmitted to the developing South Asian program at Chicago. It had emphasized study of other cultures for broadly humanistic reasons, not tied to any governmental definition of the national interest as was fashionable in the 1950s. It aimed not at producing useful expertise, but at increasing international understanding. Finally, it had stressed the study of India as a civilization, not (as most area studies did) as a geographical or political entity. The emphasis on classical traditions and cultural history still informs the Chicago program today. A Committee for South Asian Studies\nSouth Asian studies at Chicago is currently organized under six units, each contributing to the breadth of Chicagos scholarly programs. The next cases trace the development of these units: 1) the Committee on Southern Asian Studies (COSAS); 2) the South Asian Civilization teaching program in the undergraduate college; 3) the South Asian Languages and Area Center (SALAC); 4) the Department of South Asian Languages and Civilizations; 5) the South Asia library collection; and 6) the University of Chicago Press. South Asian studies at the University of Chicago was made possible by the arrival in the early 1950s of several professors who shared a deep interest in the area. India was a newly independent democracy with a long historical tradition. Many established scholars chose to pursue their particular disciplines in India when the recently-created Fulbright and Rockefeller grants began supporting research abroad. By 1954, professors at Chicago who had benefited from such grants -- including Robert Redfield, Milton Singer, Edward Shils, Richard McKeon, Bert Hoselitz, Donald Lach, Philip Hauser, Gilbert White, Francis Chase and Robert Crane -- began to meet as an informal planning committee. In 1955 that informal planning developed into the Committee on South Asian Studies (COSAS). (The name was later changed to the Committee on Southern Asian Studies, reflecting the contribution of Southeast Asian specialists to the program.) The formation of a Committee composed of faculty from different academic departments was assisted by a tradition of interdisciplinary cooperation at the University of Chicago. COSAS became an official Committee with four major aims: coordinating research activities, recommending and preparing undergraduate-level teaching materials, developing advanced programs for graduate students specializing in South Asia, and providing facilities and guidance for South Asian students.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e8f8e81c-bdf3-40dd-b783-442f42401bb0>"]},{"passage":"History 1302 Writing Assignment #1.

In a June meeting of the group, Chen and Voitinsky moved for the group to take action toward founding a Party, but many of the senior radicals who had been happy to have discussions did not think that China needed a separate Communist Party. After all, didn’t Marxism state that China needed more capitalist development to have a socialist revolution? These figures felt that a revolutionary nationalist group like the Guomindang was more appropriate to China’s situation. Clearly, these radicals drew different conclusions from the Russian experience of socialist revolution in a majority-peasant population country than Chen and Voitinsky did. So, with the efforts to constitute a local nucleus for founding a Communist Party frustrated, Chen and Voitinsky called another meeting in August, which they didn’t invite the people who didn’t want to found a Communist Party to, and there they formed a cell of about ten members who saw their task as preparing for the foundation of the Party. Chen had remained the editor of New Youth, the flagship journal of the New Culture and May 4th Movements, and beginning with its September 1920 issue, New Youth began to systematically report on events in the Soviet Union and to explain Marxism to a mass audience, in a way that had not happened before in China. The activism of the Shanghai group won Li Dazhao and the Beijing study group to become more active in organizational efforts, and to get on board with the goal of founding a party. Members of the Shanghai nucleus and from the Soviet delegation helped to start communist cells in Wuhan and Jinan, and Mao Zedong met with both the Beijing and Shanghai groups before going back to Changsha in Hunan Province to start a group there. In every case, the new communist nuclei were based on pre-existing groups of activists who had been involved in the May 4th Movement. For example, in Changsha members of the New Citizens’ Study Society that Mao participated in had been debating for some time about how to accomplish their stated goal of changing China and the world, which was admittedly vague. In the end, they decided that the model of the Bolshevik Revolution was the way that the world could be changed. Chen Duxiu moved to Guangzhou in November 1920 to take up a position as commissioner of education in the provincial government there, and it was only then that a communist nucleus was formed in that city. Chen’s move to Guangzhou right in the midst of the efforts to gather momentum to found a Communist Party points to a notable early feature of communist activism. Essentially, when Chen moved to Guangzhou, he was putting his career ahead of his revolutionary efforts. After all, Shanghai was the center of the efforts to found a communist party, and Chen had been playing a leading role in that process. All of a sudden, he put that on a back burner for a while as he put his career first. So while later on communist leaders would be expected to devote their lives to the revolution, we can see that as the movement was taking off, things were still very loose organizationally. So, how did these separate communist nuclei in cities around China go from being separate local groups that wanted to form a Communist Party to actually going ahead and forming one? What was involved in that? There were two major questions that had to be addressed, one was organizational, and the other was ideological. The principles for organizing a communist party which were followed, or at least supposed to be followed, by all the parties of the Third International had been worked out by Lenin over the long years of struggle within the Russian Social-Democratic Party between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. Lenin’s Bolsheviks advocated a much tighter, more centralized form of party organization than the Mensheviks or other Social-Democratic parties did before the Russian Revolution. Lenin’s ideas on party organization proved to be central to the success of the Russian Revolution, and so the idea was that the Communist parties of the Third International should organize themselves along the lines advocated by Lenin. Because these party principles are so different from what people in the world today typically think of when they think of a political party, I am going to review some of the main points here.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ba65aeca-cdd4-4569-9111-6285ee111989>"]}]}

We have maintained the democratic institutions that were put into place at the time of Independence, institutions that some other countries that came into existence at that time no longer possess. We have an enlarged and racially very varied, upwardly mobile middle class, necessary to maintain social stability, intellectual capital and family values. We have a sound, highly-developed energy sector, diversified and very productive; together with an expensive welfare state, but one that is vital in energy-rich countries especially when the price of gas drops. All these are important platforms upon which to build a future, and a basically optimistic society that subscribes on the whole to the concept of progress that acts as a protective mechanism to shield us from the terrors of the future.

Consisting of over seven thousand islands, islets, reefs, and cays framed by the Gulf of Mexico, North, South, and Central America, the Caribbean is one of the most revered tropical tourist destinations in the world. The region is a biodiversity hotspot, with an extensive range of rich ecosystems; many of which are vulnerable to the manifestation of the effects of climate change and other anthropogenic occurrences. Continue reading “Sustainable Tourism in the Caribbean”\nOn 26 July 1953, approximately 160 young men stormed the Moncada barracks in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba in a revolt against then dictator Fulgencio Batista. The revolt, spearheaded by a 26-year-old lawyer, Fidel Castro, did not succeed at first. However, it marked the beginning of almost six years of revolution that eventually re-shaped the political structure of Cuba and also affected the greater Caribbean region. Alongside key figures such as Che Guevara, Raúl Castro, and Camilo Cienfuegos, Castro and his revolution succeeded in ousting Batista. After the Cuban Revolution, a new era dawned in Cuba. It saw the rise of Castro, becoming both a revered and reviled leader who stood firmly against the western capitalist system, principally embodied by the United States at the time. During the height of the Cold War, Castro also opted to form close ties with the Soviet Union. Cuba loses its revolutionary leader\nContinue reading “The Caribbean Community Honours Castro”\nIn the first of this three-part series dedicated to Calypso History Month, we learned that calypso is a genre of music which has played a very important role in the processes of confrontation, revolution, and revival in the Caribbean, as well as the invention and establishment of the Caribbean identity and heritage. Secondly, we saw that, overtime, women have risen from obscurity to become strong pillars in the development and internationalisation of calypso music, allowing for greater diversity and a more holistic view of Caribbean society. Now, we look at the fluidity of calypso and the effect time has had on this genre. Continue reading “The Evolution of Calypso and Birth of Soca Music”\n“ They want to see your whole anatomy, they want to see what you doctor never see.

Brother they could keep their money, I go keep my honey, and die with my dignity!”\n– Singing Sandra, Die with My Dignity\nCalypso is an authentic Trinbagonian pastiche. It is almost impossible to imagine a true examination of cultural creation in Trinidad and Tobago that does not include calypso. If you mean to truly understand Trinbagonian, and by extension Caribbean culture beyond what may be skimmed from the top, it is important to delve into the genre. The lyrics and harmonies will create a deeper understanding of a Caribbean identity composed of quintessential variance. Likewise, calypso provides a sonic focal point for insight into the Caribbean woman’s existence. Continue reading “The Rise Of Calypso Woman”\n“…all Caribbeans know, more or less intuitively that in the final analysis, the only sure possession the undertow of history has left them is their paradoxical culture.” – Antonio Benitez Rojo\nOut of the ashes, we rise. Darkness will always make way for the dawn, and just as mother nature defies logic and shoots fresh grass from beneath concrete, the human spirit endures. Drawing on these principles, we observe the most famous musical genre coming out of the Caribbean – Calypso. The diversity of the music in the region is hinged on the influence of our enslaved ancestors as well as the external forces that impressed upon the society over time. Music plays a significant role in the construct of cultural identity. As one of the most complex forms of human cultural expressions, music epitomises a culture’s most fundamental values.\n\nIssues in Anthropology: Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean\nFrom Wikibooks, open books for an open world\nTable of Contents\nSection One: The cultural legacies of political leaders\n- Fidel Castro and his impact on US-Cuban relations\n- Che Guevara and the 26th of July Movement: An analysis of his legacy in relation to American Imperialism\n- The formation of the Nicaraguan Revolution, from Augusto Sandino to the newly re-elected Daniel Ortega: gender, land reform, military, and education.

The musical genres reggae, ska, mento, rocksteady, dub, and, more recently, dancehall and ragga all originated in the island's vibrant, popular urban recording industry. Jamaica also played an important role in the development of punk rock, through reggae. Reggae has also influenced American rap music, as they share roots as rhythmic, African styles of music. Some rappers, such as The Notorious B.I.G., Busta Rhymes, and Heavy D, are of Jamaican descent. Internationally known reggae musician Bob Marley was also Jamaican. Sport is an major part of life in Jamaica and the island's athletes tend to perform to a standard well above what might be expected of such a small country. While the most popular local sport is cricket, on the international stage Jamaicans have tended to do particularly well at track and field athletics. Jamaica has produced some of the world's most famous cricketers. The country was one of the venues of 2007 Cricket World Cup. The Jamaica national cricket team competes regionally, and also provides players for the West Indies team. Sabina Park is the only Test venue in the island, but the Greenfield Stadium is also used for cricket. Chris Gayle is the most renowned batsman from Jamaica currently representing the West Indies cricket team. Since independence Jamaica has consistently produced world class athletes in track and field. In Jamaica involvement in athletics begins at a very young age and most high schools maintain rigorous athletics programs with their top athletes competing in national competitions and international meets. In Jamaica it is not uncommon for young athletes to attain press coverage and national fame long before they arrive on the international athletics stage. Over the past six decades Jamaica has produced dozens of world class sprinters including Olympic and World Champion Usain Bolt, world record holder in the 100m for men at 9.58s, and 200m for men at 19.19s. Jamaica has several world class amateur and professional boxers. The Jamaica national bobsled team was once a serious contender in the Winter Olympics, beating many well-established teams. Chess and basketball are widely played in Jamaica and are supported by the Jamaica Chess Federation (JCF) and the Jamaica Basketball Federation (JBF). Netball is also very popular on the island, with the Jamaica national netball team called The Sunshine Girls consistently ranking in the top five in the world. Jamaica is a mixed economy with both state and private businesses. Major parts of the Jamaican economy include agriculture, mining, manufacturing, tourism, and financial and insurance services. Tourism and mining are the leading earners of foreign exchange. Half the Jamaican economy relies on services, with its income coming from services such as tourism. An estimated 1.3 million foreign tourists visit Jamaica every year. Owing to its location in the Caribbean Sea in the shipping lane to the Panama Canal Jamaica receives high container traffic. The container terminal at the Port of Kingston has undergone large expansion in capacity in recent years to handle growth. To aid the navigation of shipping, Jamaica operates nine lighthouses. Jamaica depends on petroleum imports to satisfy its national energy needs. Many test sites have been explored for oil, but none have been found. The most convenient sources of imported oil and motor fuels (diesel, gasoline, and jet fuel) are from Mexico and Venezuela. Jamaica's electrical power is produced by diesel (bunker oil) generators located in Old Harbour. Other smaller power stations support the island's electrical grid. A wind farm, owned by the Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica, was established at Wigton, Manchester. Jamaica imports approximately 80,000 barrels (13,000 m3) of oil energy products per day, including asphalt and lubrication products. Just 20% of imported fuels are used for road transportation, the rest being used by the bauxite industry, electricity generation, and aviation. 30,000 barrels\/day of crude imports are processed into various motor fuels and asphalt.

Will a Trust Help? Aug 20, 2013\nFrom Legacy Moment (08.16.2013). Please join us for future issues,\ndelivered via email each Friday. A trust? What are you trying to accomplish? To many, the holy grail of succession planning is found in the technical jargon and platitudes of some professional discipline. They think that an expert has certain credentials and hails from far away. The collective thought might be, since so much rests on legal documents, tax forms and financial matters, a person must be endowed with a special acronym to help the family plan. I think that's another form of resigning power, or to put it another way, rendering yourself powerless. Please don't ever forget, you're in charge! You control the outcome. Though a defined planning process should be followed, the plan itself must be based on your goals and help you to realize your dreams. All too often we fall victim to the aura and the charisma of a professional title. My aim is to reinforce your power and put you squarely in charge. I've been offering you the information, tools and experience you need to achieve success through the Farm Journal Legacy Project for more than four years. With that offer comes a reciprocal responsibility for action. Throughout the years, I've found people don't struggle with what is a trust [noun]; they struggle with how to trust [verb]. They don't struggle with the tax implications of a sale\/gift; they struggle with the who, how much, and when. They don't struggle with the dollars available for retirement; they struggle with when to retire and how best to prepare the next generation. Though a multidisciplinary team of professionals is necessary to help you weigh your options, select the right course of action and implement a solution, the plan must be based on your goals, not some professional's level of competence. Your professional advisers should have the right qualifications, which include (among other things) an understanding of farming, business, family, management, leadership, succession planning, legal issues, tax implications and financial matters. Though each professional on the team will not be fluent in every subject, they should be comfortable in how each works together to achieve success. It will be helpful if the advisers are at ease in a family meeting and allow a free flow of conversation. They should understand the value of setting common goals and the need to work through certain thorny yet necessary issues. Don't ever forget—it's your plan. Your future, the family and the farm depend on the decisions you make and the actions you take. News & Resources for You:\nAre you growing success? Have you pinpointed your goals?

We have an enlarged and racially very varied, upwardly mobile middle class, necessary to maintain social stability, intellectual capital and family values. We have a sound, highly-developed energy sector, diversified and very productive; together with an expensive welfare state, but one that is vital in energy-rich countries especially when the price of gas drops. All these are important platforms upon which to build a future, and a basically optimistic society that subscribes on the whole to the concept of progress that acts as a protective mechanism to shield us from the terrors of the future.

Consisting of over seven thousand islands, islets, reefs, and cays framed by the Gulf of Mexico, North, South, and Central America, the Caribbean is one of the most revered tropical tourist destinations in the world. The region is a biodiversity hotspot, with an extensive range of rich ecosystems; many of which are vulnerable to the manifestation of the effects of climate change and other anthropogenic occurrences. Continue reading “Sustainable Tourism in the Caribbean”\nOn 26 July 1953, approximately 160 young men stormed the Moncada barracks in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba in a revolt against then dictator Fulgencio Batista. The revolt, spearheaded by a 26-year-old lawyer, Fidel Castro, did not succeed at first. However, it marked the beginning of almost six years of revolution that eventually re-shaped the political structure of Cuba and also affected the greater Caribbean region. Alongside key figures such as Che Guevara, Raúl Castro, and Camilo Cienfuegos, Castro and his revolution succeeded in ousting Batista. After the Cuban Revolution, a new era dawned in Cuba. It saw the rise of Castro, becoming both a revered and reviled leader who stood firmly against the western capitalist system, principally embodied by the United States at the time. During the height of the Cold War, Castro also opted to form close ties with the Soviet Union. Cuba loses its revolutionary leader\nContinue reading “The Caribbean Community Honours Castro”\nIn the first of this three-part series dedicated to Calypso History Month, we learned that calypso is a genre of music which has played a very important role in the processes of confrontation, revolution, and revival in the Caribbean, as well as the invention and establishment of the Caribbean identity and heritage. Secondly, we saw that, overtime, women have risen from obscurity to become strong pillars in the development and internationalisation of calypso music, allowing for greater diversity and a more holistic view of Caribbean society. Now, we look at the fluidity of calypso and the effect time has had on this genre. Continue reading “The Evolution of Calypso and Birth of Soca Music”\n“ They want to see your whole anatomy, they want to see what you doctor never see. They want to do what you husband never do, still you ain’t know if these scamps will hire you. Well if is all this humiliation to get a job these days as a woman. Brother they could keep their money, I go keep my honey, and die with my dignity!”\n– Singing Sandra, Die with My Dignity\nCalypso is an authentic Trinbagonian pastiche. It is almost impossible to imagine a true examination of cultural creation in Trinidad and Tobago that does not include calypso. If you mean to truly understand Trinbagonian, and by extension Caribbean culture beyond what may be skimmed from the top, it is important to delve into the genre. The lyrics and harmonies will create a deeper understanding of a Caribbean identity composed of quintessential variance. Likewise, calypso provides a sonic focal point for insight into the Caribbean woman’s existence.

Darkness will always make way for the dawn, and just as mother nature defies logic and shoots fresh grass from beneath concrete, the human spirit endures. Drawing on these principles, we observe the most famous musical genre coming out of the Caribbean – Calypso. The diversity of the music in the region is hinged on the influence of our enslaved ancestors as well as the external forces that impressed upon the society over time. Music plays a significant role in the construct of cultural identity. As one of the most complex forms of human cultural expressions, music epitomises a culture’s most fundamental values.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:fb52a595-e6c7-4e30-9302-2db30ed28a94>"]},{"passage":"Issues in Anthropology: Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean\nFrom Wikibooks, open books for an open world\nTable of Contents\nSection One: The cultural legacies of political leaders\n- Fidel Castro and his impact on US-Cuban relations\n- Che Guevara and the 26th of July Movement: An analysis of his legacy in relation to American Imperialism\n- The formation of the Nicaraguan Revolution, from Augusto Sandino to the newly re-elected Daniel Ortega: gender, land reform, military, and education.

The musical genres reggae, ska, mento, rocksteady, dub, and, more recently, dancehall and ragga all originated in the island's vibrant, popular urban recording industry. Jamaica also played an important role in the development of punk rock, through reggae. Reggae has also influenced American rap music, as they share roots as rhythmic, African styles of music. Some rappers, such as The Notorious B.I.G., Busta Rhymes, and Heavy D, are of Jamaican descent. Internationally known reggae musician Bob Marley was also Jamaican. Sport is an major part of life in Jamaica and the island's athletes tend to perform to a standard well above what might be expected of such a small country. While the most popular local sport is cricket, on the international stage Jamaicans have tended to do particularly well at track and field athletics. Jamaica has produced some of the world's most famous cricketers. The country was one of the venues of 2007 Cricket World Cup. The Jamaica national cricket team competes regionally, and also provides players for the West Indies team. Sabina Park is the only Test venue in the island, but the Greenfield Stadium is also used for cricket. Chris Gayle is the most renowned batsman from Jamaica currently representing the West Indies cricket team. Since independence Jamaica has consistently produced world class athletes in track and field. In Jamaica involvement in athletics begins at a very young age and most high schools maintain rigorous athletics programs with their top athletes competing in national competitions and international meets. In Jamaica it is not uncommon for young athletes to attain press coverage and national fame long before they arrive on the international athletics stage. Over the past six decades Jamaica has produced dozens of world class sprinters including Olympic and World Champion Usain Bolt, world record holder in the 100m for men at 9.58s, and 200m for men at 19.19s. Jamaica has several world class amateur and professional boxers. The Jamaica national bobsled team was once a serious contender in the Winter Olympics, beating many well-established teams. Chess and basketball are widely played in Jamaica and are supported by the Jamaica Chess Federation (JCF) and the Jamaica Basketball Federation (JBF). Netball is also very popular on the island, with the Jamaica national netball team called The Sunshine Girls consistently ranking in the top five in the world. Jamaica is a mixed economy with both state and private businesses. Major parts of the Jamaican economy include agriculture, mining, manufacturing, tourism, and financial and insurance services. Tourism and mining are the leading earners of foreign exchange. Half the Jamaican economy relies on services, with its income coming from services such as tourism. An estimated 1.3 million foreign tourists visit Jamaica every year. Owing to its location in the Caribbean Sea in the shipping lane to the Panama Canal Jamaica receives high container traffic. The container terminal at the Port of Kingston has undergone large expansion in capacity in recent years to handle growth. To aid the navigation of shipping, Jamaica operates nine lighthouses. Jamaica depends on petroleum imports to satisfy its national energy needs. Many test sites have been explored for oil, but none have been found. The most convenient sources of imported oil and motor fuels (diesel, gasoline, and jet fuel) are from Mexico and Venezuela. Jamaica's electrical power is produced by diesel (bunker oil) generators located in Old Harbour. Other smaller power stations support the island's electrical grid. A wind farm, owned by the Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica, was established at Wigton, Manchester. Jamaica imports approximately 80,000 barrels (13,000 m3) of oil energy products per day, including asphalt and lubrication products. Just 20% of imported fuels are used for road transportation, the rest being used by the bauxite industry, electricity generation, and aviation. 30,000 barrels\/day of crude imports are processed into various motor fuels and asphalt.

Will a Trust Help? Aug 20, 2013\nFrom Legacy Moment (08.16.2013). Please join us for future issues,\ndelivered via email each Friday. A trust? What are you trying to accomplish? To many, the holy grail of succession planning is found in the technical jargon and platitudes of some professional discipline. They think that an expert has certain credentials and hails from far away. The collective thought might be, since so much rests on legal documents, tax forms and financial matters, a person must be endowed with a special acronym to help the family plan. I think that's another form of resigning power, or to put it another way, rendering yourself powerless. Please don't ever forget, you're in charge! You control the outcome. Though a defined planning process should be followed, the plan itself must be based on your goals and help you to realize your dreams. All too often we fall victim to the aura and the charisma of a professional title. My aim is to reinforce your power and put you squarely in charge. I've been offering you the information, tools and experience you need to achieve success through the Farm Journal Legacy Project for more than four years. With that offer comes a reciprocal responsibility for action. Throughout the years, I've found people don't struggle with what is a trust [noun]; they struggle with how to trust [verb]. They don't struggle with the tax implications of a sale\/gift; they struggle with the who, how much, and when. They don't struggle with the dollars available for retirement; they struggle with when to retire and how best to prepare the next generation. Though a multidisciplinary team of professionals is necessary to help you weigh your options, select the right course of action and implement a solution, the plan must be based on your goals, not some professional's level of competence. Your professional advisers should have the right qualifications, which include (among other things) an understanding of farming, business, family, management, leadership, succession planning, legal issues, tax implications and financial matters. Though each professional on the team will not be fluent in every subject, they should be comfortable in how each works together to achieve success. It will be helpful if the advisers are at ease in a family meeting and allow a free flow of conversation. They should understand the value of setting common goals and the need to work through certain thorny yet necessary issues. Don't ever forget—it's your plan.

Bipolar affects approximately 2.6% of the adult population in the United States. Although bipolar symptoms can emerge at any time, the typical age of onset is between 18 and 25. Bipolar affects men and women equally. There are some factors that increase the risk of bipolar including: The manic phase may last one week or more and is characterized by increased energy and an elevated or irritable mood that is present for most of the day. Diagnosis requires the presence of three or more of these symptoms: Symptoms of hypomanic episodes are similar, but tend to be shorter in duration, lasting four days or more. Psychotic symptoms are not present during hypomanic episodes, and the symptoms are not so severe as to require hospitalization. Hypomanic symptoms are common among all the bipolar diagnoses, but manic episodes are symptomatic solely of bipolar I. The depressive phase of bipolar includes at least five symptoms of major depression that last for at least two weeks, including: While bipolar cannot be cured, it can be managed effectively. Psychotherapy can help people with bipolar by teaching them how to recognize triggers so they can understand or possibly avoid them, decrease negatively expressed emotions, and practice healthy coping skills. Finding a therapist or counselor with whom you can establish a healthy therapeutic relationship may help develop some of the following skills for managing bipolar: Some types of psychotherapy such as family-focused and dialectable therapies are effective in preventing relapses. Although the research clearly demonstrates that bipolar often has an organic ideology, psychotherapy has been proven to be an effective treatment. Medication is also commonly used in the treatment of bipolar. Another myth about bipolar is that it is only caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. While there is an organic component to it, bipolar is typically influenced by a variety of factors including environment and experience. Finally, it is a myth that people with bipolar cannot lead a normal life. Bipolar can be effectively managed with treatment, and many people with bipolar experience long periods of remission.

To which I’m asking but what creates that chemical unbalance in the first place? If meditation has been proven to alter the brain and body chemicals, could pain and depression alter those chemicals as well rather than this chemical unbalance creating depression? Therefore, what would happen if we started to treat the depression in the first place? I’ve been working with my client for a few months now, and guess what: she’s now very happy, balanced, her self-esteem and self-worth have improved, and now that with the help of Hypnotherapy, NLP and EFT we’ve removed the underlying root cause that was behind her initial depression, she’s been consistently completely fine. And I suspect it’s going to last. I don’t deny that in some cases there is actually a physical reason behind the issue, but I also believe it happens much less often than officially diagnosed – like clinical depression. If there are genuine cases of clinical depression, a large part of the given diagnostics are misinformed, and a lot of the time what those people really need instead of quick-fix drugs is the support of a therapist that offers unconditional love and positive regard. I’ve seen it in my practice many times and definitively intend to keep working in that direction. So if you’ve been diagnosed with depression or bipolar disorder, before taking it for granted, please do some research and question the diagnostic.

However, the exact causes of the condition - the things that set it in motion - are not definitively understood at this time. Possible causes being researched include a malfunctioning neurotransmitter (chemical pathway in the brain), a hormonal cause, an infectious agent (bacteria or virus), or an elevated antibody.

The fact that bipolar disorders can typically be controlled by medication strongly suggests that they result from biochemical imbalances.

Although it is thought that bipolar disorders are the result of the body's chemical disturbances, there is no biological diagnostic test to reliably identify the condition.

A colleague of mine in the US heard that her grandson had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital. As a long-standing critic of the psychiatric system she was concerned for his welfare and went to see him. She discovered that in the first few days he had been drugged into a stupor and she insisted on seeing the medical staff. Three psychiatrists told her that, sadly, her grandson had a bipolar disorder caused by a brain bio-chemical imbalance. Quietly, but firmly, she asked what evidence they had there was something wrong with his brain. They said that his mood and behaviour indicated a serious problem. She asked how they knew this problem was caused by brain biochemistry. Slightly uncomfortable, they vaguely referred to studies that indicated that this was the case. Much more confident now, my colleague responded that she knew of no studies that had ever confirmed this idea even though it is a common assumption in the psychiatric world. For good measure she quoted some studies that indicated that there was nothing wrong with the brains of people with all sorts of psychiatric labels. Sensing that they were dealing with someone who might actually have read the literature they asked what she wanted. Her grandson was quickly transferred to a unit offering talking therapies. My colleague didn’t ask the question that all patients, relatives and advocates should ask when confronted with the claim that a brain biochemical problem lies at the root of someone’s low mood or strange behaviour. She could have said, \"Can I see the test results, please?\" The truth is that, unlike all other branches of medicine, psychiatrists do not do physical tests on people to confirm their diagnoses. The reason is simple: there is nothing wrong with the brains of people diagnosed schizophrenic, bi-polar, depressed and so on. The organic hypothesis remains just that; an unproven hypothesis. Claims continue to be made in the scientific literature and popular press. David Cohen, another US activist, has noted that almost all the substances operating within the human body have been investigated as a possible cause of schizophrenia. This research is leaked to the press before it has been accepted in a peer-reviewed journal and \"the results are likely to be cited around the world, thought they may never make it to scientific publication\". We are also well aware of the massive conflicts of interest involved in the studies that do finally appear in the official literature. Effective Health Care, in reviewing the newest so-called anti-psychotic medication concluded, \"Most relevant trials are undertaken by those with clear pecuniary interest in the results\"1. There is no validity in psychiatric diagnosis2,3. Even if there were, after almost two hundred years, we have never found anything at all wrong with the brain biochemistry of people diagnosed with a host of so-called disorders. Some, conditions, for example, Alcohol-induced dementia do indeed show real signs of brain damage. This is rare. The studies on all the main diagnostic categories of psychiatry, however, are plagued by a significant problem: the people being tested have almost always already received psychotropic medication. In other words, if there is a blood, brain or liver disorder, this may well have been caused by the drugs, or ECT. Physical tests on people diagnosed, but not yet treated, by psychiatrists, would be the only way to find out if there really were a difference between these people and the general public. This never happens as most people first encounter a GP who, instead of asking for blood and other tests to demonstrate a psychiatric condition, simply prescribe a psychotropic drug or refer on to a psychiatrist. Imagine the same situation in oncology. You are told that you look like you have cancer. There are no tests offered to you. You are told you will have two operations, followed by radiotherapy and a course of drugs that makes your hair fall out. The idea is preposterous. You demand proof of your condition. An x-ray, a CT scan and blood and liver tests reveal that the diagnosis was accurate. Reassured, though still very scared you agree to the treatment. Psychiatrists of course do ask for tests like CT scans on their patients but these are to exclude the possibility of organic damage. In other words, they are checking to see if there is a real brain problem, evidence of illegal drug-use or whatever.\n\nHave you ever stopped to think about how the mental health stigma doesn’t make sense? So many of us walk around feeling ashamed of our struggles, trying to hide them from the rest of the world. Yet functioning with these immense internal difficulties actually evinces our strength! As actress Carrie Fisher wrote in Wishful Drinking:\n“Being bipolar can be an all-consuming challenge, requiring a lot of stamina and even more courage, so if you’re living with this illness and functioning at all, it’s something to be proud of, not ashamed of.”\nPlus, try this statistic on for size: according to the CDC, nearly 50% of U.S. adults will struggle with at least one mental illness in their lifetime. In this post, we’ll focus on the dual diagnosis of addiction and bipolar disorder. What Is Bipolar Disorder? Bipolar is a mood disorder characterized by emotional swings from high to low. People with bipolar deal with depressive “down” phases and manic “up” phases, and they struggle to find a healthy middle ground. In a depressive state, a person might be immobilized, unable to take care of their usual responsibilities. But in a manic state, that same person might work around the clock. One quick definition for bipolar is “experiencing extremes”. This disorder does have a genetic component, but an individual’s environment matters a great deal as well. Growing up in a physically, mentally, or emotionally traumatic environment is a strong risk factor. Why an Accurate Diagnosis Can Be Difficult\nHere are a few key reasons why bipolar disorder can be difficult to diagnose accurately:\nFirst, if a person is under the influence, it’s extremely challenging to provide an accurate diagnosis. Having people detox prior to diagnosis is ideal. Next, the bipolar label has increased in popularity in recent years. This is great for awareness, but it can also lead to misdiagnosis. For example, sometimes people who are dealing with clinical depression are misdiagnosed with bipolar because of the dramatic difference between their low-functioning depressive state and their usual functioning state. Similarly, rigid, black-and-white thinking can be confused with bipolar symptoms, and so can the aftereffects of trauma. Finally, when people have a great deal of conflict in their lives, they may be labeled as bipolar. But when they gain the tools they need to resolve those conflicts, often the level of internal tension changes significantly. In short, understanding bipolar disorder and addiction is critical for accurate diagnosis and treatment. True bipolar disorder involves an imbalance in brain chemistry, and it’s certainly a serious condition. Yet in our experience in running a residential addiction treatment center, we see people misdiagnosed as bipolar when in reality they have mental and emotional issues causing a lot of upset in their lives. That’s not brain chemistry; that’s just upset. We find that when such people heal those issues, the upset in their lives decreases dramatically. The Connection Between Addiction and Bipolar Disorder\nBipolar disorder is part of a family of mood disorders, including depression, anxiety, and seasonal affective disorder (SAD). While mood disorders can be caused or exacerbated by drug use, more often people with mood disorders use addictive substances to self-medicate. Many people with bipolar turn to substances during their depressive states. There is a particularly strong connection between bipolar and addiction. Statistics from DualDiagnosis.org suggest that 56% of people with bipolar disorder have experienced drug addiction. Healing from Bipolar and Addiction\nSeptember is National Recovery Month, and it’s also Self Awareness Month. This is fitting, as you can’t really have one without the other. Self awareness is an essential component of recovery, especially when you’re dealing with a dual diagnosis. That said, medication certainly has its place as well. If you find that you continue to struggle with emotional extremes after you’ve detoxed from substances, then medication may give you the support you need to maintain emotional stability. However, don’t shortchange yourself by skipping over the mental and emotional issues that contribute to mood disorders. Finding and addressing the root causes of physical disorders can minimize (or eliminate!) the need for medications to treat symptoms, and the same is true for emotional disorders. What Counseling Strategies Work Well with Bipolar?\n\nSomeone that qualifies as being in a state of rapid-cycling experiences four or more episodes of mania or depression within a given year. This manifested form of BPD may come and go over time and can occur at any point throughout the disorder. Types Of Bipolar Disorder\nAlthough bipolar is known to present itself in many different ways, there are four main types of BPD that are each characterized by a unique set of symptoms: Bipolar I, Bipolar II, Cyclothymia, and Other or Unspecified Bipolar. Bipolar I is seen as the most classic form of the manic-depressive disorder, in that a person will experience at least one mixed or manic episode. The manic episodes typically last at least 7 days, and some symptoms can be so severe that the person may need to be hospitalized. Mixed episodes where both hypomanic and depressive symptoms are present is a common feature of bipolar I. Although not in all cases, bipolar I usually involves at least one depressive episode, lasting about 2 weeks. Bipolar II is characterized by a pattern of depressive and hypomanic episodes, but full-blown manic episodes are not experienced. Cyclothymia is defined by cyclical mood swings that occur on a fairly regular basis. The symptoms of hypomania and depression in this type of BPD are typically less severe in form but can still have a serious negative impact on a person’s life. Cyclothymia can also progress into full-fledged manic or depressive episodes. Causes And Triggers Of Bipolar Disorder\nThere is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the cause of bipolar disorder, but scientific research suggests that the onset of these mood disorders likely results from a multitude of factors and the interactions that occur between them. Bipolar disorder is known to run in families, but genes are not the only thing at play here. While some inherit a genetic vulnerability to the disorder, many with the same genetic predisposition never develop the illness. This alone shows that there are other factors aside from genes that are responsible. Environmental factors, such as stress or loss can act as triggers creating new episodes or exacerbating existing symptoms. Sleep deprivation and substance abuse are also known to trigger and exacerbate symptoms of BPD. The variations in severity coupled with the interplay of biological, genetic, psychological, and psychosocial elements are what cause these disorders to be so complex, and therefore difficult to treat, especially when substance abuse and bipolar disorder are combined. Subjective reports indicate that marijuana use is intended mostly to relieve the positive symptoms of the schizophrenic condition. People with this mental illness may use cannabis to relieve the psychological strain caused by delusion or hallucination; or “chill them out” and relieve the effects of physical or verbal agitation. The Brain And Bipolar Disorder\nGiven its vast complexity, our understanding for the brain’s interworking mechanisms remains quite limited. New theories about communicative neural processes arise as science continues to progress—keeping the field of abnormal psychology and the way we treat mental health disorders always changing. In cases of bipolar disorder, it’s pretty clear that emotion seems to overtake behavior, but new research has given us a glimpse into the processes and mechanisms by which this happens: the brain’s emotional centers are exhibiting too much activity, whereas the judgment and impulse control centers (located in the frontal lobes) exhibit too little. This has led experts to believe that much of bipolar disorder’s underlying cause resides in the circuitry of the brain that contributes to our overall functionality. Brain chemicals called neurotransmitters serve as the messengers within these circuits; they travel through our brain’s neural pathways to allow different parts (or “hubs”) to communicate with one another. Neurotransmitter imbalances disrupt and alter the communicative routs between brain cells, causing impairment to processes such as mood regulation upon which we rely and ultimately the attributes that make us who we are. The three key neurotransmitters responsible for brain and bodily function, noradrenaline (norepinephrine), serotonin, and dopamine, are believed to play an important role in the onset of BPD.\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two genes that influence the activity of nerve cells in the brain may play a key role in a person's risk for bipolar disorder, marked by dramatic swings from depression to manic behavior, researchers said on Sunday. The findings are not expected to lead to a genetic test for the risk of the condition but could help unravel the mystery of how it arises and lead to better treatments, they reported in the journal Nature Genetics. An international team of scientists examined the genomes of 10,596 people mainly from Britain and the United States, including 4,387 with bipolar disorder, also sometimes known as manic-depression. The researchers found those with bipolar disorder more likely to have certain variants of the ANK3 and CACNA1C genes. Proteins made by the two genes help govern the flow of sodium and calcium ions into and out of neurons in the brain, influencing the activity of these nerve cells. \"The key importance of this is that it gives us a clear idea of the sorts of chemicals and mechanisms in the brain that are involved in bipolar disorder,\" Nick Craddock of Britain's Cardiff University, who helped lead the study, said in a telephone interview. \"Over a number of years, that will help researchers to develop better approaches to diagnosis and treatment.\" Because it tends to run in families, scientists have been trying to pinpoint genes involved in bipolar disorder. This was the largest genetic analysis of its kind on the disease, which affects an estimated 1 percent to 3 percent of adults worldwide, Craddock said. The brain disorder causes extreme shifts in mood, energy and ability to function. It is marked by high periods of elation or irritability and low periods of sadness and hopelessness that can last months. The proper function of brain neurons depends on a delicate equilibrium between sodium and calcium, the researchers said. \"The brain operates according to how quickly calcium and sodium are going in and out of cells and how much of it goes in and out,\" Craddock said. The findings suggest that bipolar disorder may stem at least in part from malfunctions in the flow of these ions, which are electrically charged versions of the chemicals. There is a need for better treatment, Craddock said. Lithium, the most common, helps only about two-thirds of those with the disorder and can cause drowsiness, weight gain and mild shakiness. The U.S. government's National Institutes of Health helped fund the research. Dr. Thomas Insel, director of the NIH's National Institute of Mental Health, said the findings may help solve the puzzle that is bipolar disorder. \"It's not going to tell us the whole story -- it doesn't give you the whole puzzle -- but it's something to build on,\" Insel said in a telephone interview. Craddock said identifying the two gene variants probably will not be helpful in determining an individual's risk for the disorder because many who do not have the disease will have the genes.\n\nWhat Are the Causes? Bipolar disorder results from a chemical imbalance in the brain as a result of multiple causes that vary between individuals. Studies conclusively show that genetics and environmental factors both play a part in causing symptoms. Certain genes are linked to bipolar disorder. Most research has not been conclusive, but findings have found potential causes in the genes related to serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, and cell growth. No studies report findings with 100 percent confidence. Many childhood behaviors and habits have been linked to people who develop bipolar disorder as adults or adolescence. There is a strong correlation between depression, mood abnormalities, ADHD, and stimulant use. Certain environmental components can lead to bipolar disorder. Traumatic events and social relationships are factors that can affect whether a person will be diagnosed as bipolar. Many children who experience abuse and posttraumatic stress disorder have a chance of developing bipolar disorder later on. Some studies have shown that sensitivity to melatonin is an indicator of bipolar disorder. In the sample groups, individuals with bipolar disorder demonstrated sensitivity to light, causing an extreme drop in melatonin. In corresponding studies, the recovered bipolar patients showed no sensitivity to light. Certain psychological functions have a role in triggering bipolar disorder. Extreme stress can cause people to experience extreme fluctuations in mood. A person might start to feel critical, depressed, and impulsive. Slowly, a person will bipolar disorder may start to lose self control and behave irrationally. Who's at Risk? Bipolar disorder affects men and women of all ages. Most bipolar patients are diagnosed by the time they are adolescents; however, a person of any age can develop symptoms for the first time. Children can also show signs of bipolar disorder. It is believed that heredity plays a role in bipolar disorder since people with a family history of the condition are likely to have the condition, themselves. People develop symptoms for a variety of reasons that are both genetic and environmental. It is difficult to tell who will develop bipolar disorder and who will not. If you notice that you experience extreme mood swings, you may be bipolar. Do not take your symptoms lightly, especially if you notice ups and downs over an extended period of time. There are many stereotypes about people who are bipolar, and as a result, people might be afraid to talk about their symptoms. Understand that a large group of people are equally at risk. You should not feel ashamed, especially when there are effective treatments available.\n\nBipolar disorder is one of the most difficult mental illnesses to diagnose and treat because of its complicated shifts between different symptoms. At the present time there is no cure for bipolar disorder but strategies such as medication and cognitive behavioral therapy to help minimize symptoms and manage the illness. However some researchers are looking for different methods that could use a more holistic approach to treating the disorder in the future. Mental illness often are closely related to issues in the brain that lead to certain mood problems and various behaviors. Medications are meant to help balance out chemicals in the brain that may be causing certain symptoms. However, researchers believe that helping to restore nerve cell health in the brain for better communication may go a long way to treat issues like bipolar disorder. In the past it was believed that bipolar disorder was caused by an imbalance of chemicals like serotonin or dopamine which led to depressed or elevated moods. Researchers now believe that neural plasticity may play a more important role in alleviated the symptoms of mania and depression. People with bipolar disorder tend to have atrophy of neurons in certain brain areas but improving nerve cells in these areas could potentially change the path of the disorder. Medications like lithium which are used in treating bipolar disorder were recently discovered to actually boost levels of proteins that help neurons maintain their function. This may explain why lithium has been shown to be effective as a long term treatment. Using other methods to improve the health of neurons in the brain may create a more focused and efficient way to reduce symptoms quickly. Although more research needs to be done to determine long term results, nerve and brain health may be the focus of bipolar treatment in the future.\n\nBipolar Disorder (cont.) In this Article\nWhat are the risk factors for bipolar disorder? Scientists are learning about the possible causes of bipolar disorder. Most scientists agree that there is no single cause. Rather, many factors likely act together to produce the illness or increase risk. Bipolar disorder tends to run in families, so researchers are looking for genes that may increase a person's chance of developing the illness. Genes are the \"building blocks\" of heredity. They help control how the body and brain work and grow. Genes are contained inside a person's cells that are passed down from parents to children. Children with a parent or sibling who has bipolar disorder are four to six times more likely to develop the illness, compared with children who do not have a family history of bipolar disorder. However, most children with a family history of bipolar disorder will not develop the illness. Genetic research on bipolar disorder is being helped by advances in technology. This type of research is now much quicker and more far-reaching than in the past. One example is the launch of the Bipolar Disorder Phenome Database, funded in part by NIMH. Using the database, scientists will be able to link visible signs of the disorder with the genes that may influence them. So far, researchers using this database found that most people with bipolar disorder had:\nThe researchers also identified certain traits that appeared to run in families, including:\nScientists continue to study these traits, which may help them find the genes that cause bipolar disorder some day. But genes are not the only risk factor for bipolar disorder. Studies of identical twins have shown that the twin of a person with bipolar illness does not always develop the disorder. This is important because identical twins share all of the same genes. The study results suggest factors besides genes are also at work. Rather, it is likely that many different genes and a person's environment are involved. However, scientists do not yet fully understand how these factors interact to cause bipolar disorder. Brain structure and functioning\nBrain-imaging studies are helping scientists learn what happens in the brain of a person with bipolar disorder. Newer brain-imaging tools, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), allow researchers to take pictures of the living brain at work. These tools help scientists study the brain's structure and activity. Some imaging studies show how the brains of people with bipolar disorder may differ from the brains of healthy people or people with other mental disorders. For example, one study using MRI found that the pattern of brain development in children with bipolar disorder was similar to that in children with \"multi-dimensional impairment,\" a disorder that causes symptoms that overlap somewhat with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. This suggests that the common pattern of brain development may be linked to general risk for unstable moods. Learning more about these differences, along with information gained from genetic studies, helps scientists better understand bipolar disorder. Someday scientists may be able to predict which types of treatment will work most effectively. They may even find ways to prevent bipolar disorder. How is bipolar disorder diagnosed? The first step in getting a proper diagnosis is to talk to a doctor, who may conduct a physical examination, an interview, and lab tests. Bipolar disorder cannot currently be identified through a blood test or a brain scan, but these tests can help rule out other contributing factors, such as a stroke or brain tumor. If the problems are not caused by other illnesses, the doctor may conduct a mental health evaluation. The doctor may also provide a referral to a trained mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist, who is experienced in diagnosing and treating bipolar disorder. The doctor or mental health professional should conduct a complete diagnostic evaluation. He or she should discuss any family history of bipolar disorder or other mental illnesses and get a complete history of symptoms. The doctor or mental health professionals should also talk to the person's close relatives or spouse and note how they describe the person's symptoms and family medical history. People with bipolar disorder are more likely to seek help when they are depressed than when experiencing mania or hypomania. Therefore, a careful medical history is needed to assure that bipolar disorder is not mistakenly diagnosed as major depressive disorder, which is also called unipolar depression.","passages":[{"passage":"Of course you can argue that bipolar disorder is actually caused by a chemical unbalance in the brain.

David Cohen, another US activist, has noted that almost all the substances operating within the human body have been investigated as a possible cause of schizophrenia. This research is leaked to the press before it has been accepted in a peer-reviewed journal and \"the results are likely to be cited around the world, thought they may never make it to scientific publication\". We are also well aware of the massive conflicts of interest involved in the studies that do finally appear in the official literature. Effective Health Care, in reviewing the newest so-called anti-psychotic medication concluded, \"Most relevant trials are undertaken by those with clear pecuniary interest in the results\"1. There is no validity in psychiatric diagnosis2,3. Even if there were, after almost two hundred years, we have never found anything at all wrong with the brain biochemistry of people diagnosed with a host of so-called disorders. Some, conditions, for example, Alcohol-induced dementia do indeed show real signs of brain damage. This is rare. The studies on all the main diagnostic categories of psychiatry, however, are plagued by a significant problem: the people being tested have almost always already received psychotropic medication. In other words, if there is a blood, brain or liver disorder, this may well have been caused by the drugs, or ECT. Physical tests on people diagnosed, but not yet treated, by psychiatrists, would be the only way to find out if there really were a difference between these people and the general public. This never happens as most people first encounter a GP who, instead of asking for blood and other tests to demonstrate a psychiatric condition, simply prescribe a psychotropic drug or refer on to a psychiatrist. Imagine the same situation in oncology. You are told that you look like you have cancer. There are no tests offered to you. You are told you will have two operations, followed by radiotherapy and a course of drugs that makes your hair fall out. The idea is preposterous. You demand proof of your condition. An x-ray, a CT scan and blood and liver tests reveal that the diagnosis was accurate. Reassured, though still very scared you agree to the treatment. Psychiatrists of course do ask for tests like CT scans on their patients but these are to exclude the possibility of organic damage. In other words, they are checking to see if there is a real brain problem, evidence of illegal drug-use or whatever.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:b122e79e-187d-4e58-bfa1-2f2d3c4a1023>"]},{"passage":"Have you ever stopped to think about how the mental health stigma doesn’t make sense? So many of us walk around feeling ashamed of our struggles, trying to hide them from the rest of the world. Yet functioning with these immense internal difficulties actually evinces our strength! As actress Carrie Fisher wrote in Wishful Drinking:\n“Being bipolar can be an all-consuming challenge, requiring a lot of stamina and even more courage, so if you’re living with this illness and functioning at all, it’s something to be proud of, not ashamed of.”\nPlus, try this statistic on for size: according to the CDC, nearly 50% of U.S. adults will struggle with at least one mental illness in their lifetime. In this post, we’ll focus on the dual diagnosis of addiction and bipolar disorder. What Is Bipolar Disorder? Bipolar is a mood disorder characterized by emotional swings from high to low. People with bipolar deal with depressive “down” phases and manic “up” phases, and they struggle to find a healthy middle ground. In a depressive state, a person might be immobilized, unable to take care of their usual responsibilities. But in a manic state, that same person might work around the clock. One quick definition for bipolar is “experiencing extremes”. This disorder does have a genetic component, but an individual’s environment matters a great deal as well. Growing up in a physically, mentally, or emotionally traumatic environment is a strong risk factor. Why an Accurate Diagnosis Can Be Difficult\nHere are a few key reasons why bipolar disorder can be difficult to diagnose accurately:\nFirst, if a person is under the influence, it’s extremely challenging to provide an accurate diagnosis. Having people detox prior to diagnosis is ideal. Next, the bipolar label has increased in popularity in recent years. This is great for awareness, but it can also lead to misdiagnosis. For example, sometimes people who are dealing with clinical depression are misdiagnosed with bipolar because of the dramatic difference between their low-functioning depressive state and their usual functioning state. Similarly, rigid, black-and-white thinking can be confused with bipolar symptoms, and so can the aftereffects of trauma. Finally, when people have a great deal of conflict in their lives, they may be labeled as bipolar. But when they gain the tools they need to resolve those conflicts, often the level of internal tension changes significantly. In short, understanding bipolar disorder and addiction is critical for accurate diagnosis and treatment. True bipolar disorder involves an imbalance in brain chemistry, and it’s certainly a serious condition. Yet in our experience in running a residential addiction treatment center, we see people misdiagnosed as bipolar when in reality they have mental and emotional issues causing a lot of upset in their lives. That’s not brain chemistry; that’s just upset. We find that when such people heal those issues, the upset in their lives decreases dramatically. The Connection Between Addiction and Bipolar Disorder\nBipolar disorder is part of a family of mood disorders, including depression, anxiety, and seasonal affective disorder (SAD). While mood disorders can be caused or exacerbated by drug use, more often people with mood disorders use addictive substances to self-medicate. Many people with bipolar turn to substances during their depressive states. There is a particularly strong connection between bipolar and addiction. Statistics from DualDiagnosis.org suggest that 56% of people with bipolar disorder have experienced drug addiction. Healing from Bipolar and Addiction\nSeptember is National Recovery Month, and it’s also Self Awareness Month. This is fitting, as you can’t really have one without the other. Self awareness is an essential component of recovery, especially when you’re dealing with a dual diagnosis. That said, medication certainly has its place as well. If you find that you continue to struggle with emotional extremes after you’ve detoxed from substances, then medication may give you the support you need to maintain emotional stability. However, don’t shortchange yourself by skipping over the mental and emotional issues that contribute to mood disorders. Finding and addressing the root causes of physical disorders can minimize (or eliminate!) the need for medications to treat symptoms, and the same is true for emotional disorders.

This manifested form of BPD may come and go over time and can occur at any point throughout the disorder. Types Of Bipolar Disorder\nAlthough bipolar is known to present itself in many different ways, there are four main types of BPD that are each characterized by a unique set of symptoms: Bipolar I, Bipolar II, Cyclothymia, and Other or Unspecified Bipolar. Bipolar I is seen as the most classic form of the manic-depressive disorder, in that a person will experience at least one mixed or manic episode. The manic episodes typically last at least 7 days, and some symptoms can be so severe that the person may need to be hospitalized. Mixed episodes where both hypomanic and depressive symptoms are present is a common feature of bipolar I. Although not in all cases, bipolar I usually involves at least one depressive episode, lasting about 2 weeks. Bipolar II is characterized by a pattern of depressive and hypomanic episodes, but full-blown manic episodes are not experienced. Cyclothymia is defined by cyclical mood swings that occur on a fairly regular basis. The symptoms of hypomania and depression in this type of BPD are typically less severe in form but can still have a serious negative impact on a person’s life. Cyclothymia can also progress into full-fledged manic or depressive episodes. Causes And Triggers Of Bipolar Disorder\nThere is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the cause of bipolar disorder, but scientific research suggests that the onset of these mood disorders likely results from a multitude of factors and the interactions that occur between them. Bipolar disorder is known to run in families, but genes are not the only thing at play here. While some inherit a genetic vulnerability to the disorder, many with the same genetic predisposition never develop the illness. This alone shows that there are other factors aside from genes that are responsible. Environmental factors, such as stress or loss can act as triggers creating new episodes or exacerbating existing symptoms. Sleep deprivation and substance abuse are also known to trigger and exacerbate symptoms of BPD. The variations in severity coupled with the interplay of biological, genetic, psychological, and psychosocial elements are what cause these disorders to be so complex, and therefore difficult to treat, especially when substance abuse and bipolar disorder are combined. Subjective reports indicate that marijuana use is intended mostly to relieve the positive symptoms of the schizophrenic condition. People with this mental illness may use cannabis to relieve the psychological strain caused by delusion or hallucination; or “chill them out” and relieve the effects of physical or verbal agitation. The Brain And Bipolar Disorder\nGiven its vast complexity, our understanding for the brain’s interworking mechanisms remains quite limited. New theories about communicative neural processes arise as science continues to progress—keeping the field of abnormal psychology and the way we treat mental health disorders always changing. In cases of bipolar disorder, it’s pretty clear that emotion seems to overtake behavior, but new research has given us a glimpse into the processes and mechanisms by which this happens: the brain’s emotional centers are exhibiting too much activity, whereas the judgment and impulse control centers (located in the frontal lobes) exhibit too little. This has led experts to believe that much of bipolar disorder’s underlying cause resides in the circuitry of the brain that contributes to our overall functionality. Brain chemicals called neurotransmitters serve as the messengers within these circuits; they travel through our brain’s neural pathways to allow different parts (or “hubs”) to communicate with one another. Neurotransmitter imbalances disrupt and alter the communicative routs between brain cells, causing impairment to processes such as mood regulation upon which we rely and ultimately the attributes that make us who we are. The three key neurotransmitters responsible for brain and bodily function, noradrenaline (norepinephrine), serotonin, and dopamine, are believed to play an important role in the onset of BPD.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:1d2d8a66-50a6-4fd5-8dde-c4d65c7a4573>"]},{"passage":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two genes that influence the activity of nerve cells in the brain may play a key role in a person's risk for bipolar disorder, marked by dramatic swings from depression to manic behavior, researchers said on Sunday. The findings are not expected to lead to a genetic test for the risk of the condition but could help unravel the mystery of how it arises and lead to better treatments, they reported in the journal Nature Genetics. An international team of scientists examined the genomes of 10,596 people mainly from Britain and the United States, including 4,387 with bipolar disorder, also sometimes known as manic-depression. The researchers found those with bipolar disorder more likely to have certain variants of the ANK3 and CACNA1C genes. Proteins made by the two genes help govern the flow of sodium and calcium ions into and out of neurons in the brain, influencing the activity of these nerve cells. \"The key importance of this is that it gives us a clear idea of the sorts of chemicals and mechanisms in the brain that are involved in bipolar disorder,\" Nick Craddock of Britain's Cardiff University, who helped lead the study, said in a telephone interview. \"Over a number of years, that will help researchers to develop better approaches to diagnosis and treatment.\" Because it tends to run in families, scientists have been trying to pinpoint genes involved in bipolar disorder. This was the largest genetic analysis of its kind on the disease, which affects an estimated 1 percent to 3 percent of adults worldwide, Craddock said. The brain disorder causes extreme shifts in mood, energy and ability to function. It is marked by high periods of elation or irritability and low periods of sadness and hopelessness that can last months. The proper function of brain neurons depends on a delicate equilibrium between sodium and calcium, the researchers said. \"The brain operates according to how quickly calcium and sodium are going in and out of cells and how much of it goes in and out,\" Craddock said. The findings suggest that bipolar disorder may stem at least in part from malfunctions in the flow of these ions, which are electrically charged versions of the chemicals. There is a need for better treatment, Craddock said. Lithium, the most common, helps only about two-thirds of those with the disorder and can cause drowsiness, weight gain and mild shakiness. The U.S. government's National Institutes of Health helped fund the research. Dr. Thomas Insel, director of the NIH's National Institute of Mental Health, said the findings may help solve the puzzle that is bipolar disorder. \"It's not going to tell us the whole story -- it doesn't give you the whole puzzle -- but it's something to build on,\" Insel said in a telephone interview. Craddock said identifying the two gene variants probably will not be helpful in determining an individual's risk for the disorder because many who do not have the disease will have the genes.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:5ae6729d-06bc-4f01-bc7b-0b81db567919>"]},{"passage":"What Are the Causes? Bipolar disorder results from a chemical imbalance in the brain as a result of multiple causes that vary between individuals. Studies conclusively show that genetics and environmental factors both play a part in causing symptoms. Certain genes are linked to bipolar disorder. Most research has not been conclusive, but findings have found potential causes in the genes related to serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, and cell growth. No studies report findings with 100 percent confidence. Many childhood behaviors and habits have been linked to people who develop bipolar disorder as adults or adolescence. There is a strong correlation between depression, mood abnormalities, ADHD, and stimulant use. Certain environmental components can lead to bipolar disorder. Traumatic events and social relationships are factors that can affect whether a person will be diagnosed as bipolar. Many children who experience abuse and posttraumatic stress disorder have a chance of developing bipolar disorder later on. Some studies have shown that sensitivity to melatonin is an indicator of bipolar disorder. In the sample groups, individuals with bipolar disorder demonstrated sensitivity to light, causing an extreme drop in melatonin. In corresponding studies, the recovered bipolar patients showed no sensitivity to light. Certain psychological functions have a role in triggering bipolar disorder. Extreme stress can cause people to experience extreme fluctuations in mood. A person might start to feel critical, depressed, and impulsive. Slowly, a person will bipolar disorder may start to lose self control and behave irrationally. Who's at Risk? Bipolar disorder affects men and women of all ages. Most bipolar patients are diagnosed by the time they are adolescents; however, a person of any age can develop symptoms for the first time. Children can also show signs of bipolar disorder. It is believed that heredity plays a role in bipolar disorder since people with a family history of the condition are likely to have the condition, themselves. People develop symptoms for a variety of reasons that are both genetic and environmental. It is difficult to tell who will develop bipolar disorder and who will not. If you notice that you experience extreme mood swings, you may be bipolar. Do not take your symptoms lightly, especially if you notice ups and downs over an extended period of time. There are many stereotypes about people who are bipolar, and as a result, people might be afraid to talk about their symptoms. Understand that a large group of people are equally at risk. You should not feel ashamed, especially when there are effective treatments available.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:44eeb63a-5c5a-4cf3-a8c0-1c08d24e53d5>"]},{"passage":"Bipolar disorder is one of the most difficult mental illnesses to diagnose and treat because of its complicated shifts between different symptoms. At the present time there is no cure for bipolar disorder but strategies such as medication and cognitive behavioral therapy to help minimize symptoms and manage the illness. However some researchers are looking for different methods that could use a more holistic approach to treating the disorder in the future. Mental illness often are closely related to issues in the brain that lead to certain mood problems and various behaviors. Medications are meant to help balance out chemicals in the brain that may be causing certain symptoms. However, researchers believe that helping to restore nerve cell health in the brain for better communication may go a long way to treat issues like bipolar disorder. In the past it was believed that bipolar disorder was caused by an imbalance of chemicals like serotonin or dopamine which led to depressed or elevated moods. Researchers now believe that neural plasticity may play a more important role in alleviated the symptoms of mania and depression. People with bipolar disorder tend to have atrophy of neurons in certain brain areas but improving nerve cells in these areas could potentially change the path of the disorder. Medications like lithium which are used in treating bipolar disorder were recently discovered to actually boost levels of proteins that help neurons maintain their function. This may explain why lithium has been shown to be effective as a long term treatment. Using other methods to improve the health of neurons in the brain may create a more focused and efficient way to reduce symptoms quickly. Although more research needs to be done to determine long term results, nerve and brain health may be the focus of bipolar treatment in the future.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:20e044c2-af29-4922-89b1-b0ccc357332a>"]},{"passage":"Bipolar Disorder (cont.) In this Article\nWhat are the risk factors for bipolar disorder? Scientists are learning about the possible causes of bipolar disorder. Most scientists agree that there is no single cause. Rather, many factors likely act together to produce the illness or increase risk. Bipolar disorder tends to run in families, so researchers are looking for genes that may increase a person's chance of developing the illness. Genes are the \"building blocks\" of heredity. They help control how the body and brain work and grow. Genes are contained inside a person's cells that are passed down from parents to children. Children with a parent or sibling who has bipolar disorder are four to six times more likely to develop the illness, compared with children who do not have a family history of bipolar disorder. However, most children with a family history of bipolar disorder will not develop the illness. Genetic research on bipolar disorder is being helped by advances in technology. This type of research is now much quicker and more far-reaching than in the past. One example is the launch of the Bipolar Disorder Phenome Database, funded in part by NIMH. Using the database, scientists will be able to link visible signs of the disorder with the genes that may influence them. So far, researchers using this database found that most people with bipolar disorder had:\nThe researchers also identified certain traits that appeared to run in families, including:\nScientists continue to study these traits, which may help them find the genes that cause bipolar disorder some day. But genes are not the only risk factor for bipolar disorder. Studies of identical twins have shown that the twin of a person with bipolar illness does not always develop the disorder. This is important because identical twins share all of the same genes. The study results suggest factors besides genes are also at work. Rather, it is likely that many different genes and a person's environment are involved. However, scientists do not yet fully understand how these factors interact to cause bipolar disorder. Brain structure and functioning\nBrain-imaging studies are helping scientists learn what happens in the brain of a person with bipolar disorder. Newer brain-imaging tools, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), allow researchers to take pictures of the living brain at work. These tools help scientists study the brain's structure and activity. Some imaging studies show how the brains of people with bipolar disorder may differ from the brains of healthy people or people with other mental disorders. For example, one study using MRI found that the pattern of brain development in children with bipolar disorder was similar to that in children with \"multi-dimensional impairment,\" a disorder that causes symptoms that overlap somewhat with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. This suggests that the common pattern of brain development may be linked to general risk for unstable moods. Learning more about these differences, along with information gained from genetic studies, helps scientists better understand bipolar disorder. Someday scientists may be able to predict which types of treatment will work most effectively. They may even find ways to prevent bipolar disorder. How is bipolar disorder diagnosed? The first step in getting a proper diagnosis is to talk to a doctor, who may conduct a physical examination, an interview, and lab tests. Bipolar disorder cannot currently be identified through a blood test or a brain scan, but these tests can help rule out other contributing factors, such as a stroke or brain tumor. If the problems are not caused by other illnesses, the doctor may conduct a mental health evaluation. The doctor may also provide a referral to a trained mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist, who is experienced in diagnosing and treating bipolar disorder. The doctor or mental health professional should conduct a complete diagnostic evaluation. He or she should discuss any family history of bipolar disorder or other mental illnesses and get a complete history of symptoms. The doctor or mental health professionals should also talk to the person's close relatives or spouse and note how they describe the person's symptoms and family medical history. People with bipolar disorder are more likely to seek help when they are depressed than when experiencing mania or hypomania. Therefore, a careful medical history is needed to assure that bipolar disorder is not mistakenly diagnosed as major depressive disorder, which is also called unipolar depression.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:83a19198-4d7a-4dd9-b850-5ad97b6a05ea>"]}]}

The 97km road is part of a total 700km package to be constructed before oil starts flowing by 2022. The critical oil roads have been packaged into six, with two of the packages yet to receive a contractor. According to the Uganda National Roads Authority (Unra), the contractor—China Railway Seventh Group—under a pre-financing arrangement is expected to temporally meet the construction costs for a period of one year until the government secures funding. The authority, however, didn’t mention from where the government expects to secure the funds. During the contract signing in Kampala, Unra executive director Allen Kagina noted that at least 30 per cent of the works had been reserved for local contractors. In December 2016, the Cabinet directed Unra to have the roads in place to facilitate the transportation of construction materials by oil companies. Oil companies have previously complained that the bulk of the heavy machinery needed to construct oil wells is yet to be shipped into the country because it cannot be moved on existing roads. The companies said the machines are heavy that need good roads. Faced with this problem and time to beat, the authority is considering an option of having particular parts of the roads made motorable. “The contractor is called on to fast-track the work by beginning at two end points and also with bottlenecks like bridges, swamps, sharp corners so that the road is open to traffic even when the construction is incomplete,” said Mr Kagina. The authority however, is exercising caution on some of these roads since they pass through delicate ecosystems, such as Budongo forest, Murchison Falls National P ark and numerous swamps all of which need much environmental attention during construction. As a requirement of the three-year contract, Unra is expected to hand over the road site to the contractor who commences works in May this year when at least 30 per cent of the right of way has been secured to enable smooth movement. Land acquisition for major government projects in Uganda has been a problem, mostly over compensation disputes, which last year prompted Cabinet to suggest a constitutional amendments that will allow for compulsory acquisition of land by the government for major projects. Uganda has of 6.5 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves with about 2.2 billion recoverable. While the clock to 2020 ticks, Uganda is still faced with a challenge of completing major infrastructural development that will facilitate the oil sector like roads, a pipeline and the Kabaale international airport in Hoima district.\n\nKampala – Entebbe Expressway\nOpened to traffic in June 2018, Kampala – Entebbe expressway connects the Northern Bypass at Busega to Uganda’s international Airport.

It was meant to improve traffic conditions and mitigate the congestion on the bypass and the distributor roads in urban areas. Its routes and Design details\nThis infrastructure has two lanes in each direction and two road sections (36.94km long section and 12.68km long link road). The speed limit on this road ranges between 50km\/ -100km\/h. Its 36.94km long section is divided into two parts whereby the first 24.9km stretch of the sections starts at a point on the Kampala Northern Bypass and runs along the new route before ending at Abayita ababiri. The 12.04km section starts at the Interchange (Abayita ababiri) and winds along the existing Kampala-Entebbe road. 7.4km of it was widened and 4.64km upgraded to the latest standards. Apart from that, its 12.68km long roads originate from the highway at Kajjansi interchange and continue eastwards up to Munyonyo. Bridges and Interchanges on the Expressway\nAdding to the four interchanges at Kajjansi, Busega, Lweza and Mpala, this expressway features nineteen over-bridges and eighteen underpasses that provide access to other areas around. Besides that, three main toll plazas were built on the expressway at Mpala, Kajjansi and Busega. Mpala and Kajjansi toll plazas have five gates. The Busega toll plaza differs itself unique with six toll gates. Moreover, two suspension bridges that measure 200m and 500m by length were put up over the Lubiji swamp in Busega and Kyengera. Its highway includes a 75m long bridge at Kajjansi and the 1.45m long suspension bridge over Nambigirwa swamp. The 240 pillars that support Nambigirwa swamp have a lifespan of 100 years and were installed to a depth of 55m. The Main Contractors\nUNRA awarded the design-build contract to China Communication Construction Company in October 2010. Then in May 2012, Beijing Expressway Supervision was selected as the consulting engineer for the supervision of the design and construction of this road. The site project management, investigations and laboratory tests, and geotechnical survey services for the expressway were provided between January 2012 and 2013 by the Ugandan consulting firm Project Management and Engineering. Thereafter UNRA engaged the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank as the transaction adviser for this project. The IFC then contracted IMC Worldwide and Vetiver Associates to provide preliminary assessment for the toll road\nFinancing for the Project\nIt was jointly funded by the government of Uganda and the Exim Bank of China. Of $476 m for the project, Uganda contributed only USD 126m and the remaining part of USD350m came from the pockets of China Exim Bank but given as a preferential buyer credit loan. The agreement was signed by GoU in May 2011. This loan is to be paid back in a period of 40 years by the government through collecting taxes from its citizens. More to be paid is the USD 40m used for compensation to the landowners who were vacated from areas where the expressway passed. What are the Benefits of this toll road? The main aim of this world-class carriageway was to ease traffic congestion on main roads in Kampala city and its suburbs. Uganda’s road traffic is growing at an estimated rate of 4.5 per cent per year. This is due to the increased number of vehicles in Kampala and other cities. This path will also reduce the travel time from Kampala to Entebbe or vice versor. It takes about 30 minutes. This is time-saving when compared to 120 minutes for someone who is using the old Kampala – Entebbe road.\n\nThe environmental aspects of roads projects are normally addressed during the design phase and great efforts should be made to protect the surrounding natural environment from any related impacts. This includes everything from animals and plants, geology and landscape, and the natural processes that affect them all. If this can be done, and properly documented and informed, it is likely that fewer objections will be raised against the project. Note: both the road owner and contractor have a legal responsibility for any damage that may occur to the environment, and the consequential costs. The main aims in this work should be:\n• The identification of any species or special areas in the project before construction or rehabilitation work is started. • The protection of these species and areas during the construction process. One very important factor in designing totally new roads is to take into account any wild animal routes crossing the line of the new road and what measures would ne needed to allow the animals to cross the new road safely. The solution could be to plan special bridges or tunnels suitable for the animals. This will enhance traffic safety and reduce the numbers of deaths of wild animals on the road. In the design phase it is important to carry out a sufficient environmental analysis for each of the alternative engineering options to outline the impacts of the different alternatives on the natural environment. Environmental analyses are not always required by law, but they are very useful tools to illustrate impacts during the design process. When the likely impacts are known, they be used to make good decisions. Special care should be taken for known sensitive area in the planned works to ensure that all interested parties are aware of their type and location. Measures can be taken where necessary to protect the objects physically. A simple fence may sometimes be sufficient, whereas more substantial protection may be needed for other sites. The time of the year may also be important for some animal species. A bird that is sitting on eggs or has chicks during the early summer may be very sensitive to disturbances such as grass cutting, whereas the same bird may migrate in the autumn thus removing the concern. Roads projects may occasionally run through terrain that, for a variety of reasons, is fully protected under a nature conservation order. In this case, it is particularly important that all work is contained within the approved road area, and that care is taken to ensure that everyone involved is aware of this. Existing parking sites should be used for parking vehicles and storing equipment, preferably in consultation with nature conservation authorities. Common sense is often enough for dealing with these matters. If assistance is needed, the authorities responsible can be consulted and they, in turn, will contact centres of appropriate competence if they consider it necessary.

This is the “meat” of the contract, and perhaps the one that your lawyer will offer most of the instructions until you get the ride. But people rarely go wrong when they are too specific; it is the lack of essential details or uncertainty that can cause problems. If you enter into a z.B business contract to sell your office copier, you must provide details such as a description of the equipment, sale price, terms of sale and date of transaction. There are six essential elements necessary for a contract to be valid (enforceable through the courts). The first three, which are considered together, refer to the agreement itself and the other three relate to the parties who enter into the contract. Contractual guarantees are less important conditions and are not fundamental to the agreement. They cannot terminate a contract if the guarantees are not fulfilled, but they can claim damages for the losses incurred. While these are some of the most common legal agreements you might see in an economic context, they can cover an almost infinite number of topics as long as the elements are in place and are not prohibited by law. And while some contracts may not need to be written, ALWAYS is a better idea to do so. Both parties must be “reasonable” to understand the seriousness of the situation and understand what is necessary. This definition requires that neither party be minor, both must be sober (not under the influence of drugs or alcohol when signing the contract) and no rehabilitation can be mentally deficient. If a party is not competent, the contract is not valid and the unmarried party may refuse (ignore) the contract. Contract management is part of running a small business. They will have a number of business relationships that involve some kind of contractual obligation or obligation. Don`t waste time negotiating a commercial contract with someone who doesn`t have the power to make a binding decision. It should be in the person`s best interest to ensure that you are complying with the obligations of the agreement. Legality should be the simplest part of the contract. This means that the terms and conditions must be legal; If not, the contract is not valid. For example, the sale of a photocopier is legal; Breaking into a closed store in the middle of the night, stealing a photocopier and selling it on an online shopping site is not the case. Each contract must include a specific offer and acceptance of that specific offer. Both parties must accept their free will. Neither party can be forced or forced to sign the contract and both parties must agree to the same conditions. These three conditions imply the intention of the parties to create a binding agreement. If one or both parties are not serious, there is no contract. TIP: If it is not possible to have a written contract, make sure you have other documentation such as emails, offers or notes of your discussions to help you identify what has been agreed. Contractual terms are fundamental to the agreement.\n\nWFP APPEALS FOR FUNDS FOR DEMINING AND ROAD REPAIRS IN SOUTH SUDAN\nNAIROBI -WFP today appealed for urgent funding for road repairs and demining of key transport routes in southern Sudan to help people return after decades of war, and connect the region to northern Sudan and neighbouring countries. WFP said it faced an immediate shortfall of US$4.8 million in 2004 for the first phase and would need US$64 million for a special operation in 2005. It said funds for 2005 are needed as soon as possible because work should be done as much as possible during the dry season from October 2004 to May 2005. \"Investment in infrastructure is crucial to getting southern Sudan on its long-awaited road to recovery after decades of conflict. It is also urgent because between 600,000 and 1.2 million people are expected to return after the signing of a final peace agreement for the south,\" said Barbara van Logchem, WFP Project Manager for the Special Operation. \"These roads are the arteries to attract people back to the south. Delayed funding now means less opportunity for repairs during the dry season, which in turn means no visible peace dividend. This also delays economic growth and resettlement for people desperate for a new beginning,\" she added. The Government of Sudan and Sudan People's Liberation Movement\/Army (SPLM\/A) are expected to sign a final peace agreement covering the south by the end of December. South Sudan covers 650,000 square kilometers -- the size of Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi combined. Yet the total road network is only 7,500 kilometres of main roads, most of which are unusable at least for part of the year, plus 10,000 kilometres of key feeder roads. None are tarmac except for a few kilometers in Juba town. WFP's Special Road Operation aims to facilitate the return and resettlement of people while providing visual, tangible peace dividends and contributing to conflict prevention. Better roads also stimulate economic growth through increased transportation and trade. With roads linked to the River Nile, the cost of food production and delivery will be reduced while farmers' access to markets will grow. In addition, the delivery costs of food aid will decrease and eventually the need for large quantities of aid to support people in southern Sudan should diminish. The first phase of WFP road repairs and demining ran from January until October this year, budgeted at US$21 million. It included the repair of three main routes: the Western Corridor linking south Sudan to Uganda, the Eastern Corridor linking the south to Kenya and a dyke\/road project in Bor County to mitigate flooding from the Nile, improve food security and start opening up access to the north. Already, daily bus services have started from Uganda into Sudan and up to the town of Yei and more types of vehicles are using the road, allowing small entrepreneurs to use pickups. Transport rates have dropped and prices of basic items such as maize, soap, sugar, soap and fuel have decreased by 20 percent in Yei since the beginning of the year. The second phase, covered by the Special Operation, aims to demine and repair eight additional routes for a total distance of 1,600 kilometres. Implementation of the second phase, which could have started in October 2004 was delayed to January 2005 because of a lack of funding. The WFP Special Operation activities were identified as an urgent need by the SPLM at the Oslo donor meeting in September 2004. Work can commence as soon as funding is made available. The project will ensure an immediate and visible impact on the ground. To date, WFP's road repair and demining in southern Sudan since January this year has received contributions from the United States (US$16.7 million), the Netherlands (US$3.3 million), Norway (US$1 million) and Italy (US$300,000). Note to Editors and Reporters Covering the Nairobi Summit on a Mine-Free World: video and photographs are available of road rehabilitation and demining in Sudan\nWFP is the world's largest humanitarian agency: in 2003 we gave food aid to a record 104 million people in 81 countries, including 56 million hungry children.

Two key elements will be covered under the project, namely a new multi lane highway connecting Kampala to the international airport in Entebbe and a branch route from Lweza to Munyonyo, a convention and resort centre at the shores of Lake Victoria. The second is of particular importance as visitors coming for meetings, conventions, conferences and large scale government meetings will upon completion be able to bypass the city entirely on their way from the airport to Munyonyo. The main section though, just over 51 kilometres long, will be operated as a toll road with users having to part with the shillings, worth though considering the time savings one can generate. The cost, estimated to be in the region of 450+ US Dollars, is financed by China – a Chinese construction company will carry out the work, similar in scope to the new super highway between Nairobi and Thika in Kenya – with the Ugandan government chipping in an estimated 100 million US Dollars to the overall cost. Like neighbouring Kenya, Uganda too has finally and almost belatedly woken to the reality that new roads, highways and bridges are key to future economic and social development. The planned construction of a new Nile bridge in Jinja is due to start in 2013, eventually connecting the new widened 4 lane highway planned between Kampala and Jinja and from Jinja to the border with Kenya in Malaba and Busia. This project is also thought to be in the final planning stages. Today though all eyes will be on the new Entebbe highway project, due to be completed within about three years time at which time us locals as well as our regular visitors will be able to take a collective breath of relief.\n\n- О КОМПАНИИ\n- РАБОТА В КОМПАНИИ\nMinistry of Transport and Roads of the Kyrgyz Republic\n41 Millions Euro\nEPKIN-DYIKAN ROAD (km 89+500 – km 159+200).

Entebbe Road leads to Uganda’s only international airport, and is one of the country’s busiest roads. The road links Wakiso District to Kibuye in Kampala to Mpala, Entebbe - passing through Kibuye, Kajjansi, and Abayita Ababiri before ending at the airport, a total distance of about 40 kilometres. Before the opening of the Entebbe–Kampala Expressway, the Entebbe road was the only direct link between Kampala and the international airport. The road is a single carriageway, and is narrow and congested with a heavy volume of traffic on the road. Because of the congestion, it is one of the most accident-prone roads in the country. Traffic on this road had reduced substantially after the completion of the Kampala-Entebbe Expressway in 2018, as many motorists resorted to using the expressway as an alternative route to avoid traffic congestion on the existing Kampala-Entebbe road. However, traffic on the road has since increased following the government implementation of toll payments on the Kampala-Entebbe Expressway in January this year (2022). Experience the impeccable road stretch away from the hustle of the city, as you drive past magnificent nature with fresh air kicking in across every bend. Experience the Kampala- Entebbe Expressway in all its glory. #KEEUG #ExploreUganda pic.twitter.com\/Sub1dt5NuL— Kampala Entebbe Expressway (@KEE_UG) March 29, 2022\nLast year, the Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) awarded a contract for the rehabilitation of a 22 kilometres stretch of the Entebbe road from Mpala, Entebbe in Wakiso District to Kibuye in Kampala. UNRA is the Ugandan government agency responsible for developing and maintaining the country's national roads network and advise the government on general road policies and national transport concerns. The contract for the rehabilitation of the 22 kilometre road stretch from Entebbe to Kibuye was awarded to the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), at a cost of US$12 million. The scope of the rehabilitation works includes the restoration of existing sidewalks, the construction of drainage channels to avoid flooding, in particular around the Kajjansi region, and the installation of street lights. Construction works commenced on the rehabilitation of the road sometime in August \/ September 2021. At the end of March this year (2022), the CCCC site engineer on the project, Mr Guo Zitong, stated that the project was 50% complete and would be completed within five months, i.e. in August this year (2022). This is according to a news article posted on the website of the Daily Monitor, a Ugandan newspaper. The Daily Monitor article also reported that the UNRA media relations manager, Mr Allan Ssempebwa, said that the road rehabilitation works in the section between Mpala and Kisubi in Wakiso district included stone pitching of side drains to aid the adequate flow of stormwater, shoulder repair, major full road width repairs, and installation of access culverts as well as access road construction to reduce silt damage on main pavements. Ssempebwa further explained that “Particular attention will be given to some sections, especially those prone to floodings, such as Lubowa, Zzana and Namasuba. For instance, the Bata-Bata area will be fixed with proper drainage systems”. Also speaking on the Entebbe-Kibuye road rehabilitation, Mr Francis Ojok, speaking on behalf of the officer in charge of Traffic in the Kajjansi area, emphasized the importance of the roadworks to free up traffic issues in the area. The introduction of pedestrian walkways will also help reduce the number of traffic accidents. Currently, traffic management is difficult due to the blocking of part of the roadway to aid the construction work. Assistant Superintendent of Police, Luke Nuwataho, also commented that the Kajjansi area has been experiencing flooding which should be resolved by the road works.

The 97km road is part of a total 700km package to be constructed before oil starts flowing by 2022. The critical oil roads have been packaged into six, with two of the packages yet to receive a contractor. According to the Uganda National Roads Authority (Unra), the contractor—China Railway Seventh Group—under a pre-financing arrangement is expected to temporally meet the construction costs for a period of one year until the government secures funding. The authority, however, didn’t mention from where the government expects to secure the funds. During the contract signing in Kampala, Unra executive director Allen Kagina noted that at least 30 per cent of the works had been reserved for local contractors. In December 2016, the Cabinet directed Unra to have the roads in place to facilitate the transportation of construction materials by oil companies. Oil companies have previously complained that the bulk of the heavy machinery needed to construct oil wells is yet to be shipped into the country because it cannot be moved on existing roads. The companies said the machines are heavy that need good roads. Faced with this problem and time to beat, the authority is considering an option of having particular parts of the roads made motorable. “The contractor is called on to fast-track the work by beginning at two end points and also with bottlenecks like bridges, swamps, sharp corners so that the road is open to traffic even when the construction is incomplete,” said Mr Kagina. The authority however, is exercising caution on some of these roads since they pass through delicate ecosystems, such as Budongo forest, Murchison Falls National P ark and numerous swamps all of which need much environmental attention during construction. As a requirement of the three-year contract, Unra is expected to hand over the road site to the contractor who commences works in May this year when at least 30 per cent of the right of way has been secured to enable smooth movement. Land acquisition for major government projects in Uganda has been a problem, mostly over compensation disputes, which last year prompted Cabinet to suggest a constitutional amendments that will allow for compulsory acquisition of land by the government for major projects. Uganda has of 6.5 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves with about 2.2 billion recoverable. While the clock to 2020 ticks, Uganda is still faced with a challenge of completing major infrastructural development that will facilitate the oil sector like roads, a pipeline and the Kabaale international airport in Hoima district.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e72a2831-82ab-4e50-9736-bb94c91209cb>"]},{"passage":"Kampala – Entebbe Expressway\nOpened to traffic in June 2018, Kampala – Entebbe expressway connects the Northern Bypass at Busega to Uganda’s international Airport.

The first three, which are considered together, refer to the agreement itself and the other three relate to the parties who enter into the contract. Contractual guarantees are less important conditions and are not fundamental to the agreement. They cannot terminate a contract if the guarantees are not fulfilled, but they can claim damages for the losses incurred. While these are some of the most common legal agreements you might see in an economic context, they can cover an almost infinite number of topics as long as the elements are in place and are not prohibited by law. And while some contracts may not need to be written, ALWAYS is a better idea to do so. Both parties must be “reasonable” to understand the seriousness of the situation and understand what is necessary. This definition requires that neither party be minor, both must be sober (not under the influence of drugs or alcohol when signing the contract) and no rehabilitation can be mentally deficient. If a party is not competent, the contract is not valid and the unmarried party may refuse (ignore) the contract. Contract management is part of running a small business. They will have a number of business relationships that involve some kind of contractual obligation or obligation. Don`t waste time negotiating a commercial contract with someone who doesn`t have the power to make a binding decision. It should be in the person`s best interest to ensure that you are complying with the obligations of the agreement. Legality should be the simplest part of the contract. This means that the terms and conditions must be legal; If not, the contract is not valid. For example, the sale of a photocopier is legal; Breaking into a closed store in the middle of the night, stealing a photocopier and selling it on an online shopping site is not the case. Each contract must include a specific offer and acceptance of that specific offer. Both parties must accept their free will. Neither party can be forced or forced to sign the contract and both parties must agree to the same conditions. These three conditions imply the intention of the parties to create a binding agreement. If one or both parties are not serious, there is no contract. TIP: If it is not possible to have a written contract, make sure you have other documentation such as emails, offers or notes of your discussions to help you identify what has been agreed. Contractual terms are fundamental to the agreement.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:79a7e0c1-cff7-4f07-a94d-3b146e12d13d>"]},{"passage":"WFP APPEALS FOR FUNDS FOR DEMINING AND ROAD REPAIRS IN SOUTH SUDAN\nNAIROBI -WFP today appealed for urgent funding for road repairs and demining of key transport routes in southern Sudan to help people return after decades of war, and connect the region to northern Sudan and neighbouring countries. WFP said it faced an immediate shortfall of US$4.8 million in 2004 for the first phase and would need US$64 million for a special operation in 2005. It said funds for 2005 are needed as soon as possible because work should be done as much as possible during the dry season from October 2004 to May 2005. \"Investment in infrastructure is crucial to getting southern Sudan on its long-awaited road to recovery after decades of conflict. It is also urgent because between 600,000 and 1.2 million people are expected to return after the signing of a final peace agreement for the south,\" said Barbara van Logchem, WFP Project Manager for the Special Operation. \"These roads are the arteries to attract people back to the south. Delayed funding now means less opportunity for repairs during the dry season, which in turn means no visible peace dividend. This also delays economic growth and resettlement for people desperate for a new beginning,\" she added. The Government of Sudan and Sudan People's Liberation Movement\/Army (SPLM\/A) are expected to sign a final peace agreement covering the south by the end of December. South Sudan covers 650,000 square kilometers -- the size of Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi combined. Yet the total road network is only 7,500 kilometres of main roads, most of which are unusable at least for part of the year, plus 10,000 kilometres of key feeder roads. None are tarmac except for a few kilometers in Juba town. WFP's Special Road Operation aims to facilitate the return and resettlement of people while providing visual, tangible peace dividends and contributing to conflict prevention. Better roads also stimulate economic growth through increased transportation and trade. With roads linked to the River Nile, the cost of food production and delivery will be reduced while farmers' access to markets will grow. In addition, the delivery costs of food aid will decrease and eventually the need for large quantities of aid to support people in southern Sudan should diminish. The first phase of WFP road repairs and demining ran from January until October this year, budgeted at US$21 million. It included the repair of three main routes: the Western Corridor linking south Sudan to Uganda, the Eastern Corridor linking the south to Kenya and a dyke\/road project in Bor County to mitigate flooding from the Nile, improve food security and start opening up access to the north. Already, daily bus services have started from Uganda into Sudan and up to the town of Yei and more types of vehicles are using the road, allowing small entrepreneurs to use pickups. Transport rates have dropped and prices of basic items such as maize, soap, sugar, soap and fuel have decreased by 20 percent in Yei since the beginning of the year. The second phase, covered by the Special Operation, aims to demine and repair eight additional routes for a total distance of 1,600 kilometres. Implementation of the second phase, which could have started in October 2004 was delayed to January 2005 because of a lack of funding. The WFP Special Operation activities were identified as an urgent need by the SPLM at the Oslo donor meeting in September 2004. Work can commence as soon as funding is made available. The project will ensure an immediate and visible impact on the ground. To date, WFP's road repair and demining in southern Sudan since January this year has received contributions from the United States (US$16.7 million), the Netherlands (US$3.3 million), Norway (US$1 million) and Italy (US$300,000). Note to Editors and Reporters Covering the Nairobi Summit on a Mine-Free World: video and photographs are available of road rehabilitation and demining in Sudan\nWFP is the world's largest humanitarian agency: in 2003 we gave food aid to a record 104 million people in 81 countries, including 56 million hungry children.

Two key elements will be covered under the project, namely a new multi lane highway connecting Kampala to the international airport in Entebbe and a branch route from Lweza to Munyonyo, a convention and resort centre at the shores of Lake Victoria. The second is of particular importance as visitors coming for meetings, conventions, conferences and large scale government meetings will upon completion be able to bypass the city entirely on their way from the airport to Munyonyo. The main section though, just over 51 kilometres long, will be operated as a toll road with users having to part with the shillings, worth though considering the time savings one can generate. The cost, estimated to be in the region of 450+ US Dollars, is financed by China – a Chinese construction company will carry out the work, similar in scope to the new super highway between Nairobi and Thika in Kenya – with the Ugandan government chipping in an estimated 100 million US Dollars to the overall cost. Like neighbouring Kenya, Uganda too has finally and almost belatedly woken to the reality that new roads, highways and bridges are key to future economic and social development. The planned construction of a new Nile bridge in Jinja is due to start in 2013, eventually connecting the new widened 4 lane highway planned between Kampala and Jinja and from Jinja to the border with Kenya in Malaba and Busia. This project is also thought to be in the final planning stages. Today though all eyes will be on the new Entebbe highway project, due to be completed within about three years time at which time us locals as well as our regular visitors will be able to take a collective breath of relief.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:6f2a9d3f-0bdf-412d-839e-5f43e5fd26ad>"]},{"passage":"- О КОМПАНИИ\n- РАБОТА В КОМПАНИИ\nMinistry of Transport and Roads of the Kyrgyz Republic\n41 Millions Euro\nEPKIN-DYIKAN ROAD (km 89+500 – km 159+200).

{"id":48,"doc_id":"<urn:uuid:6e6eb558-772c-41db-9038-c397d3331fcd>","text":"What is a Corporation? A corporation is a business entity that is owned by its shareholder(s), who elect a board of directors to oversee the organization’s activities. The corporation is liable for the actions and finances of the business – the shareholders are not. Corporations can be for-profit, as businesses are, or not-for-profit, as charitable organizations typically are. Types of Corporations There are two major types of corporations as well: Subchapter C corporations, which are larger organizations owned by multiple shareholders, which can also be other businesses, and Subchapter S corporations, which are often (but not always) smaller businesses owned by an individual shareholder. Before creating a corporation, consider what you hope to gain from establishing this separate entity. The biggest advantages of having a corporation are: - As with some other types of businesses, corporations provide liability protection for its owners, who are called shareholders. - Companies hoping to raise money from investors will have an easier time as a corporation, which can sell ownership shares. - Corporate profits are taxed, but at a lower rate than the personal income tax rate individuals pay. - Potential employees may find working for a corporation, with the prospect of ownership benefits, to be more appealing than working for a privately-held company. - The corporation can offer a medical reimbursement plan, deducting the cost of providing insurance to employees while allowing employees to use the benefit tax-free. While corporations can certainly shield owners from liability, the downsides are sizeable and very costly: - C Corporations are complex and expensive to set up. - Once established, corporations spend significant sums of money to stay on top of changing business regulations and timely filing of paperwork. They are best for large organizations with many employees. - Corporations pay federal, state, and sometimes local taxes on profits, unlike LLCs. - The corporation pays taxes on dividends paid to shareholders, who then pay taxes on that income themselves. Forming a Corporation Corporations are often formed in the state in which the business operates, but it doesn’t have to be. Some corporations are formed in states thought to be pro-business, such as Delaware or Nevada, although that creates extra paperwork. You then need to register the corporation as a foreign entity in the state in which you are doing business, and pay taxes to that state. The next step is creating Articles of Incorporation, which are filed with the state in which you have registered the corporation. These include: - The name and physical address of the business. - A description of the business and its goods and services. - The name and address of the registered agent, or the person authorized to receive official notices. - A count of the number of shares issued and to whom. And then create by-laws, which are the rules of the corporation. They include, at a minimum: - How often the board of directors meets, and when. - Whether the business operates on a calendar or fiscal year. - How long board members can serve. - Rules for changing by-laws. By-laws can be amended as needed once the corporation is formed. If you expect at some point in the near future to take your company public through an initial public offering (IPO), a C corporation may make a lot of sense.","question_category":"first turn question; Natural","question_category_desc":"the initial question of a conversation, and therefore self-contained and understandable, without any other context.; phrased in the way people typically speak, reflecting everyday language use, without formal or artificial structure.","user_category":"Expert","user_category_desc":"A specialized user with deep understanding of the corpus.","question":"What are the key tax implications for corporations compared to other business structures?","gold":"Corporations face distinct tax implications: they pay federal, state, and sometimes local taxes on profits, unlike LLCs. Additionally, there's a double taxation situation where the corporation pays taxes on dividends paid to shareholders, and then shareholders must pay taxes on that income themselves. However, corporate profits are taxed at a lower rate than the personal income tax rate individuals pay.","answer":"Corporations have distinct tax implications compared to other business structures like sole proprietorships, partnerships, and LLCs (Limited Liability Companies). Here are the key differences:\n\n1. **Corporate Tax Structure**: Corporations are subject to double taxation. This means that the corporation itself pays taxes on its profits at the corporate tax rate (currently 21% under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), and then when the profits are distributed to shareholders as dividends, the shareholders pay personal income tax on those dividends. This is often referred to as \"double taxation.\"\n\n2. **Pass-Through Entities**: In contrast, sole proprietorships, partnerships, and LLCs (when structured as pass-through entities) are not subject to corporate tax. Instead, the profits and losses of these businesses pass through to the owners, who report them on their personal tax returns. This avoids double taxation, as the income is only taxed once at the individual level.\n\n3. **Tax Rates**: The tax rates for pass-through entities can vary based on the individual tax brackets of the owners. For instance, if a business owner falls into a high tax bracket, the tax on the business's profits could be significant. However, owners can often deduct certain expenses, reducing their taxable income.\n\n4. **Flexibility and Complexity**: Corporations offer more flexibility in terms of raising capital through stock issuance, which can be an advantage for businesses looking to expand or attract investors. However, this flexibility comes with more complexity and compliance requirements, such as maintaining detailed corporate records, holding regular meetings, and filing more extensive tax documents.\n\n5. **Limited Liability Protection**: Both corporations and LLCs offer limited liability protection to their owners, meaning that the owners' personal assets are generally protected from business debts and liabilities. Sole proprietorships and general partnerships do not offer this protection, making the owners personally liable for business debts.\n\n6. **Self-Employment Taxes**: Owners of sole proprietorships, partnerships, and LLCs (when not structured as corporations) are also responsible for paying self-employment taxes, which cover Social Security and Medicare contributions. This tax is not applicable to corporate shareholders who receive salary or wages.\n\n7. **Deductions and Expenses**: All business structures can deduct business-related expenses, but the specifics can vary. For example, corporations can deduct a portion of employee salaries, while sole proprietors and partners may deduct a larger percentage of their own compensation, as they are considered self-employed.\n\n8. **International Tax Considerations**: Corporations may face additional tax considerations when operating internationally, such as foreign tax credits and potentially different tax rates in foreign jurisdictions. Pass-through entities may also face international tax issues, but the specifics can vary based on the individual owners' residency and the structure of the business.\n\n9. **Estate Planning and Succession**: Corporations offer more flexibility in estate planning and succession planning. Shareholders can sell their shares, and the corporation can continue operating. For pass-through entities, the death of a partner or owner can complicate ownership and require restructuring or liquidation.\n\nUnderstanding these tax implications is crucial for business owners when choosing a business structure, as it directly impacts their financial obligations and overall profitability. Consulting with a tax professional or attorney is often recommended to navigate these complexities and ensure compliance with tax laws.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context:\nWhen it comes to setting up corporate structures there are a variety of considerations to bear in mind. There are both commercial and tax implications that need to be considered. The adage that the tax tail should not wag the commercial dog is very true in these situations. However, one of the main commercial considerations in determining the best structure for the business is actually to consider the tax implications, as they will have a big impact on the financials for the business. Setting up a Limited company:\nA Limited company structure provides important protection due to the \"limited liability\" characteristic of companies. By being a Limited liability company it means that the shareholders are protected from loss of their own personal assets. Another advantage of Limited company status is the current favourable taxation treatment of companies compared with sole traders\/individuals. Some problems inherent with a Limited liability structure include that the structure is rather rigid in that incoming or exiting shareholders will have various implications for the business - and there will be taxation implications on the disposal of shares or \"company buy back\" of shares. Limited Liability Partnerships:\nLimited liability partnerships allow for greater flexibility in that profits sharing ratios can be changed dependant on private agreements of the Partners. The main constituational document of the partnership will be the partnership agreement. This will control the way in which the partnership interacts and behaves with its members and the way in which business is conducted by the partnership. An LLP is tax transparent and therefore the taxation of the profits of the partnership fall onto the \"members\" of the LLP. There are a variety of benefits in setting up a corporate group structure - either at the inception of the business or at a future point in time. We have advised many clients on the benefits of setting up a corporate structure such that they can benefit from important tax reliefs such as Substantial Shareholders' exemption on a disposal of part of the business. It is important to liaise with us in advance of making any important decisions as there will often be certain ways of carrying out transactions that will be more beneficial from a taxation perspective. Please contact your usual MG Group contact if you would like to find out more about the options available in setting up a business structure and to determine what the advantages and disadvantages are from each type of business structure.\n\nAs a small business owner, it's important to understand the tax implications of your business decisions. Failing to comply with tax laws can result in penalties and fines, so it's essential to stay informed about the tax considerations that apply to your business. In this blog post, we will explore some of the key tax considerations that small businesses need to be aware of. The type of business structure you choose, such as sole proprietorship, partnership, LLC or corporation, will affect how your business is taxed. It's essential to understand the tax implications of each business structure and choose the one that best suits your needs. Small businesses can claim deductions for various business expenses, such as office rent, employee salaries, office supplies, and more. Be sure to keep accurate records and receipts of your business expenses to maximize your deductions. Depending on the type of business you run, you may be required to collect sales taxes from customers and remit them to the government. It's important to understand the sales tax laws that apply to your business and to stay current with changes in the tax code. Self-employed individuals and small business owners are often required to pay estimated taxes throughout the year. It's important to understand the rules for estimated taxes and to make timely payments to avoid penalties. As an employer, you are responsible for withholding taxes from your employees' paychecks and remitting them to the government. You must also file the necessary forms with the government to report the taxes you have withheld. Small business owners can take advantage of retirement plans, such as a solo 401(k) or a Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRA, to save for retirement and reduce their tax liabilities. If you do business in multiple countries, you may be subject to international tax laws and regulations. A business attorney or a tax expert can advise you on your international tax obligations.

Whenever you start a business, you will have to select one organizational type from out of all the different business structures. This choice determines how your business will be set up and organized. In most instances, you will probably have to choose between a limited liability company (LLC), a partnership, a corporation, or a sole proprietorship. There are some criteria that you can use to find the business structure that works the best for your purpose. These criteria are:\nThe general rule for this category is that the more dangerous or risky the activity that your business will engage in, the less personal liability you want to have. Both corporations and LLCs allow business owners a type of \"limited liability,\" where anyone seeking claims against the business will have a very hard time placing personal liability on you as the owner. Conversely, if you were to organize your business as a partnership or a sole proprietorship, you could be personally responsible for anything the business did wrong. Expenses and Procedures\nIn general, there is no special paperwork that needs to be filed in order to establish either of these business structures. In addition, there are rarely any fees associated with establishing or maintaining either of these business structures. LLCs and corporations, on the other hand, are almost always more difficult and expensive to establish and maintain. In order to establish a corporation or limited liability company, you must file \"Articles of Incorporation\" with your secretary of state and pay fees associated with the incorporation. The details of the articles of incorporation and the amount of the fee will vary depending upon the state where you set up your business. In addition, when deciding to form a corporation or LLC, the owners of the business must decide which officers to elect to run the company. LLCs and corporations must keep specific and detailed records of any important business decisions, and follow many other formalities that are associated with these business structures. The easiest way to think about the different income tax structures that these business structures will use is to break them into two categories -- one comprised of those business structures where the business owners pay taxes on business profits, and one that includes all business structures where the business owners do not pay taxes on business profits. The first category includes sole proprietorships, partnerships and LLCs. These business structures are often referred to as \"pass-through\" tax entities because the taxes on the business profits and losses pass through to the business owners on their personal income taxes. Business owners of sole proprietorships, partnerships and LLCs must report and pay taxes on all net profits from their business, even if they take no money out of the business' account during the tax year. Unlike the pass through tax businesses, the owners of a corporation do not pay taxes on the net business profits of the corporation. Instead, the business owners of a corporation pay taxes only on the profits they actually take from the corporation in the form of salaries, dividends and bonuses. Because a corporation is a separate tax entity, it must pay taxes on any profits that remain within the company during a tax year, and also on any profits that it pays out in the form of dividends to shareholders. There is a tax benefit to forming your business as a corporation. The owners of a corporation do not pay taxes on any profits that the corporation keeps, and the corporation pays taxes at a lower rate than do some individuals. Structuring a business as a corporation allows a business to sell shares of ownership in the business through stock offerings. This is different than the other three business structures, which do not allow the selling of part of the business through the sale of stocks. Because of this investment scheme, it may allow owners of a corporation to attract investors and retain employees more easily by offering stock. If you never plan on having your business go on sale to the public, however, and don't need the investment incentives to retain employees, you probably do not need to go through the added procedure and cost of forming a corporation. If you desire the limited personal liability that comes from a corporation, you could instead form your business as a LLC. An LLC provides many of the advantages of a corporation while remaining more flexible. Let an Attorney Help You Form Your New Business\nWhether you're just starting your new business, would like to transition your business to a different legal structure, or have other questions regarding your business, you may benefit tremendously from legal assistance.\n\nOver the past 30 years, the activity of businesses that are subject to the individual income tax has grown compared with that of businesses subject to the corporate income tax. That shift has reduced federal revenues but probably promoted overall investment and a more efficient allocation of resources. Most business receipts—the revenues that businesses receive from sales of goods and services—come from a relatively small number of firms subject to the corporate income tax, called C corporations. However, other organizational forms allow businesses to avoid the corporate tax by passing their profits through to their owners, where they are subject to the individual income tax. Use of those pass-through structures has grown: In 1980, 83 percent of firms passed profits through to their owners for taxation, and they accounted for 14 percent of business receipts; by 2007, those shares had increased to 94 percent and 38 percent, respectively. Organizational forms that provide owners with the same protection from liability for the debts of the firm that the owners of C corporations receive were almost entirely responsible for that growth. Today’s CBO report Taxing Businesses Through the Individual Income Tax examines the size and causes of the shift in organizational structure, the effect it has had on federal revenues, and the potential effects on revenues and investment of various alternative approaches to taxing businesses’ profits. The report examines three potential approaches to the taxation of businesses’ profits:\nThis report was prepared by Paul Burnham of CBO’s Tax Analysis Division.\n\nLiquidations and Dissolutions: Critical Tax Implications for Businesses\nProactive Steps to Minimize Negative Income Tax Consequences\nRecording of a 110-minute CPE\/CLE webinar with Q&A\nThis CLE webinar will update advisors' awareness of the key federal income tax implications throughout the business dissolution or liquidation processes, and offer alternative tax compliance and tax planning strategies. - Differences in dissolutions vs. liquidations\n- When a company legally remains in business even though it has dissolved\n- Whether a company’s status as a corporation is ended by an administrative dissolution\n- Distribution of gains and losses to shareholders in a liquidation\n- Taxation at both the business and shareholder levels in a liquidation\n- Tax issues of common transactions in a dissolution or liquidation\n- Shareholder loans to a from a business\n- Handling contingent liabilities\n- Working with different state processes for dissolving a business\n- Errors and omissions in a depreciation schedule\n- Possible tax planning issues\n- Tax differences between repossession of assets for debt payment, and debt forgiveness\n- Timing of sales of high-cost-basis assets at a loss to offset gains on sales of zero- or low-basis assets\n- Timing sales of assets with payment of deductible business expenses, to avoid large Schedule F losses in one year and large gains in another\n- Tax consequences of converting from C corporation to S corporation or LLC, and vice versa\nThe panel will cover these and other relevant topics:\n- Understanding the tax differences between administrative dissolution and liquidation, and whether it's possible for a business to close without suffering the tax bite of complete liquidation. - Employing tax strategies to handle commonplace transactions such as shareholder loans to and from a business and contingent liabilities. - Undertaking tax planning for higher-level issues — such as timing sales of high-cost-basis assets at a loss, sale of assets to offset payment of deductible business expenses, or a partner buyout through stock redemption.

All taxes, including business activity taxes, are “people taxes” and have an economic impact. Since only people can pay taxes, the tax burden ultimately falls on various groups of people. Business taxes include corporate franchise tax, employment tax, excise tax, gross receipts tax, and value added tax, VAT. How Are Applicable Taxes Determined? All firms must pay certain taxes, including:\n- Sales tax\nThe type of business a person owns will determine additional taxes they may pay. For example, insurance, mining and petroleum extraction companies are required to pay additional taxes specifically related to their industries. It is not uncommon for firms to pay a fee for doing business in a particular jurisdiction. What Is a Value-Added Tax? A value-added tax, VAT, also referred to as a goods and service tax is a consumption tax that is placed or assessed incrementally. The amount is based on the increase in value of the good or service at each stage, from production to point of sale. It avoids the double taxation of a direct sales tax because the producer or distributor does not get burdened with the tax. The end consumer ultimately catches the full brunt of the tax. Choosing the Returns You Must File\nThere are several return types and the one you file depends on your business structure. Sole proprietors and any other business structure with a pass-through structure file Form 1040. A pass-through structure allows owners to report business and expenses as part of their personal tax return. If you operate as a C corporation you will submit a copy of the 1120 Form and S corporations will submit the 1120s Form. Both nonprofit organizations and general partnerships will use information returns. Nonprofit organizations will use the 990 Form and general partnerships will use 1065 Form. Business-related returns will vary and may include sales and usage tax, payroll taxes and other specific state and local taxes. Also, the Form 1040-ES will include the estimated tax payments. Again, the tax rates will vary depending on the business structure you operate under and the type of business you have. Sole proprietors will file their return and face normal federal income tax rates on any revenue they generate through their self-employment. These rates can go as high as 39.6% and as low as 10%. This is also applicable to any business owner with a pass-through business structure, such as S corporations and partnerships. Take note, this does not include the 15.3 self-employment tax you may be subject too, nor any state or local taxes. Do All Businesses Incur a Corporate Income Tax? It is most likely that you will incur a corporate income tax if you operate as a C corporation or an LLC. This is based on the amount your corporation earns and essentially, the more you earn the more you pay in taxes. Tax rates start at 15% and go up to as high as 39%. Depending on where you conduct your business, you may have state and local corporate taxes as well. Tax Advantages for Businesses\nA big advantage at tax time for business owners is the opportunity to deduct every single business-related expense. Of course, individuals do not get to write off near as many deductions. For example, as a business owner, you can deduct 50% of any business-related meals and entertainment. In addition, vehicle expenses, home office expenses are all eligible deductions if they are in some way related to your business. This means your deductions can range from paper clips to high-powered computer servers as long as you document and keep your receipts to prove your deductions at tax time. Responsibility to Pay Taxes\nConversely, being your own boss and having huge deductions also comes with having a huge amount of responsibility. You are required to make sure your local, state, and federal taxes are submitted and paid in a timely manner, along with withholding taxes from employee's wages. In addition, you are responsible for preparing and filing a W-2 form for each employee. On top of all the tax responsibilities, you must comply with federal and state business license laws as well. There are a great many advantages for business owners as long as owners are willing to adapt to the roles and responsibilities that come with a successful thriving business. If you need help with understanding business taxation, you can post your legal need on UpCounsel's marketplace.\n\nSome Business Tax Impacts:\n- The business tax rates are cut 20% for C-Corporations (25% for personal service C-Corps)\nand a maximum of 25% for partnerships, S-Corps, and sole proprietorships. However, the\nlower tax rate for pass-through entities does not apply to service sector entities, except to the\nextent the argument can be made that the income results from something other than what\nshould be considered “compensation” to the owners. Therein lies the “rub”, and likely where a\nlot of time and resources will be spent in tax return preparation. - Section 179 limits increase to $5,000,000 with phase out beginning at $20,000,000 of assets\npurchased in one year, for asset purchases between 2018 and 2022. - Limits interest expense to no more than 30% of the business’s taxable income for businesses\nwith more than $25,000,000 of gross receipts. - Reduces the NOL deduction to only 90% of taxable income. - Corporations with earned income parked offshore would be hit with a one-time tax of 12% for\nliquid holdings, and 5% on others. However, they would then be free to bring their earnings\nback to the US tax-free. Additional future earnings would also be taxed at the same rates, and\nwould also be allowed to be repatriated tax-free. - Greatly impacts the tax regime for companies doing business in other countries, and foreign\nowned companies doing business in the US.

LLCs offer several advantages over other types of business entities. For example, they are easy to set up and operate, have fewer formal requirements than corporations, and offer flexible management structures. Additionally, LLCs can have an unlimited number of members and can be owned by individuals, other businesses, or even foreign entities. Overall, LLCs are a popular choice for small businesses and entrepreneurs who want the liability protection of a corporation and the flexibility of a partnership. A corporation is a type of legal entity that is owned by shareholders and managed by a board of directors. The shareholders have limited liability, which means that they are not personally responsible for the company’s debts and legal obligations. Corporations are distinct from their owners and are taxed as separate entities. They are required to file annual tax returns and pay taxes on their profits. Corporations can also issue stock to raise capital, which allows them to expand and grow their business operations. Corporations have a formal management structure, with a board of directors responsible for making strategic decisions and a management team responsible for day-to-day operations. Shareholders elect the board of directors, and the board appoints senior management. There are two main types of corporations: C corporations and S corporations. C corporations are subject to double taxation, meaning that profits are taxed at the corporate level and again when they are distributed to shareholders as dividends. S corporations, on the other hand, are pass-through entities like LLCs, and profits and losses are passed through to the shareholders’ personal tax returns. Overall, corporations are popular among large businesses and those seeking to raise significant capital, as they offer limited liability protection and the ability to issue stock. However, corporations also have more regulatory and compliance requirements than other business entities, which can increase the complexity and cost of operation. Differences between a Business and a Company\nNow that we have defined the terms, let’s look at some of the key differences between a business and a company. One of the key differences between a business and a company is their structural organization. A business can be a sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation, whereas a company is always a legal entity that is registered with the state. Another important difference between a business and a company is their ownership. A business can be owned by one person, two or more people, or a group of shareholders. In contrast, a company is always owned by a group of shareholders. The purpose of a business is to generate profits, while the purpose of a company is to create value for its shareholders. This means that while a business may have a broader range of goals and objectives, a company’s primary goal is to increase its shareholders’ wealth. Businesses can range in size from small mom-and-pop stores to large multinational corporations. Companies, on the other hand, are usually larger than businesses and can range from small startups to global corporations. The Changing Business Landscape\nThe business landscape is constantly evolving, and we are seeing new types of businesses and companies emerge. One of the biggest changes we have seen in recent years is the rise of the gig economy. This refers to a labor market where workers have temporary or freelance jobs, often through online platforms like Uber or Airbnb. Another trend we are seeing is the growing importance of social responsibility and sustainability. Many companies are now focusing on creating value not just for their shareholders, but also for their employees, customers, and the environment. As the business landscape continues to evolve, we can expect to see changes in the way businesses and companies are structured and operated. One potential future trend is the growth of alternative forms of ownership, such as employee-owned businesses or community-owned cooperatives. We may also see more companies and businesses embrace sustainability and social responsibility as a core part of their operations. This could lead to new forms of business models and practices that prioritize the well-being of all stakeholders, not just shareholders. Examples of Companies and Businesses\nTo further illustrate the differences between companies and businesses, let’s take a look at some examples. Example 1: Amazon\nAmazon is a multinational technology company that is registered as a corporation. It is owned by a group of shareholders and has a hierarchical structure with a board of directors, executives, managers, and employees.\n\nTypes of Business Taxes\nNow that you have incorporated your business and have begun to conduct business, there are some other things that you need to keep in mind and follow for keeping your company in a good standing. Moreover, these obligations have to be followed so that you do not end up in court and encounter heavy fines that can cost you more than your company. One such obligation is paying the taxes to the government. There are many types of business taxes out of which you might have to pay a few. The business structure of your company is what determines the taxes that you would have to pay and how you might have to pay them as well. Here are the five general types of business taxes that almost every company might come across:\n- Self-Employment Tax\n- Estimated Taxes\n- Income Tax\n- Excise Tax\n- Employment Taxes\nEach tax type is explained in details below. The SE tax, self-employment tax is a Medicare and social security tax that every individual has to pay for working for themselves. The payments that you would make for the SE tax is added to your coverage under the social security (SS) system. The SS coverage offers you the hospital insurance (Medicare) benefits, survivor benefits, disability benefits, and retirement benefits. Normally, other than the other types of business taxes, you need to pay the self-employment tax and file the Schedule SE (Form 1040) if any of the following applies to you:\n- In case your total earnings from the self-employment were $400 or more. - In case you work for a qualified church-controlled organization or a church (other than a minister) which has chosen an exclusion from the social security and Medicare taxes, you’re subjected to the self-employment tax in case you get $108.28 or more in wages from the organization or church. NOTE: Special laws and exceptions are there for the international organization employees, foreign government employees, state or local government employees, notary public, fishing crew members, or aliens. To know more about the details, it is better to consult a professional lawyer to help you out with these types of business taxes. Normally, you need to pay the taxes on your income (discussed next), along with the self-employment tax, by giving regular payments of estimated tax during the year. There are different rules for different states and it is better to consult with your lawyer to know the details about these types of business taxes. Income tax is the main type of tax that everyone has to pay. Any business except the partnerships (partnerships file the informal return), have to file an annual income tax return. The form that you file would be based on the type of business structure that you have and how your business is organized. For details on the forms you might need, it is recommended to take the help of a professional lawyer to avoid any mistakes. This is one of the types of business taxes where you have to pay as you go, which means that you have to pay the tax when you receive the income or earn during that year. In case you do not pay enough tax or any tax through withholding, you might have to pay the estimated tax as mentioned above. And since everyone is not eligible to pay estimated tax payments, you might not be eligible. In this case, you need to pay the due tax when you file your tax return. Again, to ensure that you are doing it right, consult an accountant or a lawyer to help you with the payment of the various types of business taxes. Even though this is not a tax that everyone might have to pay for, many of you might have to pay at some point of your business cycle. The excise tax is normally paid by the businesses when any purchases have been made on a particular type of goods, like gasoline. Excise taxes are also placed on some activities like wagering or on highway usage by trucks. In any such case, you might come across the following forms which you might need to fill and file with the respective government agency along with paying the applicable tax required:\n- Receive payment for specific services. - Use multiple types of products, equipment, or facilities. - Operate specific types of businesses. - Manufacture or sell specific products. Here is a little more explanation of the forms that you might come across for paying the excise tax in any of the above cases which is one of the important types of business taxes:\nThis form is an Occupational Tax and Registration Return form for Wagering. It is used for the registration of any wagering activity and for paying the federal occupational tax on wagering.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of businesses in the U.S. are not C-corporations subject to the corporate tax. Rather, most businesses—about 95 percent—are “pass-throughs,” which have their income “pass through” to their owners to be taxed under the individual income tax. Pass-through businesses include sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S-corporations. Because these businesses’ decisions are affected by both corporate and individual tax systems, earn a majority of U.S. business income, range in size and complexity, and operate economy-wide in a variety of industries, they represent unusual challenges to tax reform. Both the Trump administration and the 2016 House Republican tax reform plan propose large reductions in taxes paid on business income, including taxes paid by owners of pass-through businesses. For instance, the Trump tax plan proposes reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent and the top tax rate on income earned from pass-through business from 39.6 percent to 15 percent. To help understand the policy considerations surrounding the taxation of pass-through businesses and the implications of potential reforms, here are nine facts about pass-throughs and the current U.S. approach to taxing business. Click on each fact to jump to its discussion. - Most businesses are pass-throughs. Of the 26 million businesses in 2014, 95 percent were pass-throughs, while only 5 percent were C-corporations. - Almost all businesses are small. In 2014, almost 99 percent of businesses, whether pass-through businesses or C-corporations, had $10 million or less in sales or receipts. - Pass-throughs are not necessarily small businesses. A small number of large businesses account for the majority of pass-through profits and economic activity. - Pass through businesses now earn a majority of business income. In the early 1980s, C-corporations produced almost all business income. In 2013, only 44 percent of the income of business owners was earned through C-corporations. - Pass-through businesses pay lower tax rates than C-corporations. The gap between the lower tax rate on pass-throughs and the higher rates faced by C-corporations creates a major incentive for businesses to un-incorporate and to organize as pass-throughs. - The multitude of business types encourages inefficient tax avoidance. With so many options to choose from when determining how to structure a business and whether to distribute business income as profits, wages, or capital gains, business owners have considerable incentive and ability to avoid tax. - The growth of pass-through businesses has eroded corporate and payroll revenues. If the relative shares of pass-through and C-corporate activity were held at 1980 levels, the average tax rate on business income in 2011 would have produced at least $100 billion in additional revenue in 2011 alone. - Pass-through income is primarily earned by high-income individuals. About 70 percent of partnership income accrues to the top 1 percent, compared to less than 50 percent of corporate dividends and 11 percent of wages. - Pass-through businesses are responsible for a significant share of the tax gap. About 41 percent of the tax gap from 2008-2010, or $190 billion, was due to pass-throughs underreporting income and thus paying too little income tax. Fact 1: Most businesses are pass-throughs. Of the 26 million businesses in 2014, 95 percent were pass-throughs, while only 5 percent were C-corporations (Figure 1).1 C-corporations, which include most publicly traded businesses, pay taxes at the corporate level. As a result, the income of C-corporations is potentially taxed twice: once at the corporate level (with a top tax rate of 35 percent) and again when the profits are distributed to shareholders via dividends or capital gains (at rates up to 23.8 percent). Organizing as a C-corporation affords the owner limited liability (that is, the owner’s personal assets are protected against business losses) and facilitates complex financing such as selling shares to the public. In contrast, “pass-throughs” do not pay the corporate tax. Instead, their profits are “passed through” to their owners’ individual tax returns and taxed at the individual rate. - Sole proprietorships are the most common type of pass-through business and represented 43 percent of pass-throughs and 41 percent of all businesses. These companies are operated by a single taxpayer in a wide range of businesses, ranging from babysitters and housekeepers, ride-sharing drivers, construction or handyman services, and even some doctors and lawyers.","passages":[{"passage":"When it comes to setting up corporate structures there are a variety of considerations to bear in mind. There are both commercial and tax implications that need to be considered. The adage that the tax tail should not wag the commercial dog is very true in these situations. However, one of the main commercial considerations in determining the best structure for the business is actually to consider the tax implications, as they will have a big impact on the financials for the business. Setting up a Limited company:\nA Limited company structure provides important protection due to the \"limited liability\" characteristic of companies. By being a Limited liability company it means that the shareholders are protected from loss of their own personal assets. Another advantage of Limited company status is the current favourable taxation treatment of companies compared with sole traders\/individuals. Some problems inherent with a Limited liability structure include that the structure is rather rigid in that incoming or exiting shareholders will have various implications for the business - and there will be taxation implications on the disposal of shares or \"company buy back\" of shares. Limited Liability Partnerships:\nLimited liability partnerships allow for greater flexibility in that profits sharing ratios can be changed dependant on private agreements of the Partners. The main constituational document of the partnership will be the partnership agreement. This will control the way in which the partnership interacts and behaves with its members and the way in which business is conducted by the partnership. An LLP is tax transparent and therefore the taxation of the profits of the partnership fall onto the \"members\" of the LLP. There are a variety of benefits in setting up a corporate group structure - either at the inception of the business or at a future point in time. We have advised many clients on the benefits of setting up a corporate structure such that they can benefit from important tax reliefs such as Substantial Shareholders' exemption on a disposal of part of the business. It is important to liaise with us in advance of making any important decisions as there will often be certain ways of carrying out transactions that will be more beneficial from a taxation perspective.

Failing to comply with tax laws can result in penalties and fines, so it's essential to stay informed about the tax considerations that apply to your business. In this blog post, we will explore some of the key tax considerations that small businesses need to be aware of. The type of business structure you choose, such as sole proprietorship, partnership, LLC or corporation, will affect how your business is taxed. It's essential to understand the tax implications of each business structure and choose the one that best suits your needs. Small businesses can claim deductions for various business expenses, such as office rent, employee salaries, office supplies, and more. Be sure to keep accurate records and receipts of your business expenses to maximize your deductions. Depending on the type of business you run, you may be required to collect sales taxes from customers and remit them to the government. It's important to understand the sales tax laws that apply to your business and to stay current with changes in the tax code. Self-employed individuals and small business owners are often required to pay estimated taxes throughout the year. It's important to understand the rules for estimated taxes and to make timely payments to avoid penalties. As an employer, you are responsible for withholding taxes from your employees' paychecks and remitting them to the government. You must also file the necessary forms with the government to report the taxes you have withheld. Small business owners can take advantage of retirement plans, such as a solo 401(k) or a Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRA, to save for retirement and reduce their tax liabilities.

Whenever you start a business, you will have to select one organizational type from out of all the different business structures. This choice determines how your business will be set up and organized. In most instances, you will probably have to choose between a limited liability company (LLC), a partnership, a corporation, or a sole proprietorship. There are some criteria that you can use to find the business structure that works the best for your purpose. These criteria are:\nThe general rule for this category is that the more dangerous or risky the activity that your business will engage in, the less personal liability you want to have. Both corporations and LLCs allow business owners a type of \"limited liability,\" where anyone seeking claims against the business will have a very hard time placing personal liability on you as the owner. Conversely, if you were to organize your business as a partnership or a sole proprietorship, you could be personally responsible for anything the business did wrong. Expenses and Procedures\nIn general, there is no special paperwork that needs to be filed in order to establish either of these business structures. In addition, there are rarely any fees associated with establishing or maintaining either of these business structures. LLCs and corporations, on the other hand, are almost always more difficult and expensive to establish and maintain. In order to establish a corporation or limited liability company, you must file \"Articles of Incorporation\" with your secretary of state and pay fees associated with the incorporation. The details of the articles of incorporation and the amount of the fee will vary depending upon the state where you set up your business. In addition, when deciding to form a corporation or LLC, the owners of the business must decide which officers to elect to run the company. LLCs and corporations must keep specific and detailed records of any important business decisions, and follow many other formalities that are associated with these business structures. The easiest way to think about the different income tax structures that these business structures will use is to break them into two categories -- one comprised of those business structures where the business owners pay taxes on business profits, and one that includes all business structures where the business owners do not pay taxes on business profits. The first category includes sole proprietorships, partnerships and LLCs. These business structures are often referred to as \"pass-through\" tax entities because the taxes on the business profits and losses pass through to the business owners on their personal income taxes. Business owners of sole proprietorships, partnerships and LLCs must report and pay taxes on all net profits from their business, even if they take no money out of the business' account during the tax year. Unlike the pass through tax businesses, the owners of a corporation do not pay taxes on the net business profits of the corporation. Instead, the business owners of a corporation pay taxes only on the profits they actually take from the corporation in the form of salaries, dividends and bonuses. Because a corporation is a separate tax entity, it must pay taxes on any profits that remain within the company during a tax year, and also on any profits that it pays out in the form of dividends to shareholders. There is a tax benefit to forming your business as a corporation. The owners of a corporation do not pay taxes on any profits that the corporation keeps, and the corporation pays taxes at a lower rate than do some individuals. Structuring a business as a corporation allows a business to sell shares of ownership in the business through stock offerings. This is different than the other three business structures, which do not allow the selling of part of the business through the sale of stocks. Because of this investment scheme, it may allow owners of a corporation to attract investors and retain employees more easily by offering stock. If you never plan on having your business go on sale to the public, however, and don't need the investment incentives to retain employees, you probably do not need to go through the added procedure and cost of forming a corporation. If you desire the limited personal liability that comes from a corporation, you could instead form your business as a LLC. An LLC provides many of the advantages of a corporation while remaining more flexible.

That shift has reduced federal revenues but probably promoted overall investment and a more efficient allocation of resources. Most business receipts—the revenues that businesses receive from sales of goods and services—come from a relatively small number of firms subject to the corporate income tax, called C corporations. However, other organizational forms allow businesses to avoid the corporate tax by passing their profits through to their owners, where they are subject to the individual income tax. Use of those pass-through structures has grown: In 1980, 83 percent of firms passed profits through to their owners for taxation, and they accounted for 14 percent of business receipts; by 2007, those shares had increased to 94 percent and 38 percent, respectively. Organizational forms that provide owners with the same protection from liability for the debts of the firm that the owners of C corporations receive were almost entirely responsible for that growth. Today’s CBO report Taxing Businesses Through the Individual Income Tax examines the size and causes of the shift in organizational structure, the effect it has had on federal revenues, and the potential effects on revenues and investment of various alternative approaches to taxing businesses’ profits.

All taxes, including business activity taxes, are “people taxes” and have an economic impact.3 min read\nBusiness taxation is important to understand. All taxes, including business activity taxes, are “people taxes” and have an economic impact. Since only people can pay taxes, the tax burden ultimately falls on various groups of people. Business taxes include corporate franchise tax, employment tax, excise tax, gross receipts tax, and value added tax, VAT. How Are Applicable Taxes Determined? All firms must pay certain taxes, including:\n- Sales tax\nThe type of business a person owns will determine additional taxes they may pay. For example, insurance, mining and petroleum extraction companies are required to pay additional taxes specifically related to their industries. It is not uncommon for firms to pay a fee for doing business in a particular jurisdiction. What Is a Value-Added Tax? A value-added tax, VAT, also referred to as a goods and service tax is a consumption tax that is placed or assessed incrementally. The amount is based on the increase in value of the good or service at each stage, from production to point of sale. It avoids the double taxation of a direct sales tax because the producer or distributor does not get burdened with the tax. The end consumer ultimately catches the full brunt of the tax. Choosing the Returns You Must File\nThere are several return types and the one you file depends on your business structure. Sole proprietors and any other business structure with a pass-through structure file Form 1040. A pass-through structure allows owners to report business and expenses as part of their personal tax return. If you operate as a C corporation you will submit a copy of the 1120 Form and S corporations will submit the 1120s Form. Both nonprofit organizations and general partnerships will use information returns. Nonprofit organizations will use the 990 Form and general partnerships will use 1065 Form. Business-related returns will vary and may include sales and usage tax, payroll taxes and other specific state and local taxes. Also, the Form 1040-ES will include the estimated tax payments. Again, the tax rates will vary depending on the business structure you operate under and the type of business you have. Sole proprietors will file their return and face normal federal income tax rates on any revenue they generate through their self-employment. These rates can go as high as 39.6% and as low as 10%. This is also applicable to any business owner with a pass-through business structure, such as S corporations and partnerships. Take note, this does not include the 15.3 self-employment tax you may be subject too, nor any state or local taxes. Do All Businesses Incur a Corporate Income Tax? It is most likely that you will incur a corporate income tax if you operate as a C corporation or an LLC. This is based on the amount your corporation earns and essentially, the more you earn the more you pay in taxes. Tax rates start at 15% and go up to as high as 39%. Depending on where you conduct your business, you may have state and local corporate taxes as well. Tax Advantages for Businesses\nA big advantage at tax time for business owners is the opportunity to deduct every single business-related expense. Of course, individuals do not get to write off near as many deductions. For example, as a business owner, you can deduct 50% of any business-related meals and entertainment. In addition, vehicle expenses, home office expenses are all eligible deductions if they are in some way related to your business. This means your deductions can range from paper clips to high-powered computer servers as long as you document and keep your receipts to prove your deductions at tax time. Responsibility to Pay Taxes\nConversely, being your own boss and having huge deductions also comes with having a huge amount of responsibility. You are required to make sure your local, state, and federal taxes are submitted and paid in a timely manner, along with withholding taxes from employee's wages. In addition, you are responsible for preparing and filing a W-2 form for each employee. On top of all the tax responsibilities, you must comply with federal and state business license laws as well. There are a great many advantages for business owners as long as owners are willing to adapt to the roles and responsibilities that come with a successful thriving business.

LLCs offer several advantages over other types of business entities. For example, they are easy to set up and operate, have fewer formal requirements than corporations, and offer flexible management structures. Additionally, LLCs can have an unlimited number of members and can be owned by individuals, other businesses, or even foreign entities. Overall, LLCs are a popular choice for small businesses and entrepreneurs who want the liability protection of a corporation and the flexibility of a partnership. A corporation is a type of legal entity that is owned by shareholders and managed by a board of directors. The shareholders have limited liability, which means that they are not personally responsible for the company’s debts and legal obligations. Corporations are distinct from their owners and are taxed as separate entities. They are required to file annual tax returns and pay taxes on their profits. Corporations can also issue stock to raise capital, which allows them to expand and grow their business operations. Corporations have a formal management structure, with a board of directors responsible for making strategic decisions and a management team responsible for day-to-day operations. Shareholders elect the board of directors, and the board appoints senior management. There are two main types of corporations: C corporations and S corporations. C corporations are subject to double taxation, meaning that profits are taxed at the corporate level and again when they are distributed to shareholders as dividends. S corporations, on the other hand, are pass-through entities like LLCs, and profits and losses are passed through to the shareholders’ personal tax returns. Overall, corporations are popular among large businesses and those seeking to raise significant capital, as they offer limited liability protection and the ability to issue stock. However, corporations also have more regulatory and compliance requirements than other business entities, which can increase the complexity and cost of operation. Differences between a Business and a Company\nNow that we have defined the terms, let’s look at some of the key differences between a business and a company. One of the key differences between a business and a company is their structural organization. A business can be a sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation, whereas a company is always a legal entity that is registered with the state. Another important difference between a business and a company is their ownership. A business can be owned by one person, two or more people, or a group of shareholders. In contrast, a company is always owned by a group of shareholders. The purpose of a business is to generate profits, while the purpose of a company is to create value for its shareholders. This means that while a business may have a broader range of goals and objectives, a company’s primary goal is to increase its shareholders’ wealth. Businesses can range in size from small mom-and-pop stores to large multinational corporations. Companies, on the other hand, are usually larger than businesses and can range from small startups to global corporations. The Changing Business Landscape\nThe business landscape is constantly evolving, and we are seeing new types of businesses and companies emerge. One of the biggest changes we have seen in recent years is the rise of the gig economy. This refers to a labor market where workers have temporary or freelance jobs, often through online platforms like Uber or Airbnb. Another trend we are seeing is the growing importance of social responsibility and sustainability. Many companies are now focusing on creating value not just for their shareholders, but also for their employees, customers, and the environment. As the business landscape continues to evolve, we can expect to see changes in the way businesses and companies are structured and operated. One potential future trend is the growth of alternative forms of ownership, such as employee-owned businesses or community-owned cooperatives. We may also see more companies and businesses embrace sustainability and social responsibility as a core part of their operations. This could lead to new forms of business models and practices that prioritize the well-being of all stakeholders, not just shareholders. Examples of Companies and Businesses\nTo further illustrate the differences between companies and businesses, let’s take a look at some examples. Example 1: Amazon\nAmazon is a multinational technology company that is registered as a corporation. It is owned by a group of shareholders and has a hierarchical structure with a board of directors, executives, managers, and employees.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:10a08f81-77b5-4b1f-aae5-d501393749d6>"]},{"passage":"Types of Business Taxes\nNow that you have incorporated your business and have begun to conduct business, there are some other things that you need to keep in mind and follow for keeping your company in a good standing. Moreover, these obligations have to be followed so that you do not end up in court and encounter heavy fines that can cost you more than your company. One such obligation is paying the taxes to the government. There are many types of business taxes out of which you might have to pay a few. The business structure of your company is what determines the taxes that you would have to pay and how you might have to pay them as well. Here are the five general types of business taxes that almost every company might come across:\n- Self-Employment Tax\n- Estimated Taxes\n- Income Tax\n- Excise Tax\n- Employment Taxes\nEach tax type is explained in details below. The SE tax, self-employment tax is a Medicare and social security tax that every individual has to pay for working for themselves. The payments that you would make for the SE tax is added to your coverage under the social security (SS) system. The SS coverage offers you the hospital insurance (Medicare) benefits, survivor benefits, disability benefits, and retirement benefits. Normally, other than the other types of business taxes, you need to pay the self-employment tax and file the Schedule SE (Form 1040) if any of the following applies to you:\n- In case your total earnings from the self-employment were $400 or more. - In case you work for a qualified church-controlled organization or a church (other than a minister) which has chosen an exclusion from the social security and Medicare taxes, you’re subjected to the self-employment tax in case you get $108.28 or more in wages from the organization or church. NOTE: Special laws and exceptions are there for the international organization employees, foreign government employees, state or local government employees, notary public, fishing crew members, or aliens. To know more about the details, it is better to consult a professional lawyer to help you out with these types of business taxes. Normally, you need to pay the taxes on your income (discussed next), along with the self-employment tax, by giving regular payments of estimated tax during the year. There are different rules for different states and it is better to consult with your lawyer to know the details about these types of business taxes. Income tax is the main type of tax that everyone has to pay. Any business except the partnerships (partnerships file the informal return), have to file an annual income tax return. The form that you file would be based on the type of business structure that you have and how your business is organized. For details on the forms you might need, it is recommended to take the help of a professional lawyer to avoid any mistakes. This is one of the types of business taxes where you have to pay as you go, which means that you have to pay the tax when you receive the income or earn during that year. In case you do not pay enough tax or any tax through withholding, you might have to pay the estimated tax as mentioned above. And since everyone is not eligible to pay estimated tax payments, you might not be eligible. In this case, you need to pay the due tax when you file your tax return. Again, to ensure that you are doing it right, consult an accountant or a lawyer to help you with the payment of the various types of business taxes. Even though this is not a tax that everyone might have to pay for, many of you might have to pay at some point of your business cycle. The excise tax is normally paid by the businesses when any purchases have been made on a particular type of goods, like gasoline. Excise taxes are also placed on some activities like wagering or on highway usage by trucks. In any such case, you might come across the following forms which you might need to fill and file with the respective government agency along with paying the applicable tax required:\n- Receive payment for specific services. - Use multiple types of products, equipment, or facilities. - Operate specific types of businesses. - Manufacture or sell specific products. Here is a little more explanation of the forms that you might come across for paying the excise tax in any of the above cases which is one of the important types of business taxes:\nThis form is an Occupational Tax and Registration Return form for Wagering. It is used for the registration of any wagering activity and for paying the federal occupational tax on wagering.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:d1af696b-767d-41ad-9b88-76724e631017>"]},{"passage":"The overwhelming majority of businesses in the U.S. are not C-corporations subject to the corporate tax. Rather, most businesses—about 95 percent—are “pass-throughs,” which have their income “pass through” to their owners to be taxed under the individual income tax. Pass-through businesses include sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S-corporations. Because these businesses’ decisions are affected by both corporate and individual tax systems, earn a majority of U.S. business income, range in size and complexity, and operate economy-wide in a variety of industries, they represent unusual challenges to tax reform. Both the Trump administration and the 2016 House Republican tax reform plan propose large reductions in taxes paid on business income, including taxes paid by owners of pass-through businesses. For instance, the Trump tax plan proposes reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent and the top tax rate on income earned from pass-through business from 39.6 percent to 15 percent. To help understand the policy considerations surrounding the taxation of pass-through businesses and the implications of potential reforms, here are nine facts about pass-throughs and the current U.S. approach to taxing business. Click on each fact to jump to its discussion. - Most businesses are pass-throughs. Of the 26 million businesses in 2014, 95 percent were pass-throughs, while only 5 percent were C-corporations. - Almost all businesses are small. In 2014, almost 99 percent of businesses, whether pass-through businesses or C-corporations, had $10 million or less in sales or receipts. - Pass-throughs are not necessarily small businesses. A small number of large businesses account for the majority of pass-through profits and economic activity. - Pass through businesses now earn a majority of business income. In the early 1980s, C-corporations produced almost all business income. In 2013, only 44 percent of the income of business owners was earned through C-corporations. - Pass-through businesses pay lower tax rates than C-corporations. The gap between the lower tax rate on pass-throughs and the higher rates faced by C-corporations creates a major incentive for businesses to un-incorporate and to organize as pass-throughs. - The multitude of business types encourages inefficient tax avoidance. With so many options to choose from when determining how to structure a business and whether to distribute business income as profits, wages, or capital gains, business owners have considerable incentive and ability to avoid tax. - The growth of pass-through businesses has eroded corporate and payroll revenues. If the relative shares of pass-through and C-corporate activity were held at 1980 levels, the average tax rate on business income in 2011 would have produced at least $100 billion in additional revenue in 2011 alone. - Pass-through income is primarily earned by high-income individuals. About 70 percent of partnership income accrues to the top 1 percent, compared to less than 50 percent of corporate dividends and 11 percent of wages. - Pass-through businesses are responsible for a significant share of the tax gap. About 41 percent of the tax gap from 2008-2010, or $190 billion, was due to pass-throughs underreporting income and thus paying too little income tax. Fact 1: Most businesses are pass-throughs. Of the 26 million businesses in 2014, 95 percent were pass-throughs, while only 5 percent were C-corporations (Figure 1).1 C-corporations, which include most publicly traded businesses, pay taxes at the corporate level. As a result, the income of C-corporations is potentially taxed twice: once at the corporate level (with a top tax rate of 35 percent) and again when the profits are distributed to shareholders via dividends or capital gains (at rates up to 23.8 percent). Organizing as a C-corporation affords the owner limited liability (that is, the owner’s personal assets are protected against business losses) and facilitates complex financing such as selling shares to the public. In contrast, “pass-throughs” do not pay the corporate tax. Instead, their profits are “passed through” to their owners’ individual tax returns and taxed at the individual rate. - Sole proprietorships are the most common type of pass-through business and represented 43 percent of pass-throughs and 41 percent of all businesses. These companies are operated by a single taxpayer in a wide range of businesses, ranging from babysitters and housekeepers, ride-sharing drivers, construction or handyman services, and even some doctors and lawyers.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:0e013242-fa67-4f99-a801-28e82898cb2f>"]}]}

These include obesity, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, stroke, and heart diseases. Along with adults, many children also suffer from lifestyle disorders. Lack of physical activities, stressful living, and availability of technological resources are the main reasons for such ailments. Diet and exercise tips to follow\nToday, most people live sedentary lifestyles and sit at their desks for several hours a day. Ideally, you must be physically active and sit only while resting. Sitting continuously in front of your laptop, television, or while driving affects the body in many ways, like:\n- Weight gain, as you burn lesser calories\n- Hormonal imbalances\n- Loss of muscle strength and bone weakening\n- Weakened immunity\n- Lower blood circulation\nHere are some tips to reduce the risk of lifestyle-related diseases:\n- Remain active\n- Walk around every hour and during lunch and other breaks\n- Take the stairs instead of the elevator\n- Exercise regularly\n- Include low-intensity cardiovascular training\n- Take up a sport\n- Do yoga and meditation to relieve stress and anxiety\n- Make dietary changes\n- Eat nutritious and well-balanced meals comprising natural fats and proteins\n- Avoid sugar-laden foods like sodas, candies, and pastries\n- Eliminate fried and processed foods from your diet\n- Drink adequate water to remain hydrated\nTreatment costs for critical illness\nThe treatment expenses for critical illness are on the rise due to inflation. Open heart surgery or organ transplant may cost between INR 5 lakh to INR 10 lakh. Cancer treatment may cost in the range of INR 10 lakh to INR 15 lakh. Heart diseases may require INR lakh 3 to INR 5 lakh for treatment. Have you considered how you will meet these expenses in case of a diagnosis of any illness? A critical illness insurance policy is beneficial to combat these expenses. This insurance plan pays a lump sum if you are diagnosed with any covered ailment. You can utilize the money that you receive from this type of health insurance plan for treatment, household expenses, repaying debt, or any other purpose. Before you opt for health coverage, here are a few things to consider:\n- You need to survive for an approximate period of 30 days from the date of diagnosis; this duration may increase or decrease depending on the kind of illness; in case of demise during this tenure, you do not get any cashless health insurance benefits\n- You must know about the waiting period for pre-existing conditions; it may be up to four years, and you need to find the lowest one to ensure the availability of benefits at the earliest\n- You must compare different health insurance like cholesterol medical cover and Covid-19 insurance from different insurers to find a plan that includes the highest number of critical ailments\n- You must inquire about the additional facilities, such as waiver of premiums, hospital cash, and a second e-opinion of a medical practitioner with the same medical insurance plan\nA critical illness plan is a fixed benefit policy and does not cover hospitalization expenses. It pays a fixed amount on a positive diagnosis after the end of the survival period. To cover hospitalization-related expenses, you may buy a mediclaim policy for additional security.\n\nWith regular health insurance plans, you could face considerable out-of-pocket expenses which is why having a critical illness insurance plan can be beneficial. Unlike traditional health insurance, which reimburses the insured or provider for covered claims, critical illness insurance pays you directly if you're diagnosed with a covered critical illness and there are no copays or deductibles. Your insurer typically makes a lump sum cash payment for serious medical issues such as a heart attack, stroke, and cancer. As the number of service sector jobs has risen in developed countries, more and more jobs have become sedentary, presenting a different array of health problems than those associated with manufacturing and the primary sector. Contemporary problems, such as the growing rate of obesity and issues relating to stress and overwork in many countries, have further complicated the interaction between work and health. Believe it or not, “stress can increase your risk of heart disease 2.5-fold—similar to smoking and diabetes,” says Gianos. That’s because chronic stress puts the body into constant fight-or-flight mode, triggering inflammation, high blood pressure and other unhealthy changes. But mindfulness can be a powerful antidote to that modern state of overload. By focusing on our thoughts and sensations, we can learn to control our body’s response to stress. Many governments view occupational health as a social challenge and have formed public organizations to ensure the health and safety of workers. Examples of these include the British Health and Safety Executive and in the United States, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which conducts research on occupational health and safety, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which handles regulation and policy relating to worker safety and health. In addition to safety risks, many jobs also present risks of disease, illness and other long-term health problems. Among the most common occupational diseases are various forms of pneumoconiosis, including silicosis and coal worker's pneumoconiosis (black lung disease). Asthma is another respiratory illness that many workers are vulnerable to. Workers may also be vulnerable to skin diseases, including eczema, dermatitis, urticaria, sunburn, and skin cancer. Other occupational diseases of concern include carpal tunnel syndrome and lead poisoning. Sleep is an essential component to maintaining health. In children, sleep is also vital for growth and development. Ongoing sleep deprivation has been linked to an increased risk for some chronic health problems. In addition, sleep deprivation has been shown to correlate with both increased susceptibility to illness and slower recovery times from illness. In one study, people with chronic insufficient sleep, set as six hours of sleep a night or less, were found to be four times more likely to catch a cold compared to those who reported sleeping for seven hours or more a night. Due to the role of sleep in regulating metabolism, insufficient sleep may also play a role in weight gain or, conversely, in impeding weight loss. Additionally, in 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is the cancer research agency for the World Health Organization, declared that \"shiftwork that involves circadian disruption is probably carcinogenic to humans,\" speaking to the dangers of long-term nighttime work due to its intrusion on sleep. In 2015, the National Sleep Foundation released updated recommendations for sleep duration requirements based on age and concluded that \"Individuals who habitually sleep outside the normal range may be exhibiting signs or symptoms of serious health problems or, if done volitionally, may be compromising their health and well-being.\" Fruits and vegetables work their magic in several ways. First, they provide heart-healthy nutrients, including fiber, antioxidants, potassium, B vitamins, and vitamins A and C, explains Cynthia Sass, a registered dietitian in private practice in Los Angeles and New York. And nonstarchy vegetables—from spinach to broccoli to peppers—are low in calories and carbohydrates too, helping keep weight under control.

We all know how difficult it is to run into medical issues. We have to figure out where do we go to for a hospital, face high doctor consultancy costs and numerous additional fees that occur with different types of cases (especially emergency ones). But there is a way to help yourself prepare for these types of situations through what most people know as an “HMO.”\nAn HMO, or health maintenance organization, acts as a service for you to access its list of available doctors and clinics and cover most (if not all) of your medical-related costs. In exchange for this service, the HMO charges a yearly premium or fee. As long as you use their list of accredited doctors and clinics, you can find your medical needs more or less covered and settled. An HMO can serve as one of the benefits for employees who work in private companies. A company may offer it as a perk by covering the whole cost of the HMO per employee (no salary deduction). Some companies even cover the HMO of at least one dependent per employee.ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nHow does this differ from health insurance or PhilHealth?CONTINUE READING BELOWRecommended Videos\nType of medical coverage: HMO\nService provider: HMO companies (Medicard, Maxicare, Pacific Cross, etc.) Estimated cost: P500 to upwards of P60,000\nStandard benefits: Outpatient, inpatient, emergency, preventive (only with accredited\/associated hospitals\/clinics of the HMO)\nTransmittal of financial assistance: The accredited hospital or clinic will charge your bill against the consumable limit or amount provided by the HMO.

Think of your standard consultation with your doctor where they prescribe certain medication — that is an outpatient treatment. These are services that require the individual to stay in the hospital for a period of 24 hours or more, with any additional in-hospital needs included. Inpatient services are applicable to situations in which quarantine or extended stay is required for monitoring, as well as situations where certain procedures are needed that take longer than one day to execute. These often fall under situations wherein an individual utilizes the emergency room of various hospitals. Depending on the case, these emergency visits can be covered by your medical plan.ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nHow to decide on the HMO you need\nThe goal of these various medical coverage plans are to make your next medical situation as easy as possible. Health insurance provides the largest amount of benefits (albeit with comparatively high premiums), and PhilHealth provides the most standard service of medical discount on a basic premium (though limited in coverage). An HMO then stands as a comprehensive medical plan that can work towards what you need the most as an individual based on cost\/premium, coverage, and healthcare providers. (If you are employed and HMO is one of the benefits, the company decides of the HMO.) The cost of HMOs is varied — these prices can be as low as P500 for a year’s coverage up to P15,000 in medical consumable benefits.\n\nMy goal is to provide personalized care of critical illness in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team.

When uninsured older Americans became ill, they only had a handful of options. They could empty their life savings, they could rely on help from friends and family, or they could suffer without proper care. All of that changed when President Lyndon Johnson signed the Social Security Amendments of 1965 into law. Suddenly, there was a new option for millions of older Americans who couldn’t afford the high costs of health insurance or paying out-of-pocket. Over the past 55 years, Medicare has provided a lifeline to families across the United States, making healthcare more affordable, offering important end-of-life care, and even lowering the national poverty rate. But today’s Medicare is not identical to that which was signed into law in 1965. Most now feel confused when trying to have Medicare explained. It is very difficult to understand for those that are coming into Medicare for the first time. The past five decades have seen major changes and additions to the Medicare system. Today, Medicare is broken up into four major parts, signified by the letters A, B, C, and D.\nOriginal Medicare vs. Medicare Advantage\nFor anyone new to Medicare, it’s essential to understand each part and what it covers. But before we can look at each individual part, it’s important to recognize that Medicare is broken up into two larger categories: Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage. Medicare Parts A and B are known as Original Medicare because they function the way Medicare was originally setup, with the federal government paying health care costs directly. Medicare Parts C (also known as Medicare Advantage) and D involve private health insurance companies contracting with Medicare to provide benefits to customers. Instead of looking at the differences between these two approaches here, we’ll note them as we examine each individual part. There are a lot of pieces when having Medicare explained. So, let’s begin by looking at Medicare’s first program: Part A. It's Easier if I Explain it to You:\nMedicare Part A: Hospital & Hospice Insurance\nMedicare Part A covers emergency vehicle trips and hospital stays, including a hospital room, food, and any necessary testing. As of January 1, 2020, patients need to pay a $1,408 deductible at the beginning of their stay and Medicare will cover the next 60 days. After that, patients will be required to pay a copay of $335 per day for days 61 through 90. If a patient’s stay extends past the 90 day mark, they must tap into their ‘lifetime reserve days’, a set number of days they can use throughout their lifetime that require a $670 copayment. Besides hospital stays, Medicare Part A also covers rehabilitation in a skilled nursing facility for 20 days. Patients can remain in a rehab facility for up to 80 days after this for a copayment of $167.50. This gives injured and ill older Americans the ability to get back on their feet and re-acclimated to normal life before heading home – without draining their life savings. Finally, Medicare Part A covers end-of-life care through a variety of hospice benefits. Terminally ill patients with less than six months to live can receive pain relief medication, symptom control prescriptions, and grief counseling. And Medicare Part A provides these benefits at no cost. The only end-of-life charges that someone with Medicare Part A may incur are outpatient drugs or respite care. To apply for premium-free Medicare Part A, someone must be 65 or older and paid Medicare taxes for at least 10 years. Those who haven’t paid Medicare taxes for that long (and don’t have a spouse who has either) can buy into the program at a reasonable cost. In addition, anyone who’s under 65 and has received Social Security disability benefits for two years or who is a kidney dialysis or transplant patient can receive Medicare Part A without paying premiums. Part A covers inpatient hospital expenses like surgeries. Part B covers outpatient medical expenses like doctor visits. What Does Medicare Part B Cover? Medicare Part B covers a variety of medical procedures not covered under Part A. Most of the things covered under Part B fall under outpatient procedures.\n\nRecovery after Critical Care Booklet\nIt is recognised that recovering from critical illness does not end when you are discharged from Critical Care. For some people recovery can go on for some time following discharge home. There is a lot of information in this booklet and it is likely you will only have a few of the problems highlighted. We hope you can use it as a resource to pick out the areas where you require some information, reassurance and advice.\n\n8.When a nurse is able to work effectively in more than one care area (e.g., general medical-surgical, and cardiac care unit), the nurse is said to be\nIn an attempt the make the most effective use of available personnel, nurses may be cross-trained to work skillfully in two or more specialty care areas. A skill mix is the ratio of RNs to LPNs and assistive personnel to deliver the highest quality care while controlling cost. 9.An applicant was denied employment with a health care agency because she is a recovering alcoholic. This action by the agency violates the\na.Age Discrimination and Employment Act. b.Americans with Disabilities Act. c.Civil Rights Act. d.Occupational Safety and Health Act. In 1990 the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed to eliminate discrimination against persons with physical or mental disabilities. The Age Discrimination and Employment Act protects individuals over the age of 65. The Civil Rights Act protects individuals from employment discrimination on the basis of qualifications unrelated to job performance (such as race) and promotes employment based on ability and merit. The Occupational Safety and Health Act requires places of employment to be free of hazards and requires they write and enact safety policies. 10.A planned program of loss prevention and liability control best defines\nRisk management is a planned program of loss prevention to identify and analyze risks in an effort to reduce accidents and injuries. Client satisfaction data are usually collected after a client is discharged from a hospital or other care setting. Quality assurance is a multi-leveled plan with components such as strategic planning, budgeting, performance improvement, and other elements. A clinical pathway is a plan that directs client care and recovery from predictable problems. Chapter 7: Critical Care\n1.The population that is increasingly using critical care units and needing specialized nursing care is the population of\nc.underserved pregnant women. Clients needing critical care do span the life span; however, those ages 65 and older comprise an increasing number of such clients. Of all hospital beds, more than 50% are filled with the elderly. The physiologic changes that accompany aging, plus chronic conditions seen in this age group, lead to an increased need for critical care beds. 2.The ICU nurse planning care for a critically ill client tries to arrange care to minimize the most disruptive stressor for the client, which is\na.alteration in sleep. b.fear of the unknown. d.sense of isolation. There are many stressors to the ICU client, but alteration in sleep patterns supercedes all the other options. 3.Critical care units (CCUs) have been developed in almost all hospitals because such units\na.allow for concentration of expert personnel. b.can offer special services to the family. d.separate the seriously ill from the other clients. The CCU offers a space in which a concentration of expert personnel can be assigned to monitor and apply highly technological machines such as ventilators. The concentration of personnel does not reduce cost. 4.The nurse admitting clients to the critical care unit understands that priority clients for this area are those who need\na.a cleaner environment to prevent nosocomial infections. b.continuous physiologic monitoring. c.frequent vital sign checks. d.private rooms conducive to rest and sleep. 5. The nurse admitting clients to an intensive care unit understands that research demonstrates best client outcomes when clients\na.are in an area that allows liberal family visitation. b.have consistent nurses caring for them. c.have state of the art physiologic monitoring. d.receive multidisciplinary care led by an intensivist. Studies showed a 30% reduction in intensive care unit stay when care was delivered by an intensivist-lead multidisciplinary team as opposed to an attending physician. 6.A nurse who is acting in a manner that respects and supports the client’s and family’s basic rights, values, and beliefs is functioning in which professional role? See Box 7-3 for more description of advocacy in critical care. A nurse functioning in the caregiver role provides bedside care. A critical thinker evaluates all options and chooses the best response when faced with a dilemma. A manager coordinates care. 7.A nurse working in critical care would plan interactions with clients’ families based on the understanding that families most need\nStudies consistently show that the family’s need for knowledge is consistent. While all options are valid, need-to-know is most important.\n\nDealing with a serious illnessShow more\nDealing with a serious illness in the family\nIf someone in your family develops a serious illness they may be unable to work, and money issues can arise. This type of event can be extremely stressful as medical expenses and regular household bills will need to be paid, and it’s often hard to determine how long it could be until they’re well enough to work again. To support your loved one through this difficult time it’s a good idea to help them to put in place a plan to manage their finances. If money is needed to assist the person through this crisis, there are a few different options that can be considered:\n- Review the insurances they hold – if they have trauma cover or health insurance they may be able to claim back a number of expenses. - Check if they have KiwiSaver – they may be eligible for an early withdrawal from their savings due to their ill health and financial circumstances. - Ask them if they have any savings that could be used to help cover costs. - If your loved one doesn’t have any other means of income, and is too sick to work, they could look at applying for government assistance, see the Work and Income website for more information\nSupporting someone who is terminally illShow more\nIf someone you love becomes terminally ill, it’s important that they’re given the opportunity to make arrangements for their estate while they’re still able. This may include reviewing their:\n- life insurance policy - to ensure that loved ones are taken care of if something should happen\n- will - to ensure they’re comfortable with how their assets and savings will be divided up among their nominated beneficiaries. - funeral arrangements - if they choose they can make requests for how the funeral and burial should be carried out. Farewelling a loved oneShow more\nWhen a loved one passes away there are a number of arrangements you’ll need to make. Below are a list of steps you can follow to ensure you’re prepared:\n- Look for any instructions that your loved one may have left (including a funeral policy). - Arrange for a death certificate to be issued by a doctor, you’ll need this later on\n- Start making funeral plans; remember to consider guests that may have to travel a long way to attend. - Tell your friends, relatives and colleagues. The funeral director may be able to help with the death certificate, notifications, and give advice to help you deal with other details. If all this feels overwhelming, it’s a good idea to get help from a friend or family member so you can share the load. Planning for funeral costsShow more\nFuneral costs vary depending on the kind of service and funeral company you use. It’s a good idea to check for funeral preferences in the deceased’s will. Also, ask your funeral director for a detailed quote to understand costs up front. Here are some of the costs you need to consider when planning a funeral:\n- death certificate\n- funeral director fees\n- cemetery plot\n- other expenses, eg. celebrant, clergy, flowers, press notices, the wake. Private health, sickness, accident or life insurance policies may help to pay for funeral and other expenses. If the person who has died had personal insurance, call their insurance company to check what they are covered for in their policy. You may find that the person who has passed away has paid for their funeral in advance. If you think that the deceased may have prepaid their funeral expenses, but cannot find the paper work, talk to their solicitor, or the executor of their will. Settling propertyShow more\nMost people have a will drawn up to inform their loved ones how to divide up their money and possessions after their death. The executor of the will is responsible for distributing the person’s money and assets to those named in the will. People who are names in the will are known as 'beneficiaries'. Generally assets can only be distributed after debts are paid, and once the courts have granted 'probate' or validated the will. The executor will need a number of documents to enable them to administer the will. Try to gather these documents together as soon as possible:\n- banking records\n- credit, charge and store cards\n- taxation records\n- superannuation records\n- records of investments. If there is no will the estate is shared under a formula set by law. The financial effect of a partner passing awayShow more\nIt’s never easy when a partner passes away, especially if they’ve been the one looking after your finances.\n\nWhen people ask me what I do, I always need to take a little time to think. Partly because STP is a mix of so many varied experiences that every week is different to the previous one, and partly because my own understanding of my specialism keeps evolving as I move through these experiences. When I first applied for this course, I thought I had a reasonable understanding of what cancer genomics was. But now I see how naive I was and that three years is not anywhere near enough time to fully comprehend this very diverse and quickly developing area of science. So summarising it all in a few paragraphs will be a challenge but… let’s give it a go! Critical Care Science in the Wider Context\nCritical Care Science (CCS) is one of the smaller STP specialisms but deals with one of the most complex patient populations. Critical care patients range from elective cardiac surgery patients to major trauma and acute\/chronic medical conditions. Critical care refers to specialised care for patients with life-threatening conditions; typically compromising of one or more organs that are failing. This level of care may be delivered in A+E, Intensive Care, High Dependency or specialist wards, e.g. long term ventilation. While a lot of the STP specialisms focus on a particular organ system or on a particular grouping of investigative techniques, the skills of CCS cover a holistic approach to clinical care, incorporating all areas of medicine and technology. Genetic counsellors see individuals and families to discuss genetic conditions that are present, or are thought to be present, in their family. Information about an individual’s personal medical history and their family history is taken into account when determining the likelihood of a genetic condition running in a family.\n\nThis is the most important component in the entire course. In this book, you will discover how you can revamp your body’s vital defenses against disease and fine-tune your understanding of all things disease related without requiring a PHD in medical science or surgery. Here’s what you will discover in the primary section of the course:\nWhy Mainstream Solutions Are Simply Not Working (Page 7) – Discover the main reason why every penny spent on curing is far less valuable compared to preventive health and how you can save time, energy, and potentially thousands of dollars that might otherwise have gone to expensive reactive health care (those hospital beds are not cheap!)

These include obesity, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, stroke, and heart diseases. Along with adults, many children also suffer from lifestyle disorders. Lack of physical activities, stressful living, and availability of technological resources are the main reasons for such ailments. Diet and exercise tips to follow\nToday, most people live sedentary lifestyles and sit at their desks for several hours a day. Ideally, you must be physically active and sit only while resting. Sitting continuously in front of your laptop, television, or while driving affects the body in many ways, like:\n- Weight gain, as you burn lesser calories\n- Hormonal imbalances\n- Loss of muscle strength and bone weakening\n- Weakened immunity\n- Lower blood circulation\nHere are some tips to reduce the risk of lifestyle-related diseases:\n- Remain active\n- Walk around every hour and during lunch and other breaks\n- Take the stairs instead of the elevator\n- Exercise regularly\n- Include low-intensity cardiovascular training\n- Take up a sport\n- Do yoga and meditation to relieve stress and anxiety\n- Make dietary changes\n- Eat nutritious and well-balanced meals comprising natural fats and proteins\n- Avoid sugar-laden foods like sodas, candies, and pastries\n- Eliminate fried and processed foods from your diet\n- Drink adequate water to remain hydrated\nTreatment costs for critical illness\nThe treatment expenses for critical illness are on the rise due to inflation. Open heart surgery or organ transplant may cost between INR 5 lakh to INR 10 lakh. Cancer treatment may cost in the range of INR 10 lakh to INR 15 lakh. Heart diseases may require INR lakh 3 to INR 5 lakh for treatment. Have you considered how you will meet these expenses in case of a diagnosis of any illness? A critical illness insurance policy is beneficial to combat these expenses. This insurance plan pays a lump sum if you are diagnosed with any covered ailment. You can utilize the money that you receive from this type of health insurance plan for treatment, household expenses, repaying debt, or any other purpose. Before you opt for health coverage, here are a few things to consider:\n- You need to survive for an approximate period of 30 days from the date of diagnosis; this duration may increase or decrease depending on the kind of illness; in case of demise during this tenure, you do not get any cashless health insurance benefits\n- You must know about the waiting period for pre-existing conditions; it may be up to four years, and you need to find the lowest one to ensure the availability of benefits at the earliest\n- You must compare different health insurance like cholesterol medical cover and Covid-19 insurance from different insurers to find a plan that includes the highest number of critical ailments\n- You must inquire about the additional facilities, such as waiver of premiums, hospital cash, and a second e-opinion of a medical practitioner with the same medical insurance plan\nA critical illness plan is a fixed benefit policy and does not cover hospitalization expenses. It pays a fixed amount on a positive diagnosis after the end of the survival period. To cover hospitalization-related expenses, you may buy a mediclaim policy for additional security.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:755f5b18-833c-48b3-a191-46baae9c64c7>"]},{"passage":"With regular health insurance plans, you could face considerable out-of-pocket expenses which is why having a critical illness insurance plan can be beneficial. Unlike traditional health insurance, which reimburses the insured or provider for covered claims, critical illness insurance pays you directly if you're diagnosed with a covered critical illness and there are no copays or deductibles. Your insurer typically makes a lump sum cash payment for serious medical issues such as a heart attack, stroke, and cancer. As the number of service sector jobs has risen in developed countries, more and more jobs have become sedentary, presenting a different array of health problems than those associated with manufacturing and the primary sector. Contemporary problems, such as the growing rate of obesity and issues relating to stress and overwork in many countries, have further complicated the interaction between work and health. Believe it or not, “stress can increase your risk of heart disease 2.5-fold—similar to smoking and diabetes,” says Gianos. That’s because chronic stress puts the body into constant fight-or-flight mode, triggering inflammation, high blood pressure and other unhealthy changes. But mindfulness can be a powerful antidote to that modern state of overload. By focusing on our thoughts and sensations, we can learn to control our body’s response to stress. Many governments view occupational health as a social challenge and have formed public organizations to ensure the health and safety of workers. Examples of these include the British Health and Safety Executive and in the United States, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which conducts research on occupational health and safety, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which handles regulation and policy relating to worker safety and health. In addition to safety risks, many jobs also present risks of disease, illness and other long-term health problems. Among the most common occupational diseases are various forms of pneumoconiosis, including silicosis and coal worker's pneumoconiosis (black lung disease). Asthma is another respiratory illness that many workers are vulnerable to. Workers may also be vulnerable to skin diseases, including eczema, dermatitis, urticaria, sunburn, and skin cancer. Other occupational diseases of concern include carpal tunnel syndrome and lead poisoning. Sleep is an essential component to maintaining health. In children, sleep is also vital for growth and development. Ongoing sleep deprivation has been linked to an increased risk for some chronic health problems. In addition, sleep deprivation has been shown to correlate with both increased susceptibility to illness and slower recovery times from illness. In one study, people with chronic insufficient sleep, set as six hours of sleep a night or less, were found to be four times more likely to catch a cold compared to those who reported sleeping for seven hours or more a night. Due to the role of sleep in regulating metabolism, insufficient sleep may also play a role in weight gain or, conversely, in impeding weight loss. Additionally, in 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is the cancer research agency for the World Health Organization, declared that \"shiftwork that involves circadian disruption is probably carcinogenic to humans,\" speaking to the dangers of long-term nighttime work due to its intrusion on sleep. In 2015, the National Sleep Foundation released updated recommendations for sleep duration requirements based on age and concluded that \"Individuals who habitually sleep outside the normal range may be exhibiting signs or symptoms of serious health problems or, if done volitionally, may be compromising their health and well-being.\" Fruits and vegetables work their magic in several ways. First, they provide heart-healthy nutrients, including fiber, antioxidants, potassium, B vitamins, and vitamins A and C, explains Cynthia Sass, a registered dietitian in private practice in Los Angeles and New York. And nonstarchy vegetables—from spinach to broccoli to peppers—are low in calories and carbohydrates too, helping keep weight under control. Not to mention, veggies supply prebiotics, nondigestible carbs that serve as food for beneficial probiotic bacteria.

We all know how difficult it is to run into medical issues. We have to figure out where do we go to for a hospital, face high doctor consultancy costs and numerous additional fees that occur with different types of cases (especially emergency ones). But there is a way to help yourself prepare for these types of situations through what most people know as an “HMO.”\nAn HMO, or health maintenance organization, acts as a service for you to access its list of available doctors and clinics and cover most (if not all) of your medical-related costs. In exchange for this service, the HMO charges a yearly premium or fee. As long as you use their list of accredited doctors and clinics, you can find your medical needs more or less covered and settled. An HMO can serve as one of the benefits for employees who work in private companies. A company may offer it as a perk by covering the whole cost of the HMO per employee (no salary deduction). Some companies even cover the HMO of at least one dependent per employee.ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nHow does this differ from health insurance or PhilHealth?CONTINUE READING BELOWRecommended Videos\nType of medical coverage: HMO\nService provider: HMO companies (Medicard, Maxicare, Pacific Cross, etc.) Estimated cost: P500 to upwards of P60,000\nStandard benefits: Outpatient, inpatient, emergency, preventive (only with accredited\/associated hospitals\/clinics of the HMO)\nTransmittal of financial assistance: The accredited hospital or clinic will charge your bill against the consumable limit or amount provided by the HMO.

These are services that require the individual to stay in the hospital for a period of 24 hours or more, with any additional in-hospital needs included. Inpatient services are applicable to situations in which quarantine or extended stay is required for monitoring, as well as situations where certain procedures are needed that take longer than one day to execute. These often fall under situations wherein an individual utilizes the emergency room of various hospitals. Depending on the case, these emergency visits can be covered by your medical plan.ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\nHow to decide on the HMO you need\nThe goal of these various medical coverage plans are to make your next medical situation as easy as possible. Health insurance provides the largest amount of benefits (albeit with comparatively high premiums), and PhilHealth provides the most standard service of medical discount on a basic premium (though limited in coverage). An HMO then stands as a comprehensive medical plan that can work towards what you need the most as an individual based on cost\/premium, coverage, and healthcare providers. (If you are employed and HMO is one of the benefits, the company decides of the HMO.) The cost of HMOs is varied — these prices can be as low as P500 for a year’s coverage up to P15,000 in medical consumable benefits.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:9806b940-697d-46a2-8f9c-db3f030b69b6>"]},{"passage":"My goal is to provide personalized care of critical illness in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team.

When uninsured older Americans became ill, they only had a handful of options. They could empty their life savings, they could rely on help from friends and family, or they could suffer without proper care. All of that changed when President Lyndon Johnson signed the Social Security Amendments of 1965 into law. Suddenly, there was a new option for millions of older Americans who couldn’t afford the high costs of health insurance or paying out-of-pocket. Over the past 55 years, Medicare has provided a lifeline to families across the United States, making healthcare more affordable, offering important end-of-life care, and even lowering the national poverty rate. But today’s Medicare is not identical to that which was signed into law in 1965. Most now feel confused when trying to have Medicare explained. It is very difficult to understand for those that are coming into Medicare for the first time. The past five decades have seen major changes and additions to the Medicare system. Today, Medicare is broken up into four major parts, signified by the letters A, B, C, and D.\nOriginal Medicare vs. Medicare Advantage\nFor anyone new to Medicare, it’s essential to understand each part and what it covers. But before we can look at each individual part, it’s important to recognize that Medicare is broken up into two larger categories: Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage. Medicare Parts A and B are known as Original Medicare because they function the way Medicare was originally setup, with the federal government paying health care costs directly. Medicare Parts C (also known as Medicare Advantage) and D involve private health insurance companies contracting with Medicare to provide benefits to customers. Instead of looking at the differences between these two approaches here, we’ll note them as we examine each individual part. There are a lot of pieces when having Medicare explained. So, let’s begin by looking at Medicare’s first program: Part A. It's Easier if I Explain it to You:\nMedicare Part A: Hospital & Hospice Insurance\nMedicare Part A covers emergency vehicle trips and hospital stays, including a hospital room, food, and any necessary testing. As of January 1, 2020, patients need to pay a $1,408 deductible at the beginning of their stay and Medicare will cover the next 60 days. After that, patients will be required to pay a copay of $335 per day for days 61 through 90. If a patient’s stay extends past the 90 day mark, they must tap into their ‘lifetime reserve days’, a set number of days they can use throughout their lifetime that require a $670 copayment. Besides hospital stays, Medicare Part A also covers rehabilitation in a skilled nursing facility for 20 days. Patients can remain in a rehab facility for up to 80 days after this for a copayment of $167.50. This gives injured and ill older Americans the ability to get back on their feet and re-acclimated to normal life before heading home – without draining their life savings. Finally, Medicare Part A covers end-of-life care through a variety of hospice benefits. Terminally ill patients with less than six months to live can receive pain relief medication, symptom control prescriptions, and grief counseling. And Medicare Part A provides these benefits at no cost. The only end-of-life charges that someone with Medicare Part A may incur are outpatient drugs or respite care. To apply for premium-free Medicare Part A, someone must be 65 or older and paid Medicare taxes for at least 10 years. Those who haven’t paid Medicare taxes for that long (and don’t have a spouse who has either) can buy into the program at a reasonable cost. In addition, anyone who’s under 65 and has received Social Security disability benefits for two years or who is a kidney dialysis or transplant patient can receive Medicare Part A without paying premiums. Part A covers inpatient hospital expenses like surgeries. Part B covers outpatient medical expenses like doctor visits. What Does Medicare Part B Cover? Medicare Part B covers a variety of medical procedures not covered under Part A. Most of the things covered under Part B fall under outpatient procedures.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e32819ac-6a39-4cc8-a5ed-46449b9de4f2>"]},{"passage":"Recovery after Critical Care Booklet\nIt is recognised that recovering from critical illness does not end when you are discharged from Critical Care.

The Civil Rights Act protects individuals from employment discrimination on the basis of qualifications unrelated to job performance (such as race) and promotes employment based on ability and merit. The Occupational Safety and Health Act requires places of employment to be free of hazards and requires they write and enact safety policies. 10.A planned program of loss prevention and liability control best defines\nRisk management is a planned program of loss prevention to identify and analyze risks in an effort to reduce accidents and injuries. Client satisfaction data are usually collected after a client is discharged from a hospital or other care setting. Quality assurance is a multi-leveled plan with components such as strategic planning, budgeting, performance improvement, and other elements. A clinical pathway is a plan that directs client care and recovery from predictable problems. Chapter 7: Critical Care\n1.The population that is increasingly using critical care units and needing specialized nursing care is the population of\nc.underserved pregnant women. Clients needing critical care do span the life span; however, those ages 65 and older comprise an increasing number of such clients. Of all hospital beds, more than 50% are filled with the elderly. The physiologic changes that accompany aging, plus chronic conditions seen in this age group, lead to an increased need for critical care beds. 2.The ICU nurse planning care for a critically ill client tries to arrange care to minimize the most disruptive stressor for the client, which is\na.alteration in sleep. b.fear of the unknown. d.sense of isolation. There are many stressors to the ICU client, but alteration in sleep patterns supercedes all the other options. 3.Critical care units (CCUs) have been developed in almost all hospitals because such units\na.allow for concentration of expert personnel. b.can offer special services to the family. d.separate the seriously ill from the other clients. The CCU offers a space in which a concentration of expert personnel can be assigned to monitor and apply highly technological machines such as ventilators. The concentration of personnel does not reduce cost. 4.The nurse admitting clients to the critical care unit understands that priority clients for this area are those who need\na.a cleaner environment to prevent nosocomial infections. b.continuous physiologic monitoring. c.frequent vital sign checks. d.private rooms conducive to rest and sleep. 5. The nurse admitting clients to an intensive care unit understands that research demonstrates best client outcomes when clients\na.are in an area that allows liberal family visitation. b.have consistent nurses caring for them. c.have state of the art physiologic monitoring. d.receive multidisciplinary care led by an intensivist. Studies showed a 30% reduction in intensive care unit stay when care was delivered by an intensivist-lead multidisciplinary team as opposed to an attending physician. 6.A nurse who is acting in a manner that respects and supports the client’s and family’s basic rights, values, and beliefs is functioning in which professional role? See Box 7-3 for more description of advocacy in critical care. A nurse functioning in the caregiver role provides bedside care. A critical thinker evaluates all options and chooses the best response when faced with a dilemma. A manager coordinates care. 7.A nurse working in critical care would plan interactions with clients’ families based on the understanding that families most need\nStudies consistently show that the family’s need for knowledge is consistent.

This type of event can be extremely stressful as medical expenses and regular household bills will need to be paid, and it’s often hard to determine how long it could be until they’re well enough to work again. To support your loved one through this difficult time it’s a good idea to help them to put in place a plan to manage their finances. If money is needed to assist the person through this crisis, there are a few different options that can be considered:\n- Review the insurances they hold – if they have trauma cover or health insurance they may be able to claim back a number of expenses. - Check if they have KiwiSaver – they may be eligible for an early withdrawal from their savings due to their ill health and financial circumstances. - Ask them if they have any savings that could be used to help cover costs. - If your loved one doesn’t have any other means of income, and is too sick to work, they could look at applying for government assistance, see the Work and Income website for more information\nSupporting someone who is terminally illShow more\nIf someone you love becomes terminally ill, it’s important that they’re given the opportunity to make arrangements for their estate while they’re still able. This may include reviewing their:\n- life insurance policy - to ensure that loved ones are taken care of if something should happen\n- will - to ensure they’re comfortable with how their assets and savings will be divided up among their nominated beneficiaries. - funeral arrangements - if they choose they can make requests for how the funeral and burial should be carried out. Farewelling a loved oneShow more\nWhen a loved one passes away there are a number of arrangements you’ll need to make. Below are a list of steps you can follow to ensure you’re prepared:\n- Look for any instructions that your loved one may have left (including a funeral policy). - Arrange for a death certificate to be issued by a doctor, you’ll need this later on\n- Start making funeral plans; remember to consider guests that may have to travel a long way to attend. - Tell your friends, relatives and colleagues. The funeral director may be able to help with the death certificate, notifications, and give advice to help you deal with other details. If all this feels overwhelming, it’s a good idea to get help from a friend or family member so you can share the load. Planning for funeral costsShow more\nFuneral costs vary depending on the kind of service and funeral company you use. It’s a good idea to check for funeral preferences in the deceased’s will. Also, ask your funeral director for a detailed quote to understand costs up front. Here are some of the costs you need to consider when planning a funeral:\n- death certificate\n- funeral director fees\n- cemetery plot\n- other expenses, eg. celebrant, clergy, flowers, press notices, the wake. Private health, sickness, accident or life insurance policies may help to pay for funeral and other expenses. If the person who has died had personal insurance, call their insurance company to check what they are covered for in their policy. You may find that the person who has passed away has paid for their funeral in advance. If you think that the deceased may have prepaid their funeral expenses, but cannot find the paper work, talk to their solicitor, or the executor of their will. Settling propertyShow more\nMost people have a will drawn up to inform their loved ones how to divide up their money and possessions after their death. The executor of the will is responsible for distributing the person’s money and assets to those named in the will. People who are names in the will are known as 'beneficiaries'. Generally assets can only be distributed after debts are paid, and once the courts have granted 'probate' or validated the will. The executor will need a number of documents to enable them to administer the will. Try to gather these documents together as soon as possible:\n- banking records\n- credit, charge and store cards\n- taxation records\n- superannuation records\n- records of investments. If there is no will the estate is shared under a formula set by law.

Partly because STP is a mix of so many varied experiences that every week is different to the previous one, and partly because my own understanding of my specialism keeps evolving as I move through these experiences. When I first applied for this course, I thought I had a reasonable understanding of what cancer genomics was. But now I see how naive I was and that three years is not anywhere near enough time to fully comprehend this very diverse and quickly developing area of science. So summarising it all in a few paragraphs will be a challenge but… let’s give it a go! Critical Care Science in the Wider Context\nCritical Care Science (CCS) is one of the smaller STP specialisms but deals with one of the most complex patient populations. Critical care patients range from elective cardiac surgery patients to major trauma and acute\/chronic medical conditions. Critical care refers to specialised care for patients with life-threatening conditions; typically compromising of one or more organs that are failing. This level of care may be delivered in A+E, Intensive Care, High Dependency or specialist wards, e.g. long term ventilation. While a lot of the STP specialisms focus on a particular organ system or on a particular grouping of investigative techniques, the skills of CCS cover a holistic approach to clinical care, incorporating all areas of medicine and technology. Genetic counsellors see individuals and families to discuss genetic conditions that are present, or are thought to be present, in their family. Information about an individual’s personal medical history and their family history is taken into account when determining the likelihood of a genetic condition running in a family.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:0be89ca1-7f33-4f68-bd90-3f219782383e>"]},{"passage":"This is the most important component in the entire course.
