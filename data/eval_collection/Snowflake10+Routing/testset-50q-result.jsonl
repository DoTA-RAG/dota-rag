My love for Polish pottery began with my own collection, which grew until I replaced most of my tableware with it. After receiving many compliments and buying a lot of pieces as gifts for friends and family, I decided to spread my love for Polish pottery and Groshek Pottery was born. Groshek (or groszek) means \"polka dot\" in Polish, which reflects the many beautiful spotty designs that Polish pottery is renowned for. What is Polish pottery? Every piece of Polish pottery is handmade and hand-decorated using stamps and brushes. It comes in hundreds of shapes, with patterns ranging from classic dots and “peacock eyes” to more intricate “artistic” or “UNIKAT” patterns. My pottery comes from Zaklady Ceramiczne “Boleslawiec”, which is one of the biggest manufacturers in the region and whose tradition goes back to the 19th century. Caring for your pottery\nThe high quality of the clay combined with the manufacturing process make Polish pottery extremely durable. Fired at over 1200°C, it is classed as stoneware and safe to use in dishwashers, microwaves and fridges. This makes Polish pottery suitable for everyday use at home and in catering. All dishes with a grooved bottom are also safe to use in traditional gas or electric ovens up to 280°C, as well as on glass, ceramic and electric hobs.\n\nCommon Characteristics Of Antique Art\nSigned Limited Edition print\nPublished April 2005\nImage Size:- 6\" x 6\"\nby David Tatham\nArt is highly a subject of opinion and the question of identifying antique art is ambiguous in essence. Some people believe that only those artifacts from the Roman and Greek empires are antique. Others consider artifacts\nthat are more than 100 years to be antique. Whichever way one chooses to look at this, there are basic features that will\nalways be prevalent in an antique artifact. The back stamp must be there. It is basically the symbol of the manufacturer stamped or written on the back side of an item\ndetailing important information about it. This will establish the origin of the artifact, the age and for the classical\napproach will determine whether it is from Greek or Roman Empires. The stamp is paramount in ascertaining the authenticity\nand assessing its market value. The maker of the item will also be known. Art lovers are opinionated and could have some bias\ntowards particular artists or manufacturers. Most antique artifacts are handmade and have flaws. Such imperfections are not easy to notice and an individual must carefully\ncheck in order to notice them. Flaws prove that an item was handmade and is likely to be unique and rare. Signs of wear and tear are also common. Most highly valued antiques are of age and are characterized by abrasion, oxidation,\nand shrinkage. In furniture, the presence of crystallized glue and tool marks could also aid in determining the age. The materials used to make the item also matter. For instance in furniture, the presence of the square-headed handmade nails\nrather than the popular round-headed nails could indicate the time of manufacture. The genre must be conspicuous. An individual should be able to determine the age of an artifact easily from its features. The features that determine genre include the materials used, the period, and the artistic style used. Genres that are used\nto classify paintings include Arts and Crafts, Modernist, Art Deco and Art Noumea whereas furniture genres based on historic\nperiods include; Queen Anne, Victorian, Federal American, and Georgian. It is important for one to research the various historic\nperiods before identifying an artifact. The style will be an age indicator. Authenticity is a key feature of any antique item. It is crucial that a painting and prints\nfor example, is original and not a counterfeit of the real thing. Authenticity is established from the manufacturer's stamp on the back side or underside of the item. Determining the authenticity\nrequires an educated approach. It often requires the skills of a professional on this area to ascertain it. It involves a systematic\ninvestigation and analysis to determine whether an item is genuine. Objects must be referenced in national museum records. National museums have records of highly valued antique items. An individual\nmust therefore refer to records in museums closest to the place of origin of the item before deciding on the integrity of an artifact. The features outlined above encapsulate the general features of antique art. They form an essential basis for identifying artifacts. While some collectors may want to personally establish the integrity of an item they have collected, it often requires the eyes\nof an expert. Biography of wildlife artist, David Shepherd, CBE, FRSA, FRGS, OBE. Known as possibly the world's finest wildlife artist. David Shepherd\nhaving worked for many years as an artist\nacross the world,\nHis role as a conservationist is passionately believed, and\nhe has always felt that he had a obligation to help conserve the world and the animals that we live amongst. During his lifetime, David Shepherd has painted and drawn hundreds, if not thousands of images, and loves to talk to people of the many experiences\nhe has had whilst travelling and painting\nthroughout the world, often talking at charity dinners and other prestigeous social events. His personality is beautifully suited to this cause, as his easy going and straight forward attitude comes across well to express the love\nof art and his feelings for the ever decreasing wildlife in the world. As a young man, luck often deals its hand, and this was no exception, he wasn't particularly keen about other college activities.

While living in Europe for many years, Beach visited Poland in 1993 and became a collector of the brightly colored and patterned pieces. She began sending gifts home to her mother and sister-in-law, and after they fell in love as well, she began to wonder if there might be a market for Polish pottery. When she returned home to Florida in 1999, the Polish Pottery business was born. 100 DIFFERENT PATTERNS AND MORE THAN 200 UNIQUE SHAPES. The warehouse itself is a hidden gem, located in an industrial area along Wickham Road at 3185 New York Avenue #13, in Melbourne. But walking through the doors into the 4,000 square feet of retail space filled with color and pattern is an amazing experience. “I’ve heard it’s an adventure coming into the store. It can be a little overwhelming the first time you come in, with so many choices. I suggest taking a stroll through the entire store to get a better idea of what’s available.”\nBeach is happy to walk customers through the offerings and is a wealth of information about the history, artistry and utilitarianism of Polish pottery. “One great feature of Polish pottery is you can create your own unique collection by mixing and matching patterns, and the more you get, the easier it is to add another.”Each piece is hand painted in Poland, and the high firing temperatures create durable, utilitarian stoneware covered in intricate, beautiful decorations. All Polish pottery is oven, microwave and dishwasher safe, making it perfectly suited for everyday use. “It’s essentially functional art,” Beach said. “Some pieces are labeled UNIKAT, meaning ‘unique’ in Polish. Collectors are sure to find some unique pieces to add to their collection.”But for Beach, the things that make certain pieces special are the holiday and family memories wrapped up in her collection. “I have so many traditional pieces I’ve had in my house forever — casseroles and plates I served Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners on year after year. Those are my favorites because they hold such wonderful memories.”\n\nThe Characteristics of Fine China\nThe artistic qualities of fine china may be the first thing you notice, whether you are examining dinnerware, vases or decorative pieces. The art of making porcelain china began in the country that lent its name to these items well over 1,000 years ago. Fine china -- bone or porcelain -- weighs substantially less than an equivalent stoneware or earthenware piece. While newer china pieces are typically dishwasher safe, for older items, don't put them into the dishwasher if you want them to last. China -- a catchall word used to describe most any ceramic piece, dinnerware or decorative item -- can be categorized into four basic types: bone china, porcelain china, stoneware and earthenware. The first two represent fine china, while the latter two are typically associated with everyday dinnerware, crocks, jugs or decorative pieces. The materials used, the firing processes, the decorative glazes and finishing touches mark the difference between fine china and functional china. Place your hand behind a plate of fine bone china -- the highest quality china made -- and you can see its shadow through it. Light passes through bone china, even more translucent than china made from porcelain clays and materials. Bone china, the English answer to Chinese porcelain, has a glasslike quality to it, is very light and thin, and is kiln-fired at even higher temperatures than porcelain china. Bone china seems to glow with an inner light; though seemingly fragile, it is very strong. With an absorbent rate slightly higher than bone china, porcelain china feels somewhat heavier than bone china. While bone china is traditionally white and may or may not have hand-painted designs, porcelain china dinnerware is available in a wide range of colors, rim treatments -- such as gold or silver -- and designer patterns. Not as translucent as bone china, porcelain china is a vitreous product, somewhat glasslike, that nevertheless retains some of the qualities of bone china. Some porcelain china patterns can run into the thousands of dollars for a complete table setting. Hallmarks and Porcelain Marks\nOn the back of fine china or its bottom, you can usually find specific hallmarks, maker's or artist's marks and pattern numbers. Pattern numbers identify the specific design and patterns created on the fine china, useful when you need to replace table settings lost due to breakage. Some brands of china hold greater value than others, based on when the china was made, the country and name of the manufacturer. Porcelain marks can identify the manufacturer, the country of origin and the age of the china. You can research these marks in books, through antique appraisers or online. As a native Californian, artist, journalist and published author, Laurie Brenner began writing professionally in 1975. She has written for newspapers, magazines, online publications and sites. Brenner graduated from San Diego's Coleman College.\n\nIn our Classic Collection you will find the very roots of Polish pottery, reaching back to the early 1700’s. The designs featured in this collection are simple, minimalistic — and it is exactly that simplicity, that renders them so charming. The pattern designers use mostly stamps to create the classic ornaments. The simplicity which characterizes this collection is expressed not only in the patterns themselves, but also in the color scheme, usually limited to just three hues. The Classic Collection is what laid the foundation for the more intricate patterns being designed today.\n\nMany of the finest potters signed their works - in Japanese characters, naturally - and would be serious collectors should check reference books to familiarize themselves with the signatures of famous names such as Ryuzan, Kinkozan and Yabu Meizan. Look for signatures on the base, usually painted in gold but sometimes impressed, and for decorators marks on the panels. These can greatly increase the value of a piece. Other marks to watch out for are the Satsuma\nmon - a cross within a circle that was the badge of the province's ruling family - and the word 'Satsuma' itself, which may appear in Japanese or English. Because there is so much Satsuma ware available in the West, collectors usually avoid chipped, cracked or otherwise damaged pieces. The only exception is when an otherwise very fine piece of work is slightly damaged, and even here the price can be reduced dramatically.\n\n### Question: What makes a Polish pottery piece a Unikat (Signature) item and how is it different from regular pieces?","passages":[{"passage":"Identifying unmarked pottery can be a chore.

I suggest taking a stroll through the entire store to get a better idea of what’s available.”\nBeach is happy to walk customers through the offerings and is a wealth of information about the history, artistry and utilitarianism of Polish pottery. “One great feature of Polish pottery is you can create your own unique collection by mixing and matching patterns, and the more you get, the easier it is to add another.”Each piece is hand painted in Poland, and the high firing temperatures create durable, utilitarian stoneware covered in intricate, beautiful decorations. All Polish pottery is oven, microwave and dishwasher safe, making it perfectly suited for everyday use. “It’s essentially functional art,” Beach said. “Some pieces are labeled UNIKAT, meaning ‘unique’ in Polish. Collectors are sure to find some unique pieces to add to their collection.”But for Beach, the things that make certain pieces special are the holiday and family memories wrapped up in her collection. “I have so many traditional pieces I’ve had in my house forever — casseroles and plates I served Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners on year after year. Those are my favorites because they hold such wonderful memories.”","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:40d41ec3-03b7-4d41-a676-e75586f937a8>"]},{"passage":"The Characteristics of Fine China\nThe artistic qualities of fine china may be the first thing you notice, whether you are examining dinnerware, vases or decorative pieces. The art of making porcelain china began in the country that lent its name to these items well over 1,000 years ago. Fine china -- bone or porcelain -- weighs substantially less than an equivalent stoneware or earthenware piece. While newer china pieces are typically dishwasher safe, for older items, don't put them into the dishwasher if you want them to last. China -- a catchall word used to describe most any ceramic piece, dinnerware or decorative item -- can be categorized into four basic types: bone china, porcelain china, stoneware and earthenware. The first two represent fine china, while the latter two are typically associated with everyday dinnerware, crocks, jugs or decorative pieces. The materials used, the firing processes, the decorative glazes and finishing touches mark the difference between fine china and functional china. Place your hand behind a plate of fine bone china -- the highest quality china made -- and you can see its shadow through it. Light passes through bone china, even more translucent than china made from porcelain clays and materials. Bone china, the English answer to Chinese porcelain, has a glasslike quality to it, is very light and thin, and is kiln-fired at even higher temperatures than porcelain china. Bone china seems to glow with an inner light; though seemingly fragile, it is very strong. With an absorbent rate slightly higher than bone china, porcelain china feels somewhat heavier than bone china. While bone china is traditionally white and may or may not have hand-painted designs, porcelain china dinnerware is available in a wide range of colors, rim treatments -- such as gold or silver -- and designer patterns. Not as translucent as bone china, porcelain china is a vitreous product, somewhat glasslike, that nevertheless retains some of the qualities of bone china. Some porcelain china patterns can run into the thousands of dollars for a complete table setting. Hallmarks and Porcelain Marks\nOn the back of fine china or its bottom, you can usually find specific hallmarks, maker's or artist's marks and pattern numbers. Pattern numbers identify the specific design and patterns created on the fine china, useful when you need to replace table settings lost due to breakage. Some brands of china hold greater value than others, based on when the china was made, the country and name of the manufacturer. Porcelain marks can identify the manufacturer, the country of origin and the age of the china. You can research these marks in books, through antique appraisers or online.

The designs featured in this collection are simple, minimalistic — and it is exactly that simplicity, that renders them so charming. The pattern designers use mostly stamps to create the classic ornaments. The simplicity which characterizes this collection is expressed not only in the patterns themselves, but also in the color scheme, usually limited to just three hues. The Classic Collection is what laid the foundation for the more intricate patterns being designed today.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:b954cb12-0a32-48d3-9695-da10e27d0cad>"]},{"passage":"Many of the finest potters signed their works - in Japanese characters, naturally - and would be serious collectors should check reference books to familiarize themselves with the signatures of famous names such as Ryuzan, Kinkozan and Yabu Meizan. Look for signatures on the base, usually painted in gold but sometimes impressed, and for decorators marks on the panels. These can greatly increase the value of a piece. Other marks to watch out for are the Satsuma\nmon - a cross within a circle that was the badge of the province's ruling family - and the word 'Satsuma' itself, which may appear in Japanese or English. Because there is so much Satsuma ware available in the West, collectors usually avoid chipped, cracked or otherwise damaged pieces. The only exception is when an otherwise very fine piece of work is slightly damaged, and even here the price can be reduced dramatically.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:5b2efe90-3e04-4aab-b177-00dc03c3a01c>"]}]}

Get a Remote Pilots Certificate from the FAA if you’ll be piloting your drone for commercial purposes, including monetized blogs and vlogs\nBy Paul from Travel is Life\nIf you’ll be posting your drone shots on a video channel or blog that is monetized (whether with ads, affiliate links, digital product sales, etc), you’re technically using your drone for commercial purposes, and you need a Remote Pilots Certificate from the FAA. The test costs $150 and takes a day of studying. I enjoyed the process because I learned information about air space regulations, weather patterns, and safety precautions that I would need to know anyway – even as a hobbyist. The fines are too big to risk not obtaining your certificate, and who knows… being commercially licensed might one day make the difference between you getting permission to fly your drone at a particular location and capture the shots you’re after. Places are getting more strict about drone operations every day, and it’s best to play by the rules when federal airspace is involved. Check to see if there is any sensitive or endangered wildlife in the area that you should avoid\nBy Cristina from Travel For Wildlife\nWhen planning your flight take some time to research the area’s wildlife. Your flight shouldn’t approach resting, nesting, or feeding animals as drones can negatively affect wildlife. For example it can flush nesting birds, can cause resting seals to flee toward the water trampling others during their escape, and can dangerously raise the heart rate and stress level of bears. These are just some of the reasons that drones have been banned from National Parks and National Wildlife Refuges in the US. The ban carries a maximum penalty of a $5,000 fine and six months in jail. Other countries have different rules, and it is always important to check the rules for each country. In South Africa, a visitor was banned for life after other visitors reported him for flying a drone in Kruger National Park. If you visit a national park in South Africa and carry a drone, make sure to disclose it when you enter the park, as park officials will seal it until you leave. This might save you a hefty fee or ban for having an unsealed drone found in your car! Be careful not to disturb any wildlife\nBy Christa Rolls from Expedition Wildlife\nBe cautious and conscientious about flying your drone near wildlife. Drones can be seen as a threat to wildlife, and animals will expend unnecessary resources to either defend their territory or flee somewhere they’ll feel protected from your drone. The best consideration is to pinpoint the wildlife present near your flight zone prior to take off, and as soon as their behavior changes in association with the drone’s presence, discontinue flying. Consider having a spotter, meaning one person watches the wildlife’s demeanor for any behavioral changes or stress, while the other operates the drone. This is not only for the wildlife’s safety, and the ethics consideration of flying drones near wildlife, but also for you and your drone’s well-being. A bird dive-bombing your drone can easily take it down, and likely injure the bird in the process, as well as leave you liable for wildlife harassment charges. Make best use of your incredible footage\nBy Bradley from Dream Big, Travel Far\nWith so much effort spent capturing your drone footage, my top tip would be to ensure you have a plan in place to make best use of it. Simply put you have 2 choices. Either you learn how to edit video footage yourself or you hire someone who knows how to. Making breathtaking travel videos are the ultimate reminder of your time abroad. So failing to make use of it is almost a sin! Personally, we are in the process of following both of these options. We have a friend who is great at video editing, and is currently working through our footage in Sri Lanka to make some tantalizing travel videos. At the same time, we have downloaded Adobe Premiere Elements and are busy learning and practicing our skills. Hopefully these tips have prepared you for your first trip with your drone. Feel free to add any other tips for traveling with a drone in the comments below.\n\nHowever, if you have a special commercial project in mind you can apply for an exemption to the Icelandic Transport Authority. A Few Things to Remember\nMany of Iceland’s protected areas have not been uploaded to drone software, so just because the drone is able to take off does not mean that you should\nAlways observe no-drone signs\nMake sure you have a clear plan and ensure that where you wish to fly is legal, safe and with the necessary permits if necessary. If you are flying just for fun, for example for Instagram, please ensure that you follow all rules concerning flying drones for non-commercial purposes. If possible, always alert a local ranger that you are operating in the area. This is mostly out of courtesy. Please also ensure that you are not disturbing the experience for any other visitors. Be a responsible drone pilot. Respect the rules, the people around you, and the nature you want to capture. And above all else…..have fun!! Pssst!!

More and more couples are hiring aerial drone services for their wedding day. Why wouldn’t they? Using drones to capture once (or twice?) in a lifetime wedding is becoming the techy trend these days, taking wedding video and photography to the next level. We are not talking about those drones used to capture and patrol war zones — but rather the small multi rotor UAV’s controlled by an expert pilot from the ground remotely. Many videographers and photographers are adding aerial video and photography to their services after seeing drones being used in real estate and properties, because unlike the typical and traditional wedding photos and videos that uses tripods, cameras and ground videos, UAV’s and drones provide a unique and complementary perspective. Drones provide some of the most dramatic images of the day.It can capture close-ups, bird’s eye view, still images and flyover video footage in all angles and with different effects. What drones can do for your wedding\n- Capture aerial still shots of your wedding and record the ceremony from different viewpoints and angles. - Create a very unique video with an aerial flyover shots, perfect for outdoor weddings and events held in a beautiful setting. - Drones are perfect for landscapes, resort properties and any outdoor venue to capture more dramatic images and give perspective to the location. Aerial video and photography is unique but it can be more expensive than other photography due to equipment cost and dual operators (a pilot and gimbal operator). Careful planning is important to make sure that the actual shoot will go smoothly and of course, is safe. Drones should be operated and controlled by an expert pilot, have liability insurance, and follow best practices such as not flying over people. It can add some costs, but the result is an amazing and a dramatic interpretation of your special day! Aside from weddings, aerial video and photography can also be great for capturing other special occasions and events such as family reunions, birthday parties, school and corporate events.\n\nFlying a Drone in Iceland\nAs the recent eruption on Fagradalsfjall has proven, drones are capable of capturing absolutely incredible shots. Even before the eruption, Iceland was a feast for drone pilots who would come from all over the world looking for stunning content for their Instagram feed, and they would not leave disappointed. You might be planning to do the same? Honestly, who could blame you? So, you are probably wondering what the rules are regarding safety and where you can fly freely? Well, look no further, here is a useful guide regarding flying a drone in Iceland. Which Areas are Safe for Flying a Drone in Iceland? The great news is that, when it comes to flying a drone in Iceland, you may do so freely in most parts of the country. However, as with everywhere, there are certain rules are regulations concerning safe and legal drone use. So, it is best to be prepared. Here are the main rules to follow\nIf you plan to fly for commercial purposes, then you need to register your drone. If its just for fun, then no need to worry! Your drone must weigh no more than 3kg in urban areas, and no more then 25kg in rural areas. You are permitted to fly your drone no more than 120 meters from the ground.You cannot fly any closed than 2km to the international airport, and no more than 1.5km to any other airport in the country. Please ensure that you fly no closer than 150 meters to public and private buildings in rural areas with express permission from the property owner. Also, please ensure you do not fly any closer than 150 meters to public buildings and 50 km to private buildings in urban areas without permission from the property owner. Never fly over crowds of people\nNever disturb wildlife with your drone. Animals such as birds, horses, seals, reindeer, etc are to be left to behave naturally. Drones can be frightening to them, and can cause panicked and unnatural behaviour. Drone flights in all national parks, protected areas, nature reserves and monuments are not permitted. These areas include Vatnajökull National Park, Þingvellir National Park, Snæfellsjökull National Park, Dyrhólaey, Látrabjarg, Hornstrandir, Geysir, Gullfoss, etc.For commercial drone photography, you can apply for an exemption permit to some of the restrictions mentioned above. Flying a Drone in Iceland’s National Parks\nThe national parks of Iceland are off limits for drone use, except on special circumstances. The same is also true for many protected areas of interest around the country. The reason for this is to protect fragile and sensitive nature, animal life and for the safety and enjoyment of other people. For example, places such as Skógafoss waterfall, Dyrhólaey nature reserve and Látrabjarg have a protected status because of nesting birds. The use of drones can disturb the birds and can lead to eggs or chicks being abandoned. This can then lead to a reduction in numbers. There are also many seal colonies around Iceland, and areas that seals simply like to visit, such as Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon. Drones can drive them away from these areas, and they may never return if they do not feel safe. Skógafoss is a very tempting place to film with your drone, and if you film from the left of the waterfall then this is perfectly fine, but once you encroach on the monument area then drones are not permitted. Can I Get Special Permission for Flying a Drone in Iceland’s National Parks? Yes, you can. Provided your footage is to be used for commercial purposes. You can apply for a special permit, where you can discuss your plans. Upon granting of a permit, you will receive expert guidance on where you can fly, at what time of day, etc. You can apply to for a permit in Vatnajökull National Park, Þingvellir National Park and you can also apply to the Environment Agency of Iceland for permission to fly in Snæfellsjökull National Park and all other protected areas that require a permit. They also have lots of useful information about these areas that you should read before you fly. Can I Fly my Drone in Reykjavík and Other Towns? According to the regulations, flying in the city of Reyjkjavík and other towns is not permitted unless you have special permission. The reason for this is because flying to close to airports, as well as public and private property is not permitted under Icelandic law.\n\nIn the past, provided you weren’t within a few miles of a major airport or military base you could rely on few problems. But recently, no-fly zones have begun to sprout up all over the landscape. More and more urban areas and national parks have begun to enforce these zones (enforced via locational ‘geo-fencing’ software I might add, rather than the more exciting prospects of miniaturized air-aircraft batteries or dogfights with specially trained albatrosses), so it’s important to check before setting out to avoid disappointment. Just because you’ve flown there before doesn’t mean things will still be the same, for example, the city where we are now based has changed its no fly zones at least 3 times in the past year, going from a free for all, to a complete ban, to now restricted flying zones just around the city centre and the university campus. You can usually find updated maps online, or through your drone software. So check carefully, and as close as possible to the time of your visit. Plan your drone locations and shots beforehand\nBy Charmaine from LuvMiHome.com\nMake a list of the drone locations you are interested in beforehand. You can use tools such as Google earth to scout your locations and find interesting angles. This will give you an idea of what your location looks like from the air as well as the ground. You will also need to consider what altitude works best for your location. Don’t be afraid to try different altitudes and angles of your target to get the best possible shot. Lighting is an important factor; you will need to figure out the direction of the light during different times of the day and select the appropriate time. Lastly make sure you fly your drone in good weather; snow, rain and wind can be a menace to your drone. Be wary or avoid flying over crowds\nBy Lexi from A Scenic Find\nI’ve seen a few drop out of the sky (mine included), so I’m always super careful about where I fly them. The best places to fly them are in open fields, beaches or anywhere where crowds are sparse. It’s so easy to think of them as toys, but they can and do malfunction mid flight occasionally. I’ve had one of mine drop out of the sky into a lake due to a technical error, since then I’ve always been super strict about where I fly if there are crowds around. Flying with LiPo batteries and keeping them safe\nBy Manon from Visiting the Dutch Countryside\nIf you’re traveling with your drone you, most likely, need to pack LiPo batteries. You can only take LiPo batteries with you in your hand luggage and airlines won’t allow you to check them. LiPo batteries can combust, so you have to do everything you can prevent this. Cover the battery terminals with gaffer’s tape and place the batteries inside a fireproof, special LiPo battery, bag. Don’t forget to drain the batteries before you’re headed to the airport. You need to check with your airlines how many LiPo batteries you are allowed to take. Keeping drone batteries warm in the winter\nBy Manon from Visiting the Dutch Countryside\nWhen you want to use your drone in cold temperatures, or when you’re traveling through cold temperatures, you need to keep the batteries warm. One way of keeping the batteries warm is keeping them in a warm pocket. The batteries drain quick in cold temperatures. So if you can place them close to your body that would be perfect. You can also put the batteries in a sock, which is a better option if you have the batteries in a case. The absolute best place to warm them is close to your body. For instance, wear a sweater with pockets and put a few batteries inside the pockets. Drone footage storage while traveling\nBy Christa from Expedition Wildlife\nMake sure you have a plan to back up your video footage during your travels. There are multiple ways you can ensure the drone videos you’ve taken don’t get lost or damaged – this can include transferring everything onto an external hard drive or onto a cloud account. Also consider keeping multiple memory cards handy to switch out in the event that you need more storage space or don’t want to have all of your hard work on one card alone. We recommend purchasing a tablet, or other lightweight and easily packable device, and an external hard drive to use as a storage space and transfer mechanism for your footage.\n\nI understand most of us can’t take our drone on a yachting vacation around Tahiti, but recording your summer travels from the air has gotten increasingly more popular.

Recreational use of airspace by model aircraft is covered by FAA Advisory Circular 91-57, which generally limits operations for hobby and recreation to below 400 feet and within sight of the operator, and requires permission within five miles of airports and air traffic, according the FAA website. “The law is clear that the FAA may take enforcement action against model aircraft operators who operate their aircraft in a manner that endangers the safety of the national airspace system,” the FAA website states. Derek Inoshita, a spokesman for the Hawaii Department of Transportation, said there have been no reports or complaints about drones near Lihue Airport. The FAA also bans the use of unmanned and remote controlled aircraft near stadiums. The agency has granted only a handful of companies exemptions to use drones commercially. Alao doesn’t have a problem with drones in general. In fact, he said he “wouldn’t mind having one” himself. However, he does have concerns about people flying over his house at night, and thinks it would be appropriate to have their use be restricted to certain hours of the day and public areas, such as parks and beaches. Gray agreed that in light of how loud they are, a curfew makes sense. “My drone sounds like a hive of bees coming at you,” he said. The FAA sets all rules and regulations for unmanned aircraft, which can be found at www.faa.gov\/uas\/. The agency is currently drafting new regulations and expects to finalize them by September 2015.

The best consideration is to pinpoint the wildlife present near your flight zone prior to take off, and as soon as their behavior changes in association with the drone’s presence, discontinue flying. Consider having a spotter, meaning one person watches the wildlife’s demeanor for any behavioral changes or stress, while the other operates the drone. This is not only for the wildlife’s safety, and the ethics consideration of flying drones near wildlife, but also for you and your drone’s well-being. A bird dive-bombing your drone can easily take it down, and likely injure the bird in the process, as well as leave you liable for wildlife harassment charges. Make best use of your incredible footage\nBy Bradley from Dream Big, Travel Far\nWith so much effort spent capturing your drone footage, my top tip would be to ensure you have a plan in place to make best use of it. Simply put you have 2 choices. Either you learn how to edit video footage yourself or you hire someone who knows how to. Making breathtaking travel videos are the ultimate reminder of your time abroad. So failing to make use of it is almost a sin! Personally, we are in the process of following both of these options. We have a friend who is great at video editing, and is currently working through our footage in Sri Lanka to make some tantalizing travel videos. At the same time, we have downloaded Adobe Premiere Elements and are busy learning and practicing our skills. Hopefully these tips have prepared you for your first trip with your drone.

More and more couples are hiring aerial drone services for their wedding day. Why wouldn’t they? Using drones to capture once (or twice?) in a lifetime wedding is becoming the techy trend these days, taking wedding video and photography to the next level. We are not talking about those drones used to capture and patrol war zones — but rather the small multi rotor UAV’s controlled by an expert pilot from the ground remotely. Many videographers and photographers are adding aerial video and photography to their services after seeing drones being used in real estate and properties, because unlike the typical and traditional wedding photos and videos that uses tripods, cameras and ground videos, UAV’s and drones provide a unique and complementary perspective. Drones provide some of the most dramatic images of the day.It can capture close-ups, bird’s eye view, still images and flyover video footage in all angles and with different effects. What drones can do for your wedding\n- Capture aerial still shots of your wedding and record the ceremony from different viewpoints and angles. - Create a very unique video with an aerial flyover shots, perfect for outdoor weddings and events held in a beautiful setting. - Drones are perfect for landscapes, resort properties and any outdoor venue to capture more dramatic images and give perspective to the location. Aerial video and photography is unique but it can be more expensive than other photography due to equipment cost and dual operators (a pilot and gimbal operator). Careful planning is important to make sure that the actual shoot will go smoothly and of course, is safe. Drones should be operated and controlled by an expert pilot, have liability insurance, and follow best practices such as not flying over people. It can add some costs, but the result is an amazing and a dramatic interpretation of your special day! Aside from weddings, aerial video and photography can also be great for capturing other special occasions and events such as family reunions, birthday parties, school and corporate events.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:af09b4e3-a2b8-4b10-a3fc-9b887717e716>"]},{"passage":"Flying a Drone in Iceland\nAs the recent eruption on Fagradalsfjall has proven, drones are capable of capturing absolutely incredible shots. Even before the eruption, Iceland was a feast for drone pilots who would come from all over the world looking for stunning content for their Instagram feed, and they would not leave disappointed. You might be planning to do the same? Honestly, who could blame you? So, you are probably wondering what the rules are regarding safety and where you can fly freely? Well, look no further, here is a useful guide regarding flying a drone in Iceland. Which Areas are Safe for Flying a Drone in Iceland? The great news is that, when it comes to flying a drone in Iceland, you may do so freely in most parts of the country. However, as with everywhere, there are certain rules are regulations concerning safe and legal drone use. So, it is best to be prepared. Here are the main rules to follow\nIf you plan to fly for commercial purposes, then you need to register your drone. If its just for fun, then no need to worry! Your drone must weigh no more than 3kg in urban areas, and no more then 25kg in rural areas. You are permitted to fly your drone no more than 120 meters from the ground.You cannot fly any closed than 2km to the international airport, and no more than 1.5km to any other airport in the country. Please ensure that you fly no closer than 150 meters to public and private buildings in rural areas with express permission from the property owner. Also, please ensure you do not fly any closer than 150 meters to public buildings and 50 km to private buildings in urban areas without permission from the property owner. Never fly over crowds of people\nNever disturb wildlife with your drone. Animals such as birds, horses, seals, reindeer, etc are to be left to behave naturally. Drones can be frightening to them, and can cause panicked and unnatural behaviour. Drone flights in all national parks, protected areas, nature reserves and monuments are not permitted. These areas include Vatnajökull National Park, Þingvellir National Park, Snæfellsjökull National Park, Dyrhólaey, Látrabjarg, Hornstrandir, Geysir, Gullfoss, etc.For commercial drone photography, you can apply for an exemption permit to some of the restrictions mentioned above. Flying a Drone in Iceland’s National Parks\nThe national parks of Iceland are off limits for drone use, except on special circumstances. The same is also true for many protected areas of interest around the country. The reason for this is to protect fragile and sensitive nature, animal life and for the safety and enjoyment of other people. For example, places such as Skógafoss waterfall, Dyrhólaey nature reserve and Látrabjarg have a protected status because of nesting birds. The use of drones can disturb the birds and can lead to eggs or chicks being abandoned. This can then lead to a reduction in numbers. There are also many seal colonies around Iceland, and areas that seals simply like to visit, such as Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon. Drones can drive them away from these areas, and they may never return if they do not feel safe. Skógafoss is a very tempting place to film with your drone, and if you film from the left of the waterfall then this is perfectly fine, but once you encroach on the monument area then drones are not permitted. Can I Get Special Permission for Flying a Drone in Iceland’s National Parks? Yes, you can. Provided your footage is to be used for commercial purposes. You can apply for a special permit, where you can discuss your plans. Upon granting of a permit, you will receive expert guidance on where you can fly, at what time of day, etc. You can apply to for a permit in Vatnajökull National Park, Þingvellir National Park and you can also apply to the Environment Agency of Iceland for permission to fly in Snæfellsjökull National Park and all other protected areas that require a permit. They also have lots of useful information about these areas that you should read before you fly. Can I Fly my Drone in Reykjavík and Other Towns? According to the regulations, flying in the city of Reyjkjavík and other towns is not permitted unless you have special permission. The reason for this is because flying to close to airports, as well as public and private property is not permitted under Icelandic law.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:b6a729be-5161-476d-b9a5-cfe13005cd2f>"]},{"passage":"In the past, provided you weren’t within a few miles of a major airport or military base you could rely on few problems. But recently, no-fly zones have begun to sprout up all over the landscape. More and more urban areas and national parks have begun to enforce these zones (enforced via locational ‘geo-fencing’ software I might add, rather than the more exciting prospects of miniaturized air-aircraft batteries or dogfights with specially trained albatrosses), so it’s important to check before setting out to avoid disappointment. Just because you’ve flown there before doesn’t mean things will still be the same, for example, the city where we are now based has changed its no fly zones at least 3 times in the past year, going from a free for all, to a complete ban, to now restricted flying zones just around the city centre and the university campus. You can usually find updated maps online, or through your drone software. So check carefully, and as close as possible to the time of your visit. Plan your drone locations and shots beforehand\nBy Charmaine from LuvMiHome.com\nMake a list of the drone locations you are interested in beforehand. You can use tools such as Google earth to scout your locations and find interesting angles. This will give you an idea of what your location looks like from the air as well as the ground. You will also need to consider what altitude works best for your location. Don’t be afraid to try different altitudes and angles of your target to get the best possible shot. Lighting is an important factor; you will need to figure out the direction of the light during different times of the day and select the appropriate time. Lastly make sure you fly your drone in good weather; snow, rain and wind can be a menace to your drone. Be wary or avoid flying over crowds\nBy Lexi from A Scenic Find\nI’ve seen a few drop out of the sky (mine included), so I’m always super careful about where I fly them. The best places to fly them are in open fields, beaches or anywhere where crowds are sparse. It’s so easy to think of them as toys, but they can and do malfunction mid flight occasionally. I’ve had one of mine drop out of the sky into a lake due to a technical error, since then I’ve always been super strict about where I fly if there are crowds around. Flying with LiPo batteries and keeping them safe\nBy Manon from Visiting the Dutch Countryside\nIf you’re traveling with your drone you, most likely, need to pack LiPo batteries. You can only take LiPo batteries with you in your hand luggage and airlines won’t allow you to check them. LiPo batteries can combust, so you have to do everything you can prevent this. Cover the battery terminals with gaffer’s tape and place the batteries inside a fireproof, special LiPo battery, bag. Don’t forget to drain the batteries before you’re headed to the airport. You need to check with your airlines how many LiPo batteries you are allowed to take. Keeping drone batteries warm in the winter\nBy Manon from Visiting the Dutch Countryside\nWhen you want to use your drone in cold temperatures, or when you’re traveling through cold temperatures, you need to keep the batteries warm. One way of keeping the batteries warm is keeping them in a warm pocket. The batteries drain quick in cold temperatures. So if you can place them close to your body that would be perfect. You can also put the batteries in a sock, which is a better option if you have the batteries in a case. The absolute best place to warm them is close to your body. For instance, wear a sweater with pockets and put a few batteries inside the pockets. Drone footage storage while traveling\nBy Christa from Expedition Wildlife\nMake sure you have a plan to back up your video footage during your travels. There are multiple ways you can ensure the drone videos you’ve taken don’t get lost or damaged – this can include transferring everything onto an external hard drive or onto a cloud account. Also consider keeping multiple memory cards handy to switch out in the event that you need more storage space or don’t want to have all of your hard work on one card alone. We recommend purchasing a tablet, or other lightweight and easily packable device, and an external hard drive to use as a storage space and transfer mechanism for your footage.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:00a6ffbf-5816-4801-91a8-1bcc056ffc6b>"]},{"passage":"I understand most of us can’t take our drone on a yachting vacation around Tahiti, but recording your summer travels from the air has gotten increasingly more popular.

Recreational use of airspace by model aircraft is covered by FAA Advisory Circular 91-57, which generally limits operations for hobby and recreation to below 400 feet and within sight of the operator, and requires permission within five miles of airports and air traffic, according the FAA website. “The law is clear that the FAA may take enforcement action against model aircraft operators who operate their aircraft in a manner that endangers the safety of the national airspace system,” the FAA website states. Derek Inoshita, a spokesman for the Hawaii Department of Transportation, said there have been no reports or complaints about drones near Lihue Airport. The FAA also bans the use of unmanned and remote controlled aircraft near stadiums. The agency has granted only a handful of companies exemptions to use drones commercially. Alao doesn’t have a problem with drones in general. In fact, he said he “wouldn’t mind having one” himself. However, he does have concerns about people flying over his house at night, and thinks it would be appropriate to have their use be restricted to certain hours of the day and public areas, such as parks and beaches. Gray agreed that in light of how loud they are, a curfew makes sense. “My drone sounds like a hive of bees coming at you,” he said.

For businesses dealing with uncertain demand and lead times, there are specific models available. The newsvendor problem approach is particularly useful when dealing with perishable items or services with time-sensitive demand.","answer":"Managing inventory for a service business can be different from a traditional product-based business, but it's still crucial for ensuring smooth operations and customer satisfaction. Here are some strategies to effectively manage inventory in a service business:\n\n1. **Track Service Capacity**: Instead of tracking physical goods, a service business needs to manage its service capacity. This involves scheduling, resource allocation, and understanding lead times for services. Use tools like calendar systems or scheduling software to manage appointments and ensure that you don't overbook.\n\n2. **Maintain Equipment and Supplies**: Service businesses often rely on equipment and supplies for their operations. Ensure that you have a maintenance schedule for equipment and a system to track when supplies need to be restocked. This might involve using inventory management software to monitor usage and automatically reorder when levels get low.\n\n3. **Implement a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) Approach**: For perishable supplies or equipment that wears out, apply a FIFO approach to ensure that the oldest resources are used first. This prevents waste and ensures that your business is operating with the most current and effective tools.\n\n4. **Regular Audits and Reviews**: Conduct regular reviews of your service capacity and inventory levels. This helps identify inefficiencies, such as underutilized resources or excessive lead times, which can then be addressed to improve service delivery.\n\n5. **Leverage Technology**: Use inventory management and scheduling software that can integrate with your business operations. This can help automate tracking, scheduling, and reordering processes, reducing the risk of human error.\n\n6. **Set Clear Par Levels and Reorder Points**: Determine the minimum levels (par levels) for your supplies and equipment, and set reorder points to ensure you always have what you need without overstocking.\n\n7. **Optimize Resource Allocation**: Analyze your service offerings to understand which services are most profitable and in highest demand. Allocate resources accordingly to maximize efficiency and profitability.\n\n8. **Monitor Customer Demand**: Use data analytics to understand customer demand patterns. This can help you predict future needs and adjust your service capacity and inventory levels accordingly.\n\n9. **Build Relationships with Suppliers**: Establish strong relationships with suppliers to ensure you can get the necessary supplies and equipment when needed. This might involve negotiating terms, such as bulk discounts or priority access.\n\n10. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly review your inventory and service management processes to identify areas for improvement. Implement best practices and adapt your strategies as needed to stay competitive and efficient.\n\nBy focusing on these strategies, a service business can effectively manage its inventory, ensuring that it has the necessary resources to deliver quality services while minimizing costs and maximizing efficiency.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: Do not be scared to request a lower minimum order quantity to avoid carrying as much inventory. A healthy connection is about more than being pleasant. It all comes down to practical, proactive communication. Notify your supplier when you anticipate a spike in sales or a high volume of purchase orders so they can adapt production accordingly. Request that they warn you when a product is running late so that you can suspend promotions or find a temporary replacement. 5. Physical inventory\nA physical inventory, also known as a stock take, is the process of counting all of your goods simultaneously. After the fiscal year, many businesses do this to coincide with accounting and income tax reporting. Although physical inventories usually are performed once a year, they may be pretty disruptive to corporate operations, and they are tedious. If you do discover a disparity, it can be challenging to narrow down the source of the error when looking back over a whole year. How To Develop an Inventory Action Plan\nBecause inventory storage is costly, businesses are frequently irritated when products collect dust on shelves rather than customers’ purchasing and generating income. While dusting the shelves adds extra effort, it’s not nearly as awful as dealing with a disgruntled customer because you’ve run out of his favorite product. Inventory stock plans are intended to avert one of these outcomes. Step 1: Ascertain Demand\nAn intelligent inventory plan’s first rule is to stock things that customers desire and that statistics indicate are likely to be purchased. This can be determined using historical sales data, which can be obtained by tracking sales over time and logging the results in a database. Sell an average of 30 cartons of milk per day, with steady demand throughout the week. Your inventory control strategy should allow you to meet that demand while also avoiding excessive inventory. Under certain conditions, you may also wish to keep select items in stock, even if an order is weaker or less predictable. For instance, if a critical spare part for an appliance you sell is challenging to obtain promptly, stocking a limited supply can be a prudent business option. Suppose ordering that position at the last minute is prohibitively expensive, and its absence causes customers to switch providers. In that case, the storage costs may be negligible about the costs of not having it when needed. Step 2: Create a Plan for Replenishment\nSupply chain management is essential to the success of any inventory management strategy. Determine your reorder points, the time required for inventory to arrive, and any potential impediments. For example, a just-in-time inventory system works best when you are confident that you can obtain required goods promptly if necessary. Establish a broad replacement schedule for things you will require frequently. This could include daily deliveries of perishables to monthly shipments of non-perishables. Additionally, consider when you need stock replenishment on an Irregular Schedule and the associated costs. Step 3: Maintain Inventory Control\nThe tracking methods of an inventory system are only as good as the system itself. Ideally, use a point-of-sale software system to catalog your inventory and track changes in real-time, and train your personnel to use it at all times. This can be difficult in a Small Firm that prepares completed items using materials from a central inventory base, such as a restaurant, but it is still necessary. Each time a customer puts an order, keep track of which ingredients go into a meal or what goes into a complete cabinet and drain those items from your inventory. Step 4: Monitor and Adjust\nPeriodically re-examine your inventory control system to ensure that the basic assumptions remain valid. If you find that you are suddenly out of corn chips with each inventory cycle – yet have more salsa than you require – your initial demand projections may have been incorrect. Changing the order quantity for each item might help return your inventory levels to their optimal state. Developing a liquidation strategy for unsold inventory can help you move it out of storage and maximize the use of available space. For instance, end-of-season discount sales might help clear out inventory in a retail business that would otherwise linger in stock for an extended time. How do you keep track of your inventory? The easiest inventory tracking method is to manually count your stock every two weeks and compare it to sales. This is referred to as periodic inventory. Additionally, perpetual inventory utilizes an inventory management app or software incorporated with your business’s point of sale system.\n\nInventory shrink in the United States cost the retail industry about $46.8 billion. A business must have an efficient system of inventory management. The process involves tracking the stock and inventory life cycle once it gets to your business. If you aren’t aware of your inventory, decision making becomes problematic. Whether you are a brick-and-mortar or an online retailer, inventory management is imperative. With the different techniques available, you can’t miss a solution that will work for your business. What are the secrets small businesses can use to save money on inventory management? Learn how to manage inventories more effectively now. One principle of inventory management you ought to consider is the first-in, first-out approach. This inventory method ensures you sell your old stock first. It is especially vital when selling perishable products that might end up as spoilage. The first in, first out approach, commonly referred to as FIFO, also applies to non-perishables. Items can be worn out over time, that’s why storing them for long isn’t advisable. What’s more, the packaging designs keep changing. You need to restructure your warehouse in a way that encourages FIFO. Have a back door to ensure that the new products are at the backside. When the old products are at the front, the chances are that they will sell before the new entrants. 2. Use a Real-time and Centralized Database\nThe days of pen and paper in-store inventory control are over. Companies are adopting efficient options such as Excel to manage inventory. Nonetheless, the use of paper is still evident though minimal. With today’s dynamic business environment, inventory management should be within a centralized database. A supply chain has multiple users. A centralized system will allow all users to access the database in real-time. An inventory tracking system allows you to check products from the point the supplier delivers up until it reaches the customer. You need to note down the description and value of each item. Analyze the time the supplier takes to deliver. You can see the stock at this stage and plan. The timely interventions will save you money and waste. Besides, you’ll know if it’s necessary to make any adjustments at each point of the supply chain. Recent research projects that automation will reduce the need for office support by 20%. Industries are adopting automation because of increased efficiency. If you’ve been wondering how to manage inventories, automation can be an ideal option. Inputting data manually can be time-consuming and full of errors. The process is repetitive and can be quite daunting for your employees. Save your workers the overwhelming tasks and automate some processes. Automating most of your inventory management processes can increase scale-able. If you have to email and call your suppliers and workers each day to know the amount of inventory, it means that your business isn’t scale-able. Automated systems allow you to gather information faster. Automation decreases human error that’s imminent when making manual entries. Consequently, you might undersell or oversell your items. Automation allows you to edit or upgrade inventory at any time. With automated inventory processes, you don’t need to spend hours analyzing data at the expense of other business operations. Adopt systems that will help in maximizing time. An extra hour in your business is a resource worth pursuing. 4. Stock Auditing\nThe stock audit is the physical verification of the inventory assets of a company. Auditing your inventory is not an exciting process. Yet, it is crucial for effective inventory management. Moving thousands of items increases the risk of unnoticed loses or damages. Failure to track your stock can lead to business disappointments. Imagine taking and processing a customer order only to realize the item is not in stock? You might lose customer credibility just because of not auditing your stock. Regular stock auditing notifies you on items that are out of stock. Have an up-to-date warehouse to avoid losing sales. Entrepreneurs such as restaurant owners need to make regular audits to maintain customer satisfaction. You can get restaurant inventory management software to control inventory and optimize the ordering process. Stock auditing is necessary for any industry. It will allow you to identify discrepancies and curtail cases of theft and employee malpractices. You can shop for software that can help in regular auditing to have an update on the available stock. 5.\n\nInventory management is an essential part of doing business, whether you’re a Fortune 500 company or a mom-and-pop shop. It will come as no surprise, however, that the majority of small and medium-sized businesses don’t operate best practices when it comes to their inventory. To say that current practices are on the sloppy side would be polite. Many businesses fall into the trap of overstocking items, just in case there is a sudden glut of demand on the market. The problem with this is that it worsens the condition of the balance sheet while at the same time, forcing you to increase the space that you dedicate to storing stock. Overall, it pushes up your costs and makes your firm less competitive. In this article, we’re going to investigate how you can get inventive with inventory. So, let’s take a look. Get A Third Party To Track Stock\nIf you run a small business, then the chances are that you don’t have the time or resources to develop your own stock tracking system, allowing you to see what you’ve got in stock and what’s on order at any given moment. The good news, however, is that you don’t need to do any of this yourself: it can all be overseen by a third party. Take dental practices, for instance. Many track dental purchases using a third-party system rather than attempting to do it themselves. Not only does this help bring down costs, but it also improves the patient experience. Customers no longer have to worry about not getting the items that they need. It’s all automated, reducing the chance of error. Be Consistent With How You Manage Incoming Inventory\nLarge businesses make sure that the way that they manage incoming inventory is the same every time to avoid things like shrinkage and double counting. But small companies don’t operate at the same level of rigor. Often each individual in the firm has their own way of receiving new inventory, creating tracking issues. It’s a good idea, therefore, to develop a standard system with your staff so that each person in your organization knows how they should receive stock in the future. Doing this will help you verify that you’ve received the right items, saving you money in the long-term. Update Inventory Totals Daily\nIt might seem basic, but many small businesses don’t update their inventories at the end of the working day. This is a problem. If you don’t track sales, then you won’t know what’s sold and what needs to be ordered in larger quantities. Tracking sales allows you to see seasonal variations in demand, as well as day-to-day demand fluctuations which could help you better manage stock overall. Conduct An Inventory Audit\nDo you know what’s in your inventory? Or have you just been guessing for the last few months since you last took stock? Many successful businesses audit their inventory on a daily or weekly basis. Not only does this allow you to match up the real levels of your stock to what you think you have, but it also shows you which products are your most popular.\n\nA marketing communication plan is an essential tool for any firm. Generally speaking, if you want your firm to succeed, you must implement an integrated marketing communication plan. Communicating…continue reading\n5+ Sample Inventory Action Plan\nWhat Is an Inventory Planning? Inventory planning enables businesses to purchase the appropriate amount of goods and determine how frequently to replenish. Inventory planning assists in lowering the cost of stocking things and ensuring that there is sufficient stock for manufacturing and selling items. Inventory management is a significant component of supply chain management. According to research, the 80\/20 rule implies that 80% of outcomes originate from 20% of efforts, customers, or another unit of measurement. When applied to inventories, the rule means that businesses generate approximately 80% of their revenues from 20% of their products. Benefits of Inventory Planning\nInventory control and planning are two processes part of inventory management. Planning and controlling are critical to management success, as with every management process. The rationale for such a strong emphasis on inventory is that it typically represents a corporation’s most significant cash-flow component. This is true for both purchasing and selling merchandise. As a result, inventory management directly impacts the organization’s financial health. Inventory control and planning benefit small firms in the following ways:\nInventory Management Strategies\nInventory management is a highly adaptable aspect of the company. Each business has a unique inventory control strategy. However, every organization should seek to eliminate human error as much as possible from inventory management, which includes utilizing inventory management software. Regardless of the method you employ, the following will help you manage your inventory more effectively—and increase your cash flow. 1. Six Sigma\nSix Sigma is a methodology and toolkit for enhancing business processes. It is used in inventory and supply chain management to minimize excess and obsolete write-offs. This inventory is frequently sold below cost or donated, which results in a loss of revenue for small business owners. Having the appropriate stock to meet demand minimizes waste and variation issues. Six Sigma is an excellent way of resolving inventory issues. It is orderly and dependable. 2. Set par levels\nSet par levels for each of your goods to simplify inventory management. Par levels are the bare minimum amount of product that must always be on hand. When your inventory falls below certain specified levels, it’s time to place more orders. Ideally, you’ll order the smallest quantity necessary to return above par. Par levels vary by product and determine the speed of an item sells and the time required to restock. While establishing par levels needs some study and decision-making upfront, they will streamline the ordering process. Not only will this make decision-making more accessible for you, but it will also empower your team to make decisions on your behalf. Bear in mind that circumstances change over time. Verify par levels many times a year to ensure they remain reasonable. Meanwhile, don’t be scared to tweak your par levels upward or below. First-in, first-out (FIFO) is a critical inventory management philosophy. This means that your oldest stock is sold first (first in), not your newest store. This is critical for perishable products to avoid unsellable spoiling. Additionally, FIFO is an intelligent technique for non-perishable products. If the same boxes are constantly relegated to the back, they are more prone to wear out. Also, packaging design and functionalities frequently evolve. You don’t want to ramble up with something any longer marketable. To handle a FIFO system effectively, you’ll need a well-organized warehouse. This often entails adding fresh items from the back or otherwise ensuring that existing inventory remains initially. If you’re operating with a warehousing and fulfillment provider, they’re likely already doing this, but it’s prudent to confirm. 4. Relationship management\nSuccessful inventory management requires the ability to adapt fast. Whether you need to return a slow-selling item to make place for a new product, swiftly replenish a high-volume seller, solve manufacturing concerns, or temporarily extend your storage space, it’s critical to maintain a solid relationship with your suppliers. In this manner, they’ll be more receptive to collaborating with you to resolve issues. Maintaining a positive relationship with your product suppliers, in particular, is critical. Frequently, minimum order amounts are negotiable.\n\nEffective Forecasting\nForecasting is central to inventory management. You need to predict the availability of supplies and your customer’s demands. Your inventory management needs to integrate with your business. Understand the seasons and the impact they have on your business. Will the Christmas and New Year holidays affect your product’s demand? Focus on products that are fast-moving during specific events. Research if there are any upcoming marketing events or fairs in your region. You are likely to sell more items than usual. For this reason, you might need to have a higher stock of specific products based on the type of event. To learn how to manage inventories effectively, you need precise predictions. Take advantage of the influx of customers during high peak seasons. Your business will benefit from the approach. 6. Note the Minimum Stock Level\nYou need to know the minimum stock level for timely reorders. Allowing your stock levels to go low has adverse effects on production. Understand how to go about determining the minimum stock level for smooth inventory. One of the factors to consider is the nature of the material. If you get your materials from one supplier, fixing the stock level might be unnecessary. But if you have several suppliers, you need to maintain the minimum stock level to sustain production. You ought to analyze the lead time. For a shorter lead time, the reorder level should remain constant. The longer lead times affect the supply chain because of the changing variability and demand. 7. The Pareto Principle\nStreamlining your inventory management is not a straightforward process. The scattered and varied nature of inventory makes its organization complex. The 80\/20 rule, also known as the Pareto principle, can enhance the efficiency of inventory control. The 80\/20 rule is an invaluable framework in controlling the flow of your inventory. Simply put, the 80\/20 rule means that 20% of your inventory is responsible for 80% of your profits. Your top sellers are 20%, which keeps you in business even during tough seasons. When you understand the Pareto principle, you’ll know the products that need prioritizing. Give extra attention to your top products. Monitor the stock and have these products in an easily accessible area. You will know how to manage inventories effectively once you understand the significance of the 80\/20 rule. The insights will enable you to make informed decisions on suppliers. Your top-products supplier should be reliable enough. 8. Quality Control\nQuality control is a crucial part of any business. The quality control tools in place can lead to business growth and customer satisfaction. Have a checklist so that your team can assist in confirming the quality of supplies. You can check for any signs of damage such as broken seals, tears, or leaks. Raise the issue with your supplier as you identify the damage. Selling an item that has any signs of tear can damage your credibility as the seller. Confirm the product sizes, styles, and colors. Your order should match your description. Ensure that you also confirm the prices. Maintain high-quality standards to increase your sales and satisfy your customers. Confirm the lighting, temperature, and humidity of your warehouse. Poor storage can undermine the quality of goods, whether perishable or non-perishable. Amazon’s shipping costs for the first quarter of 2019 was $9.6 billion. The expenses involved in storing and shipping products can be high. That’s why dropshipping can be an ideal way of managing your inventory more affordably. Drop-shipping allows you to sell products without necessarily holding them in your warehouse. When a consumer buys an item from your store, the manufacturer or wholesaler can do the inventory and shipping. This approach can be cost-effective because you won’t have to incur expenses on storage and several inventory processes. Dropshipping is one of the inventory methods adopted by online retailers. One inevitable problem with drop shipping is minimal involvement. For that reason, customer satisfaction might be unachievable. If a manufacturer delivers a defective product, your credibility as the seller is at stake. 10. Note the Low Turn Stock\nDo you have a product that has been lying in your warehouse for more than six months? It’s time to reconsider whether it is worth stocking the item. The more such things stay on the shelf, the more their value reduces. The excess stock is a wastage of your precious store. Consider having a promotional sale to get rid of such items. You can sell them at a 50% discount to attract more customers.\n\nAre you looking for an effective way to manage and track inventory in your business?

This article will provide an overview of the different types of services available and discuss the benefits they can offer. What is Inventory Management and Tracking?Inventory management and tracking is a process of managing and tracking inventory items, such as raw materials, parts, and finished products. It is typically done using a software system that tracks the quantity, location, and status of the items in the inventory. This system also helps with the ordering, storage, and delivery of items. The goal of inventory management and tracking is to ensure that a business has enough inventory to meet customer demand while minimizing costs. Benefits of Inventory Management and Tracking ServicesInventory management and tracking services provide businesses with a number of benefits, including improved accuracy and efficiency in managing inventory, better customer service, reduced costs, and improved product availability. By using an inventory management system, businesses can track the flow of goods through their warehouses or stores, allowing them to better manage their stock levels. This helps to reduce costs by preventing over-ordering or under-ordering of goods. Additionally, it allows businesses to quickly identify and respond to customer orders or stock shortages. Common Solutions for Inventory Management and Tracking ServicesThere are several common solutions for inventory management and tracking services. These include barcoding systems, RFID technology, and software-based inventory systems. Barcoding systems are used to track inventory items by scanning barcodes on the items. RFID technology uses radio frequencies to track the location and status of items. Software-based systems provide an automated way to manage inventory by tracking item information, such as quantity, location, and status. Best Practices for Implementing Inventory Management and Tracking ServicesWhen implementing an inventory management system, there are several best practices that should be followed. First, businesses should define the scope of their inventory management system by determining what needs to be tracked. This includes identifying the types of items that need to be tracked, as well as any other information that needs to be recorded such as expiration dates and minimum quantities. Additionally, businesses should choose a system that meets their needs in terms of scalability, ease of use, cost effectiveness, and integration with other systems. Challenges in Inventory Management and Tracking ServicesOne of the main challenges with inventory management and tracking services is maintaining accurate data. If data is inaccurate or incomplete, it can lead to incorrect decisions being made about stock levels or customer orders. To prevent this from happening, businesses should ensure they have processes in place for verifying data accuracy on a regular basis. Additionally, businesses should regularly review their inventory processes to ensure they are efficient and effective.

As your business grows or changes, so do your processes for inventory management. Below we review the basics of inventory management, common challenges companies are facing today, cost reduction strategies, and why and when to consider new inventory management software. What is inventory management? Inventory management is the process of ordering, storing and delivering products in the form of finished goods or raw materials for manufacturers. It’s all about balance – having the right product in the right quantity at the right time in the right place at the right cost. Role within the supply chain\nInventory management is a crucial part of your supply chain. It addresses how you order, maintain and deliver your inventory, and is a key component of efficient distribution operations. Your stock, or lack thereof, can have wide-reaching effects on the rest of the supply chain. Three core parts of inventory management are:\n- Purchasing: Acquiring finished goods awaiting sale or raw materials required to produce your product – the beginning of the inventory management process. - Storage: Housing your inventory before it is sold. Businesses use inventory control practices to manage inventory levels and optimize supply levels. Tools such as regular inventory counts, optimizing shipping locations and automation are ways to improve your inventory storage efforts. - Delivery: The last stage of inventory management – shipping your product to the customer. Logistics play a key role here, because evidence shows that one of the quickest ways to lose customers is through unreliable or late deliveries. Overall, inventory planning helps you avoid three major problems: stockouts, overstocking and inefficient processes. Doing regular stock counts and leveraging technology are key to efficient inventory planning. Other processes – determining your organization’s economic order quantity (or EOQ), demand forecasting, consistent employee training, quality control and more – are additional ways to prevent inventory issues. Common inventory challenges today\nThere are dozens of factors that affect your ability to manage your inventory. Common inventory management problems include:\n- Low cash flow: Holding too much inventory ties up cash that could be used in other areas of the business. - Need to bring inventory in-house: Using a third-party for your supply chain operations makes sense for some businesses. However, operational changes or business growth sometimes require you to reduce or eliminate outsourcing. Adopting best practices for inventory management will allow you to oversee your supply chain efficiently. - Stockouts or overstocking: If you have low visibility or inefficient inventory control practices, poor demand forecasting can lead to too much or too little stock on your shelves. This can lead to lost revenue. - Adding new products: Adding new products to your warehouse shelves without a system in place to locate and organize your stock can result in confusion and disorganization. Using a warehouse inventory management system, including barcoding and scanning, reduces error and increases efficiency. - Little to no reporting: If you aren’t tracking your sales and operations, you’re missing out on critical data. Good inventory planning relies on up-to-date information in order to make accurate forecasting decisions. Cost reduction strategies in inventory management\nFrom capital spent on purchasing to overhead for warehouse storage and shipping costs to deliver goods to customers, there are a lot of opportunities to reduce costs when it comes to inventory management. Dependable cost reduction strategies in inventory management include:\n- Quality control: Not only do you want to offer customers the best product, but you also want their quality to be consistent. Quality control practices help you monitor batches of inventory, make better sales order decisions, meet regulatory requirements and more, which in turn can lessen business costs. - Shipping location optimization: You can use third-party distribution as a means to fill orders, such as distribution centers, in order to hold inventory closer to the customer can reduce costs in order to earn the lowest cost and fastest delivery. - Regular inventory counts: Maintaining regularity when it comes to counting your inventory through a streamlined process attempts to identify and prevent issues before they occur. You can automate this process within an inventory management system. - Economic order quantity: EOQ is a formula for ordering inventory based on the ideal order quantity.\n\nWhile you will count losses, you will be a lesson wiser on what’s not to stock in the future. Better still, you can seek to understand why a particular product is not moving and make the necessary changes. Learning How to Manage Inventories Effectively Should Be a Priority for Any Businessperson\nYour inventories can break your business if not well-controlled. With proper inventory management, you can have efficient record keeping, reduce stock-outs, and manage processes in multiple locations. Now that you know how to manage inventories, explore our site further for more informative business articles.\n\nSound inventory management techniques are the foundation for strategic procurement, enabling you to:\nChoosing the right inventory management processes that suit your dental practice is not a simple task, and the more your business grows, the more difficult managing your inventory can be. That's why laying the right foundation with a scalable solution is critical for growth. Luckily, Method is here to help. Below we outline what inventory management entails, its benefits, and the techniques and best practices that make for good inventory management. We'll also dig into how digitization can enable efficiency and make life easier for employees, so they can get on with taking care of patients. Inventory management is the tracking and managing of inventory from the purchase of goods through to their sale or usage. Tracking inventory allows you to identify when it's time to order and how much to order, ensuring you always have enough stock of the right supplies to service your patients. Learning to manage your inventory is the first step in gaining control of your spending so you can stay within budget, minimize waste and leverage your purchasing volumes to reduce costs and improve profits. Although your supply inventory is needed to produce revenue, it also ties up cash. Too much inventory impedes your cash flow and puts you at risk of financial hits from expired, lost, or damaged stock. This is why inventory turnover (how long your inventory sits before it is used) is a good measurement of your inventory management. Inventory management is a key component of an organization's financial health, as it ensures you carry the appropriate amount of stock to suit your business needs. Carrying too much stock ties up cash and puts you at risk of loss, damaged or expired inventory. But too little inventory can lead to stockouts, damaging your patient care and revenue. Proper inventory management can also help save you money. By understanding your usage, you can leverage your purchasing volumes for cost savings and take advantage of economies of scale. Inventory management can save you on soft costs (indirect costs such as labor) and make life easier for your employees. By removing the guesswork from buying supplies, streamlining processes, and organizing supplies, employees can more easily reorder supplies and quickly find what they need when they need it. Your dental office is a busy place. But, by taking some moments to review and establish some essential inventory management processes, you can remove some of the chaos while improving profits. It's a win-win for employees and your balance sheet, providing you with a systematic, scalable approach to managing inventory that optimizes profits and supports future growth. For dental practices, the goal of inventory management is to know your stock levels, where that stock is located, and identify when it is time to order more and in what quantities. At its most basic level, the process works by tracking your current stock levels and then adjusting inventory down, as it is used, and up, upon receipt of deliveries. As no system is perfectly executed, inventory counts will lose accuracy over time. Therefore, physical inventory counts are performed to audit, validate and adjust inventory levels as needed to increase accuracy. The process begins when you identify the requirement for a specific supply. The item is then sourced, a vendor selected, and an order placed and tracked. Upon delivery and verification of the received item, quantity, and condition (the product must be in good order and fit for use), the quantity received is then adjusted into inventory. The inventory management process also involves organizing storage and analyzing future requirements by taking into consideration factors that may impact usages such as growth, scheduled services, or holidays to ensure inventory levels suffice and are used as efficiently as possible. Below we've listed nine good-to-know inventory management terms and techniques most relevant to the dental industry. These are the methods and processes that help you to balance your priorities, keeping your practice safe from disruption while taking into consideration the availability of resources and profits.The point is not to implement all these processes at once, but to choose what is most imperative for your practice and make small but ongoing improvements over time — because small changes lead to big impacts. Based on the famous Pareto principle, the ABC analysis is a way of identifying and categorizing inventory by popularity, with A being your highest movers and C being the least.\n\nYour (management) mileage may vary\nWhile these are the basics of inventory management for any company, the exact practices vary widely based on the industry and the product involved. A fast fashion company has to sell all of the season’s inventory within a very limited time or risk having to sell the overstock at a steeply discounted price. On the other hand, an auto parts manufacturer can keep their stock on hand longer as the demand for their product does not diminish so quickly outside of the season during which it was produced. Similarly, a beverage manufacturer has different inventory needs as either of the above examples since their product must be stored at a certain temperature and be sold before the sell by date. On a balance sheet, inventory is a current asset since the company will sell the finished product in the near future, depending on the type of product. However, this does require that companies keep careful counts of their current inventory to ensure that there are no errors in their accounting. Typically, companies use either first-in-first-out (FIFO) costing, last-in-first-out (LIFO) costing, or weighted-average costing to account for their inventory. The 4 types of inventory\nIn accounting, company’s inventory will fall into one of the following four categories:\nRaw materials are what a company uses to produce its goods. A company can either purchase and process the raw materials itself or outsource that work to a manufacturer. As the name implies, works-in-progress are the raw materials in the process of becoming finished products. They include the cost of the raw materials as well as other costs such as packaging, labor, and shipping. This type of inventory is a good that finished with production and is ready to be sold to customers\nMany people confuse merchandise with finished goods as they are both finished products that are available to consumers. However, merchandise differs in that it was purchased as a finished good from a different company than the one that intends to sell it. Inventory management techniques and best practices\nThough inventory management is a highly customizable system of practices, certain measures should be taken to minimize human error and reduce the chances of costly mistakes. Below is a list of procedures that will help any business, regardless of size or industry, to streamline their inventory control and improve efficiency. Set par levels\nPar levels are the minimum quantity of a product that you have in stock. If a product quantity falls below the par level, it’s time to buy more. This measure helps to ensure that a company is never out of stock of any particular item and can meet customer demand in a timely manner. These levels should not be set arbitrarily, however. Forecasting can help you to determine the minimum amount of product that you should have on hand at all times. This number may fluctuate by season so attention should be given to future conditions. Par levels should also be set according to the quantities of raw materials it takes to produce a finished good. These numbers should not get too high above the minimum, though, as doing so can unnecessarily tie up capital that would be better spent elsewhere. Establishing reorder points\nClosely related to par levels, an order point is the time when you replenish your stock, but unlike par levels, reorder points have to take into account shipping times and potential delays. When doing so, it is in good practice to order “safety stock”, a level of extra stock that is maintained to mitigate the risk of disruptions in the supply chain. Determining reorder points manually can be tedious, but inventory management software can automate this process to help make your inventory restocking more efficient. If inventory control is a system of maintaining enough inventory to supply a demand, then it follows that accurate forecasting of future demand is a crucial part of successful inventory management. Forecasting uses historical data of production, sales, and demand planning to infer the necessary inventory level at a certain future time. Countless variables need to be taken into account, including market trends, market growth, seasonality, consumer surveys, and more. Though the process can be time consuming, an accurate estimate of future inventory needs can help avoid the problems associated with overstock and out-of-stock and can help ensure timely fulfillment. Use ABC analysis\nABC analysis, or activity-based costing, is a practice that helps to determine the value of your stock based on what percentage of your revenue it generates. This helps a business to prioritize certain types of stock based on how profitable it is.\n\n### Question: What's the best way to manage inventory for a service business?","passages":[{"passage":"Do not be scared to request a lower minimum order quantity to avoid carrying as much inventory. A healthy connection is about more than being pleasant. It all comes down to practical, proactive communication. Notify your supplier when you anticipate a spike in sales or a high volume of purchase orders so they can adapt production accordingly. Request that they warn you when a product is running late so that you can suspend promotions or find a temporary replacement. 5. Physical inventory\nA physical inventory, also known as a stock take, is the process of counting all of your goods simultaneously. After the fiscal year, many businesses do this to coincide with accounting and income tax reporting. Although physical inventories usually are performed once a year, they may be pretty disruptive to corporate operations, and they are tedious. If you do discover a disparity, it can be challenging to narrow down the source of the error when looking back over a whole year. How To Develop an Inventory Action Plan\nBecause inventory storage is costly, businesses are frequently irritated when products collect dust on shelves rather than customers’ purchasing and generating income. While dusting the shelves adds extra effort, it’s not nearly as awful as dealing with a disgruntled customer because you’ve run out of his favorite product. Inventory stock plans are intended to avert one of these outcomes. Step 1: Ascertain Demand\nAn intelligent inventory plan’s first rule is to stock things that customers desire and that statistics indicate are likely to be purchased. This can be determined using historical sales data, which can be obtained by tracking sales over time and logging the results in a database. Sell an average of 30 cartons of milk per day, with steady demand throughout the week. Your inventory control strategy should allow you to meet that demand while also avoiding excessive inventory. Under certain conditions, you may also wish to keep select items in stock, even if an order is weaker or less predictable. For instance, if a critical spare part for an appliance you sell is challenging to obtain promptly, stocking a limited supply can be a prudent business option. Suppose ordering that position at the last minute is prohibitively expensive, and its absence causes customers to switch providers. In that case, the storage costs may be negligible about the costs of not having it when needed. Step 2: Create a Plan for Replenishment\nSupply chain management is essential to the success of any inventory management strategy. Determine your reorder points, the time required for inventory to arrive, and any potential impediments. For example, a just-in-time inventory system works best when you are confident that you can obtain required goods promptly if necessary. Establish a broad replacement schedule for things you will require frequently. This could include daily deliveries of perishables to monthly shipments of non-perishables. Additionally, consider when you need stock replenishment on an Irregular Schedule and the associated costs. Step 3: Maintain Inventory Control\nThe tracking methods of an inventory system are only as good as the system itself. Ideally, use a point-of-sale software system to catalog your inventory and track changes in real-time, and train your personnel to use it at all times. This can be difficult in a Small Firm that prepares completed items using materials from a central inventory base, such as a restaurant, but it is still necessary. Each time a customer puts an order, keep track of which ingredients go into a meal or what goes into a complete cabinet and drain those items from your inventory. Step 4: Monitor and Adjust\nPeriodically re-examine your inventory control system to ensure that the basic assumptions remain valid. If you find that you are suddenly out of corn chips with each inventory cycle – yet have more salsa than you require – your initial demand projections may have been incorrect. Changing the order quantity for each item might help return your inventory levels to their optimal state. Developing a liquidation strategy for unsold inventory can help you move it out of storage and maximize the use of available space. For instance, end-of-season discount sales might help clear out inventory in a retail business that would otherwise linger in stock for an extended time. How do you keep track of your inventory? The easiest inventory tracking method is to manually count your stock every two weeks and compare it to sales. This is referred to as periodic inventory. Additionally, perpetual inventory utilizes an inventory management app or software incorporated with your business’s point of sale system.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:5a635d65-91b5-4cbb-818d-e594037efb57>"]},{"passage":"Inventory shrink in the United States cost the retail industry about $46.8 billion. A business must have an efficient system of inventory management. The process involves tracking the stock and inventory life cycle once it gets to your business. If you aren’t aware of your inventory, decision making becomes problematic. Whether you are a brick-and-mortar or an online retailer, inventory management is imperative. With the different techniques available, you can’t miss a solution that will work for your business. What are the secrets small businesses can use to save money on inventory management? Learn how to manage inventories more effectively now. One principle of inventory management you ought to consider is the first-in, first-out approach. This inventory method ensures you sell your old stock first. It is especially vital when selling perishable products that might end up as spoilage. The first in, first out approach, commonly referred to as FIFO, also applies to non-perishables. Items can be worn out over time, that’s why storing them for long isn’t advisable. What’s more, the packaging designs keep changing. You need to restructure your warehouse in a way that encourages FIFO. Have a back door to ensure that the new products are at the backside. When the old products are at the front, the chances are that they will sell before the new entrants. 2. Use a Real-time and Centralized Database\nThe days of pen and paper in-store inventory control are over. Companies are adopting efficient options such as Excel to manage inventory. Nonetheless, the use of paper is still evident though minimal. With today’s dynamic business environment, inventory management should be within a centralized database. A supply chain has multiple users. A centralized system will allow all users to access the database in real-time. An inventory tracking system allows you to check products from the point the supplier delivers up until it reaches the customer. You need to note down the description and value of each item. Analyze the time the supplier takes to deliver. You can see the stock at this stage and plan. The timely interventions will save you money and waste. Besides, you’ll know if it’s necessary to make any adjustments at each point of the supply chain. Recent research projects that automation will reduce the need for office support by 20%. Industries are adopting automation because of increased efficiency. If you’ve been wondering how to manage inventories, automation can be an ideal option. Inputting data manually can be time-consuming and full of errors. The process is repetitive and can be quite daunting for your employees. Save your workers the overwhelming tasks and automate some processes. Automating most of your inventory management processes can increase scale-able. If you have to email and call your suppliers and workers each day to know the amount of inventory, it means that your business isn’t scale-able. Automated systems allow you to gather information faster. Automation decreases human error that’s imminent when making manual entries. Consequently, you might undersell or oversell your items. Automation allows you to edit or upgrade inventory at any time. With automated inventory processes, you don’t need to spend hours analyzing data at the expense of other business operations. Adopt systems that will help in maximizing time. An extra hour in your business is a resource worth pursuing. 4. Stock Auditing\nThe stock audit is the physical verification of the inventory assets of a company. Auditing your inventory is not an exciting process. Yet, it is crucial for effective inventory management. Moving thousands of items increases the risk of unnoticed loses or damages. Failure to track your stock can lead to business disappointments. Imagine taking and processing a customer order only to realize the item is not in stock? You might lose customer credibility just because of not auditing your stock. Regular stock auditing notifies you on items that are out of stock. Have an up-to-date warehouse to avoid losing sales. Entrepreneurs such as restaurant owners need to make regular audits to maintain customer satisfaction. You can get restaurant inventory management software to control inventory and optimize the ordering process. Stock auditing is necessary for any industry. It will allow you to identify discrepancies and curtail cases of theft and employee malpractices. You can shop for software that can help in regular auditing to have an update on the available stock. 5.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:1f97aaec-d661-4b13-8d62-718165e892c7>"]},{"passage":"Inventory management is an essential part of doing business, whether you’re a Fortune 500 company or a mom-and-pop shop. It will come as no surprise, however, that the majority of small and medium-sized businesses don’t operate best practices when it comes to their inventory. To say that current practices are on the sloppy side would be polite. Many businesses fall into the trap of overstocking items, just in case there is a sudden glut of demand on the market. The problem with this is that it worsens the condition of the balance sheet while at the same time, forcing you to increase the space that you dedicate to storing stock. Overall, it pushes up your costs and makes your firm less competitive. In this article, we’re going to investigate how you can get inventive with inventory. So, let’s take a look. Get A Third Party To Track Stock\nIf you run a small business, then the chances are that you don’t have the time or resources to develop your own stock tracking system, allowing you to see what you’ve got in stock and what’s on order at any given moment. The good news, however, is that you don’t need to do any of this yourself: it can all be overseen by a third party. Take dental practices, for instance. Many track dental purchases using a third-party system rather than attempting to do it themselves. Not only does this help bring down costs, but it also improves the patient experience. Customers no longer have to worry about not getting the items that they need. It’s all automated, reducing the chance of error. Be Consistent With How You Manage Incoming Inventory\nLarge businesses make sure that the way that they manage incoming inventory is the same every time to avoid things like shrinkage and double counting. But small companies don’t operate at the same level of rigor. Often each individual in the firm has their own way of receiving new inventory, creating tracking issues. It’s a good idea, therefore, to develop a standard system with your staff so that each person in your organization knows how they should receive stock in the future. Doing this will help you verify that you’ve received the right items, saving you money in the long-term. Update Inventory Totals Daily\nIt might seem basic, but many small businesses don’t update their inventories at the end of the working day. This is a problem. If you don’t track sales, then you won’t know what’s sold and what needs to be ordered in larger quantities. Tracking sales allows you to see seasonal variations in demand, as well as day-to-day demand fluctuations which could help you better manage stock overall. Conduct An Inventory Audit\nDo you know what’s in your inventory? Or have you just been guessing for the last few months since you last took stock? Many successful businesses audit their inventory on a daily or weekly basis. Not only does this allow you to match up the real levels of your stock to what you think you have, but it also shows you which products are your most popular.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:31ac7c02-c97c-4d91-bd63-2eef3918c997>"]},{"passage":"A marketing communication plan is an essential tool for any firm.

Inventory planning enables businesses to purchase the appropriate amount of goods and determine how frequently to replenish. Inventory planning assists in lowering the cost of stocking things and ensuring that there is sufficient stock for manufacturing and selling items. Inventory management is a significant component of supply chain management. According to research, the 80\/20 rule implies that 80% of outcomes originate from 20% of efforts, customers, or another unit of measurement. When applied to inventories, the rule means that businesses generate approximately 80% of their revenues from 20% of their products. Benefits of Inventory Planning\nInventory control and planning are two processes part of inventory management. Planning and controlling are critical to management success, as with every management process. The rationale for such a strong emphasis on inventory is that it typically represents a corporation’s most significant cash-flow component. This is true for both purchasing and selling merchandise. As a result, inventory management directly impacts the organization’s financial health. Inventory control and planning benefit small firms in the following ways:\nInventory Management Strategies\nInventory management is a highly adaptable aspect of the company. Each business has a unique inventory control strategy. However, every organization should seek to eliminate human error as much as possible from inventory management, which includes utilizing inventory management software. Regardless of the method you employ, the following will help you manage your inventory more effectively—and increase your cash flow. 1. Six Sigma\nSix Sigma is a methodology and toolkit for enhancing business processes. It is used in inventory and supply chain management to minimize excess and obsolete write-offs. This inventory is frequently sold below cost or donated, which results in a loss of revenue for small business owners. Having the appropriate stock to meet demand minimizes waste and variation issues. Six Sigma is an excellent way of resolving inventory issues. It is orderly and dependable. 2. Set par levels\nSet par levels for each of your goods to simplify inventory management. Par levels are the bare minimum amount of product that must always be on hand. When your inventory falls below certain specified levels, it’s time to place more orders. Ideally, you’ll order the smallest quantity necessary to return above par. Par levels vary by product and determine the speed of an item sells and the time required to restock. While establishing par levels needs some study and decision-making upfront, they will streamline the ordering process. Not only will this make decision-making more accessible for you, but it will also empower your team to make decisions on your behalf. Bear in mind that circumstances change over time. Verify par levels many times a year to ensure they remain reasonable. Meanwhile, don’t be scared to tweak your par levels upward or below. First-in, first-out (FIFO) is a critical inventory management philosophy. This means that your oldest stock is sold first (first in), not your newest store. This is critical for perishable products to avoid unsellable spoiling. Additionally, FIFO is an intelligent technique for non-perishable products. If the same boxes are constantly relegated to the back, they are more prone to wear out. Also, packaging design and functionalities frequently evolve. You don’t want to ramble up with something any longer marketable. To handle a FIFO system effectively, you’ll need a well-organized warehouse. This often entails adding fresh items from the back or otherwise ensuring that existing inventory remains initially. If you’re operating with a warehousing and fulfillment provider, they’re likely already doing this, but it’s prudent to confirm. 4. Relationship management\nSuccessful inventory management requires the ability to adapt fast. Whether you need to return a slow-selling item to make place for a new product, swiftly replenish a high-volume seller, solve manufacturing concerns, or temporarily extend your storage space, it’s critical to maintain a solid relationship with your suppliers. In this manner, they’ll be more receptive to collaborating with you to resolve issues. Maintaining a positive relationship with your product suppliers, in particular, is critical. Frequently, minimum order amounts are negotiable.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:5a635d65-91b5-4cbb-818d-e594037efb57>"]},{"passage":"Effective Forecasting\nForecasting is central to inventory management. You need to predict the availability of supplies and your customer’s demands. Your inventory management needs to integrate with your business. Understand the seasons and the impact they have on your business. Will the Christmas and New Year holidays affect your product’s demand? Focus on products that are fast-moving during specific events. Research if there are any upcoming marketing events or fairs in your region. You are likely to sell more items than usual. For this reason, you might need to have a higher stock of specific products based on the type of event. To learn how to manage inventories effectively, you need precise predictions. Take advantage of the influx of customers during high peak seasons. Your business will benefit from the approach. 6. Note the Minimum Stock Level\nYou need to know the minimum stock level for timely reorders. Allowing your stock levels to go low has adverse effects on production. Understand how to go about determining the minimum stock level for smooth inventory. One of the factors to consider is the nature of the material. If you get your materials from one supplier, fixing the stock level might be unnecessary. But if you have several suppliers, you need to maintain the minimum stock level to sustain production. You ought to analyze the lead time. For a shorter lead time, the reorder level should remain constant. The longer lead times affect the supply chain because of the changing variability and demand. 7. The Pareto Principle\nStreamlining your inventory management is not a straightforward process. The scattered and varied nature of inventory makes its organization complex. The 80\/20 rule, also known as the Pareto principle, can enhance the efficiency of inventory control. The 80\/20 rule is an invaluable framework in controlling the flow of your inventory. Simply put, the 80\/20 rule means that 20% of your inventory is responsible for 80% of your profits. Your top sellers are 20%, which keeps you in business even during tough seasons. When you understand the Pareto principle, you’ll know the products that need prioritizing. Give extra attention to your top products. Monitor the stock and have these products in an easily accessible area. You will know how to manage inventories effectively once you understand the significance of the 80\/20 rule. The insights will enable you to make informed decisions on suppliers. Your top-products supplier should be reliable enough. 8. Quality Control\nQuality control is a crucial part of any business. The quality control tools in place can lead to business growth and customer satisfaction. Have a checklist so that your team can assist in confirming the quality of supplies. You can check for any signs of damage such as broken seals, tears, or leaks. Raise the issue with your supplier as you identify the damage. Selling an item that has any signs of tear can damage your credibility as the seller. Confirm the product sizes, styles, and colors. Your order should match your description. Ensure that you also confirm the prices. Maintain high-quality standards to increase your sales and satisfy your customers. Confirm the lighting, temperature, and humidity of your warehouse. Poor storage can undermine the quality of goods, whether perishable or non-perishable. Amazon’s shipping costs for the first quarter of 2019 was $9.6 billion. The expenses involved in storing and shipping products can be high. That’s why dropshipping can be an ideal way of managing your inventory more affordably. Drop-shipping allows you to sell products without necessarily holding them in your warehouse. When a consumer buys an item from your store, the manufacturer or wholesaler can do the inventory and shipping. This approach can be cost-effective because you won’t have to incur expenses on storage and several inventory processes. Dropshipping is one of the inventory methods adopted by online retailers. One inevitable problem with drop shipping is minimal involvement. For that reason, customer satisfaction might be unachievable. If a manufacturer delivers a defective product, your credibility as the seller is at stake. 10. Note the Low Turn Stock\nDo you have a product that has been lying in your warehouse for more than six months? It’s time to reconsider whether it is worth stocking the item. The more such things stay on the shelf, the more their value reduces. The excess stock is a wastage of your precious store. Consider having a promotional sale to get rid of such items. You can sell them at a 50% discount to attract more customers.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:1f97aaec-d661-4b13-8d62-718165e892c7>"]},{"passage":"Are you looking for an effective way to manage and track inventory in your business?

As your business grows or changes, so do your processes for inventory management. Below we review the basics of inventory management, common challenges companies are facing today, cost reduction strategies, and why and when to consider new inventory management software. What is inventory management? Inventory management is the process of ordering, storing and delivering products in the form of finished goods or raw materials for manufacturers. It’s all about balance – having the right product in the right quantity at the right time in the right place at the right cost. Role within the supply chain\nInventory management is a crucial part of your supply chain. It addresses how you order, maintain and deliver your inventory, and is a key component of efficient distribution operations. Your stock, or lack thereof, can have wide-reaching effects on the rest of the supply chain. Three core parts of inventory management are:\n- Purchasing: Acquiring finished goods awaiting sale or raw materials required to produce your product – the beginning of the inventory management process. - Storage: Housing your inventory before it is sold. Businesses use inventory control practices to manage inventory levels and optimize supply levels. Tools such as regular inventory counts, optimizing shipping locations and automation are ways to improve your inventory storage efforts. - Delivery: The last stage of inventory management – shipping your product to the customer. Logistics play a key role here, because evidence shows that one of the quickest ways to lose customers is through unreliable or late deliveries. Overall, inventory planning helps you avoid three major problems: stockouts, overstocking and inefficient processes. Doing regular stock counts and leveraging technology are key to efficient inventory planning. Other processes – determining your organization’s economic order quantity (or EOQ), demand forecasting, consistent employee training, quality control and more – are additional ways to prevent inventory issues. Common inventory challenges today\nThere are dozens of factors that affect your ability to manage your inventory. Common inventory management problems include:\n- Low cash flow: Holding too much inventory ties up cash that could be used in other areas of the business. - Need to bring inventory in-house: Using a third-party for your supply chain operations makes sense for some businesses. However, operational changes or business growth sometimes require you to reduce or eliminate outsourcing. Adopting best practices for inventory management will allow you to oversee your supply chain efficiently. - Stockouts or overstocking: If you have low visibility or inefficient inventory control practices, poor demand forecasting can lead to too much or too little stock on your shelves. This can lead to lost revenue. - Adding new products: Adding new products to your warehouse shelves without a system in place to locate and organize your stock can result in confusion and disorganization. Using a warehouse inventory management system, including barcoding and scanning, reduces error and increases efficiency. - Little to no reporting: If you aren’t tracking your sales and operations, you’re missing out on critical data. Good inventory planning relies on up-to-date information in order to make accurate forecasting decisions. Cost reduction strategies in inventory management\nFrom capital spent on purchasing to overhead for warehouse storage and shipping costs to deliver goods to customers, there are a lot of opportunities to reduce costs when it comes to inventory management. Dependable cost reduction strategies in inventory management include:\n- Quality control: Not only do you want to offer customers the best product, but you also want their quality to be consistent. Quality control practices help you monitor batches of inventory, make better sales order decisions, meet regulatory requirements and more, which in turn can lessen business costs. - Shipping location optimization: You can use third-party distribution as a means to fill orders, such as distribution centers, in order to hold inventory closer to the customer can reduce costs in order to earn the lowest cost and fastest delivery. - Regular inventory counts: Maintaining regularity when it comes to counting your inventory through a streamlined process attempts to identify and prevent issues before they occur. You can automate this process within an inventory management system. - Economic order quantity: EOQ is a formula for ordering inventory based on the ideal order quantity.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:cadbdecf-58c0-4239-978c-748e6b356202>"]},{"passage":"While you will count losses, you will be a lesson wiser on what’s not to stock in the future.

That's why laying the right foundation with a scalable solution is critical for growth. Luckily, Method is here to help. Below we outline what inventory management entails, its benefits, and the techniques and best practices that make for good inventory management. We'll also dig into how digitization can enable efficiency and make life easier for employees, so they can get on with taking care of patients. Inventory management is the tracking and managing of inventory from the purchase of goods through to their sale or usage. Tracking inventory allows you to identify when it's time to order and how much to order, ensuring you always have enough stock of the right supplies to service your patients. Learning to manage your inventory is the first step in gaining control of your spending so you can stay within budget, minimize waste and leverage your purchasing volumes to reduce costs and improve profits. Although your supply inventory is needed to produce revenue, it also ties up cash. Too much inventory impedes your cash flow and puts you at risk of financial hits from expired, lost, or damaged stock. This is why inventory turnover (how long your inventory sits before it is used) is a good measurement of your inventory management. Inventory management is a key component of an organization's financial health, as it ensures you carry the appropriate amount of stock to suit your business needs. Carrying too much stock ties up cash and puts you at risk of loss, damaged or expired inventory. But too little inventory can lead to stockouts, damaging your patient care and revenue. Proper inventory management can also help save you money. By understanding your usage, you can leverage your purchasing volumes for cost savings and take advantage of economies of scale. Inventory management can save you on soft costs (indirect costs such as labor) and make life easier for your employees. By removing the guesswork from buying supplies, streamlining processes, and organizing supplies, employees can more easily reorder supplies and quickly find what they need when they need it. Your dental office is a busy place. But, by taking some moments to review and establish some essential inventory management processes, you can remove some of the chaos while improving profits. It's a win-win for employees and your balance sheet, providing you with a systematic, scalable approach to managing inventory that optimizes profits and supports future growth. For dental practices, the goal of inventory management is to know your stock levels, where that stock is located, and identify when it is time to order more and in what quantities. At its most basic level, the process works by tracking your current stock levels and then adjusting inventory down, as it is used, and up, upon receipt of deliveries. As no system is perfectly executed, inventory counts will lose accuracy over time. Therefore, physical inventory counts are performed to audit, validate and adjust inventory levels as needed to increase accuracy. The process begins when you identify the requirement for a specific supply. The item is then sourced, a vendor selected, and an order placed and tracked. Upon delivery and verification of the received item, quantity, and condition (the product must be in good order and fit for use), the quantity received is then adjusted into inventory. The inventory management process also involves organizing storage and analyzing future requirements by taking into consideration factors that may impact usages such as growth, scheduled services, or holidays to ensure inventory levels suffice and are used as efficiently as possible. Below we've listed nine good-to-know inventory management terms and techniques most relevant to the dental industry. These are the methods and processes that help you to balance your priorities, keeping your practice safe from disruption while taking into consideration the availability of resources and profits.The point is not to implement all these processes at once, but to choose what is most imperative for your practice and make small but ongoing improvements over time — because small changes lead to big impacts. Based on the famous Pareto principle, the ABC analysis is a way of identifying and categorizing inventory by popularity, with A being your highest movers and C being the least.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:30866b38-eaa8-41fc-926a-ec0a418914f8>"]},{"passage":"Your (management) mileage may vary\nWhile these are the basics of inventory management for any company, the exact practices vary widely based on the industry and the product involved. A fast fashion company has to sell all of the season’s inventory within a very limited time or risk having to sell the overstock at a steeply discounted price. On the other hand, an auto parts manufacturer can keep their stock on hand longer as the demand for their product does not diminish so quickly outside of the season during which it was produced. Similarly, a beverage manufacturer has different inventory needs as either of the above examples since their product must be stored at a certain temperature and be sold before the sell by date. On a balance sheet, inventory is a current asset since the company will sell the finished product in the near future, depending on the type of product. However, this does require that companies keep careful counts of their current inventory to ensure that there are no errors in their accounting. Typically, companies use either first-in-first-out (FIFO) costing, last-in-first-out (LIFO) costing, or weighted-average costing to account for their inventory. The 4 types of inventory\nIn accounting, company’s inventory will fall into one of the following four categories:\nRaw materials are what a company uses to produce its goods. A company can either purchase and process the raw materials itself or outsource that work to a manufacturer. As the name implies, works-in-progress are the raw materials in the process of becoming finished products. They include the cost of the raw materials as well as other costs such as packaging, labor, and shipping. This type of inventory is a good that finished with production and is ready to be sold to customers\nMany people confuse merchandise with finished goods as they are both finished products that are available to consumers. However, merchandise differs in that it was purchased as a finished good from a different company than the one that intends to sell it. Inventory management techniques and best practices\nThough inventory management is a highly customizable system of practices, certain measures should be taken to minimize human error and reduce the chances of costly mistakes. Below is a list of procedures that will help any business, regardless of size or industry, to streamline their inventory control and improve efficiency. Set par levels\nPar levels are the minimum quantity of a product that you have in stock. If a product quantity falls below the par level, it’s time to buy more. This measure helps to ensure that a company is never out of stock of any particular item and can meet customer demand in a timely manner. These levels should not be set arbitrarily, however. Forecasting can help you to determine the minimum amount of product that you should have on hand at all times. This number may fluctuate by season so attention should be given to future conditions. Par levels should also be set according to the quantities of raw materials it takes to produce a finished good. These numbers should not get too high above the minimum, though, as doing so can unnecessarily tie up capital that would be better spent elsewhere. Establishing reorder points\nClosely related to par levels, an order point is the time when you replenish your stock, but unlike par levels, reorder points have to take into account shipping times and potential delays. When doing so, it is in good practice to order “safety stock”, a level of extra stock that is maintained to mitigate the risk of disruptions in the supply chain. Determining reorder points manually can be tedious, but inventory management software can automate this process to help make your inventory restocking more efficient. If inventory control is a system of maintaining enough inventory to supply a demand, then it follows that accurate forecasting of future demand is a crucial part of successful inventory management. Forecasting uses historical data of production, sales, and demand planning to infer the necessary inventory level at a certain future time. Countless variables need to be taken into account, including market trends, market growth, seasonality, consumer surveys, and more.

During this legislative session, Sen. Randi Becker R-Eatonville, proposed a bill that would allow 20 school districts of up to 2,200 students to use the four-day school week. Here, Don Kordosky, superintendent of Oregon's Oakridge School District, shares his personal experience and insights on making the switch. When considering the switch from a five-day school week to a four-day school week, one need only recall that classic saying: “Less is more.”\nAs superintendent of Oakridge School District in Oregon, I learned this through personal experience when my schools made the switch. Initially, I was against the idea. How could a four-day week possibly be in the best interest of students? But after doing the research and seeing the benefits firsthand, I became a complete supporter. The positives of the four-day week far outweigh the negatives, and the negatives can all be alleviated through well-thought-out strategies. The parents of our students, the staff, the school board, and the entire community of Oakridge reviewed the four-day week for an entire year prior to implementation. Since implementation I have become a four-day week advocate because of all the positive attributes including: better student academic performance, increased teacher vitality, increased student engagement, decreased student discipline problems, and an improvement to the overall culture of excellence for the district. Most school districts originally begin a review of the four-day school week as a strategy to address financial shortfalls. (Mine did not.) By trimming one day off the week, a school can save in bus services, cafeteria, and facilities costs. This can be especially crucial during state budget shortfalls, where K-12 funding can be in danger of cuts, and even more so for rural school districts, which must run their schools on a minimal budget. But not all school districts go to a four-day week because of money, and certainly it is not the only way a school can benefit from the change. The four-day week is not for all districts, and there are negative attributes that need to have alleviation strategies in place prior to implementation. Negative attributes include parent fears of not being able to find child care on Fridays, fatigue for students that have to attend school for longer days, and decreases in compensation for employees who lose hours. An example of an alleviation strategy for the child care concern is the offering of Red Cross Childcare First Aid certification classes for high school students. These students then became available for parents who could not find relatives or other child care on Fridays. Another strategy is offering extra duty employment for bus drivers, cooks, and custodians, who all lose significant hours. In our district we made it a practice to offer all paid athletic supervision and activity duties to the employees who lost work time prior to other employees. Regardless of the negative consequence associated with the four-day week, there are strategies to alleviate the negative impact on students, families and staff. Of note, many parents have found that eliminating the large number of half-days for students that plague five-day weeks — such as teacher work days, curriculum days, grading days, inservice days, etc. — has made finding childcare easier. With the four-day week, teachers can do their non-teaching activities on the day off, and therefore schools do not have to send children home at awkward and inconsistent times. However, what I have found is that most common four-day school week objections are derived more from a fear of change (and a indeed a reasonable concern) rather than empirical study. When scrutinized, these objections are both addressed and debunked by the switch. To demonstrate that point, here are four reasons why the four-day school week is an improvement to the five-day week. Teacher and student attendance increases. Teachers are the key to student learning, and having the regular classroom teacher in the room instead of a substitute teacher is better for kids. Because teachers are able to schedule meetings, doctor’s appointments and other possible conflicts with their teaching schedule on the extra day off, teachers are better able to provide a consistency for students. In Oakridge, the number of available work hours missed by teachers decreased significantly (21.8%) after the move to a four-day school week. Student attendance typically increases, too.\n\nBenefits of Year Round School\nThe year round school system for educational establishments has been in use for a very long time. It is basically a 10-month routine where students go to their various schools for 9 weeks followed by three weeks of break. Further down are benefits of year round school. 1. Eliminates long holidays\nThe year round school system is designed to function without lengthy fall or summer breaks like traditional systems. Rather than long holidays, students are only given a period of three weeks to enjoy their holiday. 2. Places more emphasis on studies\nStudents should be capable of getting the most out of their daily studies. When education establishments follow an agricultural kind of calendar, students do not maximize on their studying time. Most of the problems that are associated with non-year round institutions are minimized or eliminated through having all the students attending school all through the year. 3. Academic benefits\nExperts in the field of education believe that students are greatly benefited with regards to academics because of the short break periods. This is because there is no need of re-learning old material that might have been forgotten after long holidays. Teachers can also get more work done in the year round system, thereby increasing their efficiency. 4. Financial benefits\nYear round school system encourages a significant reduction in costs of child care. This is a great benefit to most parents, especially during the current tough economic climate. A major complaint concerning non-year round institutions is supervision of children throughout the summer period. Parents are forced to locate adequate childcare during this period, which can be very costly. However, this requirement is eliminated in year round schools and thus saves parents lots of money. Nevertheless, upkeep of school buildings can be very inconvenient to undertake since students are in school throughout the year.\n\n- Increased attendance rates for teachers and students\n- Boosts morale among teachers and students\n- Additional time available for professional development and teacher planning\n- Savings on transportation and heating and cooling costs\n- Decreased need for substitute teachers; savings in substitute- teacher wages\n- More efficient use of classroom time\n- Fewer discipline problems\n- Difficulty finding child care on fifth day\n- Actual savings often less than anticipated savings\n- May have negative effects on at-risk students and those with special needs\n- May be difficult for younger students\n- Decreased wages for cafeteria workers and bus drivers, who lose one day of work per week\n- Effectiveness and appropriateness in large\/urban school districts\n- Impact on student achievement\nMoreover, the educational value of the time added on to each day, to account for the lost day of instruction, hasn’t been examined in depth. “Most of the research is anecdotal,” Ms. Christie said. A report from Indiana University’s CEEP says that there is no strong evidence that a four-day week has either a positive or negative effect on achievement. In Iowa, the state education department appears to concur with Ms. Christie’s assessment of the fiscal benefits of such a change. “The state has taken the stand that if a district is doing this just to save money, that’s not something they’re OK with. Historically, they haven’t approved those calendars,” said WACO Superintendent Darrell Smith. “And I’m OK with that. Education shouldn’t be about money.”\nLooking to Improve\nThough WACO wasn’t the first district in Iowa to make the request to the state for such a schedule change, it was the first to gain approval, largely because the district’s motivation has not been budget-based. “In fact, it could end up costing us money,” said Mr. Smith. The federal No Child Left Behind Act requires that districts make “adequate yearly progress” on state academic tests. But, Mr. Smith said, “when we looked at our data, it was flat.”\nSo the district decided a four-day week might offer an opportunity to improve learning through additional assistance and educational enrichment opportunities for students and professional development for teachers. For 13 Fridays throughout the school year, beginning this week, students in all grades will have the opportunity to attend a half-day, when all teachers will be on hand for office hours, during which students can get remedial tutoring or opportunities for credit recovery. For students seeking an additional challenge, the district’s schools will also offer enrichment classes, such as music, engineering, or exploration science classes, on those Fridays or will allow for concurrent enrollment through the local community college, giving students the opportunity to acquire college credits. All other Fridays will be used for professional development, allowing teachers time to meet with fellow department members and collaboratively plan their lessons, or learn how to bring technology into their classrooms. “What we’re looking at is the opportunity to change the way our teachers teach,” said Mr. Smith. “We’re really interested in using technology as an instructional tool, and in putting it in the hands of kids. But we have to get our teachers ready first.”\nAs of last week, 95 percent of WACO's students had expressed interest in coming into school for the Friday programs. Mr. Smith said the district may use the time to bone up on computerized textbooks to develop more flexible curricula and digital assessments that will give teachers better feedback on what their students are learning and what knowledge they’re still lacking. “We don’t want to waste time teaching students what they already know. We want to teach what they don’t know,” he said. The WACO district plans to follow the schedule for at least three years to fully weigh its effectiveness based on student results from state and district assessments and teacher feedback. “[This plan] puts everybody on the same wavelength,” Mr. Smith said. “It takes everybody working toward the same thing to make something work.”\nVol. 33, Issue 04, Page 10\nGet more stories and free e-newsletters! - Aspen High School Principal\n- Aspen School District, Aspen, CO\n- Director of Schools (Superintendent)\n- Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools, Nashville, TN\n- Scale Your Impact.

Apply today!\n\nMost districts that implement a four-day week see substantial improvement in attendance at the high school level per available instructional hours (they spend more time learning, but less days at school). Attendance in some schools increased 3% as measured against available instructional hours. Contrary to fears, instructional time for students can increase from what it was before if it is the wish of the school district. By subtracting non-teaching activities from Fridays (lunch time, passing periods, transportation time, recess) and adding those paid teacher work hours to instructional hours Monday-Thursday, the amount of paid teacher time that is allocated to instruction increases. Each school day is comprised of many activities that have no direct positive correlation to student academic achievement. The time we pay teachers when they are not teaching includes before school starts (usually about 30 minutes), the time that society pays teachers after school (usually 45 minutes), passing periods (typically six passing periods of five minutes each equals 30 minutes). All of this “non-instructional time” on Fridays is eliminated and that time can be changed to instructional time on the other remaining four days. Also, the flexibility of the four-day week allows it to work around national holidays, so even if a Monday needs to be taken off — say, for Labor Day — students can still go to school for four days (Monday-Friday). The four-day school week offers four days of instruction every week, not the inconsistency of the five-day week which often has only three, three and one-half, or four days of student instruction. This is one of the keys to the four-day week: Instead of sending kids home so that teachers can do non-instructional duties you bring teachers in on Fridays to complete non-instructional tasks! On the four-day week, student discipline decreases and student engagement increases. The commonly assumed reason for the decrease in student discipline is that students are more actively engaged in more strenuous and rigorous classes than on a five-day week. Keep in mind that student seat time typically increases in the move from a five-day week to a four-day week, so claims that student discipline incidents decrease because they are in school for less time is not a viable argument. Also, teachers commonly reflect upon the change from a five-day to a four-day week that students work harder, are engaged more, and learn more. Teachers have noted that there is increased intrinsic motivation to cover material in fewer days with more instructional time, and that students adjust to increased expectations by becoming more engaged. Moreover, the extra instructional time allows teachers to better teach more complicated subjects, which can otherwise be a problem especially in math and sciences. Perhaps most importantly, teacher vitality and morale increases tremendously. Teaching is an extremely difficult job, where it is common for teachers to spend long nights and weekends assessing student work and preparing. Any teacher worth their salt does not work only “to the contract” work hours, but does everything they can in their non-working hours to provide as many learning opportunities for their students as possible. On a five-day week it is not uncommon to see teachers work late on Friday nights grading and assessing the week’s student work. Saturdays are often spent working on preparation for the next week’s worth of lessons, leaving Sundays to reinvigorate and spend time with their families. As a result, teachers often start the school year each September bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, ready to face new challenges. But by February, many become exhausted. The four-day week, even though each instructional day is longer, provides three days for teachers to complete needed work and spend some much-needed time with their families. This simple fact increases teacher morale, decreases teacher turnover, and improves teacher vitality. This leads to happier and more energetic teachers, which results in better education for students. Don't let nostalgia for an antiquated tradition cloud your mind — take a few minutes and read about the four-day week and get the facts. Plan for the negative attributes, maximize the positive attributes, and make sure that the community is thoroughly involved in the implementation process. The best way to ensure the failure of the implementation of the four-day week is to “do it to the community, instead of “doing it with the community.”\n\nDriven by hopes of cutting transportation, heating and staff costs, more and more school systems are moving to a four-day school week. Small, rural school districts have been in the vanguard of this trend, but larger urban districts are also making the shift. Right now at least twenty US states have one or more school districts operating on a four-day week, including California, Arizona and Michigan. Though shorter school weeks have been implemented from time to time in the US since the 1930s, and briefly became widespread during the “energy crisis” of the 1970s, definitive studies and reports on the impact of the shortened school week are few. This research brief is one of many that indicate that the change can often improve attendance and morale for both students and teachers. Some proponents even tout improved academic performance; especially where cost savings might forestall teacher layoffs or larger class sizes. (Most evaluations indicate that there is no net effect on achievement, though some reports have shown reduced test scores.) Opponents raise concerns about how long, tiring days in the classroom will affect young children, and point to the burdens placed on working parents to find costly daycare. What is the impact of the four-day week on tutors and tutoring? There may be some downsides the overall effect is likely to be positive. Most encouraging is the fact that some districts instituting a four-day week are explicitly inviting students who need extra help to come to school on their “off day” for tutoring sessions. In some cases, schools are reinvesting the money they’re saving to create tutoring opportunities, such as hiring one-on-one tutors for academic underachievers. Similarly, when the school system in Georgia’s Peach County moved to a four-day week, several community organizations (including Boys and Girls clubs and a church) began offering affordable tutoring on Mondays (their “off day”) for only $10 to $15. Will students have less time and energy after school for tutoring on the days when they attend classes? Some tutors may need to shift their schedules to connect with learners on their off day or on weekends – possibly making for some intensely busy days for tutors. But most schools are pushing dismissal ahead by no more than an hour, while reducing lunch and recess times. So after-school tutoring opportunities might not be adversely impacted. Tutors who connect with students online or “on demand” might benefit from an increase in business as learners move to fit tutoring into their new school-day schedules. For example, tutors who can support “digital learners” who want to learn anytime, anyplace, at their own pace, may take yet more business from traditional tutoring services due to the shorter school week. The “bottom line” for tutors is that shortening the school week can potentially create new opportunities: first by opening up a “tutoring day” on Monday or Friday, and second through increased demand for services in areas where schools are hiring tutors. As always, those who can adapt their offerings to the changing needs of students and their families will be positioned to make the most of the situation. Featured photo courtesy of Jean Valley.

It's long been embraced by some small, rural school districts. But a new Associated Press story suggests the practice is spreading amid budget pressures on school systems. Featured is a 4,000-student rural district in Peach County, Ga., where school officials reportedly shifted last year to a four-day schedule to help fill a $1 million budget shortfall. What's intriguing is that both student attendance and standardized test scores have since improved. (Apparently, each school day is longer to make up for lost time.) Across the country, more than 120 districts operate on a four-day week, the AP story says. (If only employers of education journalists would embrace this idea!) Also, over the past couple of years, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Maine have changed state law so that districts can count their academic year by hour rather than days, so that a four-day week is possible, the story says. Nevertheless, the story also identifies an Oklahoma district that plans to switch back to a five-day week, after school officials decided the approach wasn't working well for students or teachers. For a more detailed exploration of a four-day school week, check out this 2008 analysis from the Council on State Governments. Also, I came across a helpful research brief issued last year by the Center for Education Policy, Applied Research, and Evaluation at the University of Southern Maine. It notes that little research has been conducted on the impact of moving to a four-day school week on financial savings, student achievement, or other matters. \"As noted by many observers, the literature that exists on the four-day school\nweek is mainly positive, but not often peer-reviewed or scientifically based, and few summaries of this literature provide any critical analysis of the results,\" the report says. On the question of student achievement, the report says the shorter week does not appear to have a negative effect, but again cautions that much of the literature reviewed was not held to professional scrutiny. One of the most positive and ubiquitous findings from existing research, the report finds, is improved teacher and student attendance. Finally, the University of Southern Maine's analysis cautions that the actual financial savings from cutting a day out of the school week doesn't always live up to expectations, particularly if personnel costs are not reduced. The savings generally are seen in such areas as transportation, food services, and energy costs.\n\nSchool management systems have made schools much more efficient. This has proven beneficial for students, parents, teachers and administrative staff. It is designed to help students establish a system that supports quality leadership among school administrators by providing information security and an organized process. For school leaders who are new to how school management systems work, here are five benefits you can gain from purchasing a school management system. You evolve with technology;\nAdvances in technology have seen schools leap forward in terms of progress and achievement. School management systems not only facilitate administrative processes, but also ensure the efficiency of schools. It provides an efficient way to store and share information. Such systems work wonders for students as they increasingly use mobile phones and tablets for their academic activities. This gives them easy access to their records, timelines and research papers from anywhere, anytime. You save time;\nThe purpose of implementing a school management system is to create a more organized and efficient process for managing your school. The School Management System reviews resources to help you develop smart solutions to various challenges. You can also regularly share relevant information through student portals and reduce response times to organize enrollments. They can also manage their time more efficiently with the help of timers. School management systems are holistically designed to put productivity where your school needs it most. Also read more related articles from blogpendidikan.net about education. They communicate in real time;\nRelationships are one of the most important aspects of leadership in any industry, especially in schools where various stakeholders are involved. A specific student information system enables real-time communication between multiple departments and campuses, allowing for more systematic collaboration within a single integrated platform. It enables real-time correspondence between administrators, students, and parents, improving workflow, increasing efficiency, and improving process standardization across the school. You make decisions based on data;\nSchool management systems are designed to meet the different needs of your school and optimize different processes. This enables you to make smarter decisions as information about student data, faculty and staff listings, class schedules, exam schedules, whitepapers and even fees and benefits can be generated faster and more accurately. Administrators can make the most of using a school management system as it reduces the likelihood of errors and the burden of repetitive processes. You can analyze numbers and feasibility in real time to find smart solutions and focus on progress. You save money;\nAnother major benefit of using school management systems is that they improve your quality education delivery without having to increase your cost metrics. With proper assessment before installing a school management system, all key business processes are aligned for productivity. One way to use a school management system would be to automate and digitize your enrollment process by organizing it online rather than allocating costs to physical interventions. This reduces your administrative costs by completing the job with a more reliable and faster process. The school management system offers operational solutions that pave the way for sustainable growth while achieving academic goals on time. Although the needs of each school are different, the school management software is designed to meet the different needs of a particular school. This useful software streamlines processes more efficiently and pays for itself in the long run. This brings a host of benefits and efficiencies to operations, cost management, information security, marketing and most importantly student education.\n\nThe state department of education’s information manual acknowledges that childcare can be an issue, but the longer school day also reduces the time students spend home alone after school:\n“If students stayed until 4:30, the latchkey problem could be reduced. The fifth day could then be used for family, recreational or community activities. In other words, the positive characteristics experienced by small districts might hold potential for larger districts as well.”\nA page from Colorado’s book\nSome parents, like Brody Mathews, think schools should stick to the standard five-day schedule:\n“It’s what pretty much every human on earth works or goes to school for,” Mathews told NBC News. Though Mathew’s exasperation is understandable, it begs the question, why does every human work or go to school five days a week? Why shouldn’t employers also adopt a four-day work week? New Zealand business owner Andrew Barnes asked the same question and experimented with the four-day work week at his company, Perpetual Garden. He found that the shorter week boosted productivity and employee morale to such an extent that he decided to switch permanently. Not only does the 9-to-5 model take a toll on the mental health of working-class families, it impacts the environment as well. The evidence is in: if we hope to prevent a climate change catastrophe within the next 11 years, we have to end the unchecked growth attitudes which form the core of capitalism. “The need to keep the wheels of capitalism well-oiled takes precedence even against a backdrop of fires, floods and hurricanes,” writes Phil McDuff for The Guardian. 33 Missouri school districts using four-day school week this year with at least 9 more being added next year. It’s also a national news story. The NBC Today Show investigates the question: Is a 4-day school week the next trend in education https:\/\/t.co\/6pIx14Y7vp\n— Jon S Turner (@JonTurnerEdD) 21 January 2019\nThe five-day work week helps oil those wheels. If a four-day school week can reduce transportation costs (and, theoretically, carbon emissions) by as much as 20 percent, imagine if school districts around the world switched to this new schedule. In a perfect world, schools and employers around the world will follow in District 27J’s footsteps, slashing their own operating costs and helping prevent the worst effects of climate change in the process.\n\nEducation provides economic benefits to society in many ways, because well-educated citizens are better-equipped for significant economic production. People with more education have knowledge and skills to perform higher-level employment roles. Other benefits include improved health, more stable families, improved environments and lower crime rates.Continue Reading\nEmployers in a society are impacted by supply and demand of qualified workers. Higher overall education levels means more qualified workers compete for positions, and employers can put more talented people in key roles. Better organizational performance leads to stable employment and income that flows back into the community. Stable home prices and a stable business system are other economic benefits. People with higher levels of education tend to get jobs with better health benefit plans. Access to affordable healthcare makes it feasible for people to get help with illness and disease, which contributes to mitigating the potential for community outbreaks. Education also improves a person's ability to build successful relationships and cultivate effective parenting skills.

The four day work week refers to a typical work week being compressed into 32 hours while employees earn the same salary. This work model is growing in popularity, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the Motivation for a Four Day Work Week\nA few years ago, the 32-hour work week seemed like a radical idea. However, as the workforce grew in flexibility to accommodate life during COVID-19, a four day work week has become an increasingly desirable and feasible idea. So why is this such a popular idea now? Priorities are shifting. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people realized the importance of family time and adequate breaks. Additionally, many employees realized that they could successfully do their jobs from home without commuting into the office five days per week. Throughout the pandemic, we have seen firsthand that alternative working methods can be successful without sacrificing productivity. Aside from the pandemic, the traditional 40-hour work week has become an unsustainable model for many industries. The 40-hour work week first came about in 1920 when Henry Ford adopted an eight-hour work day, which was shorter than work days during the Industrial Revolution. Following the Great Depression, the government saw this 40-hour work week as a solution to boost employment rates, so it became the norm in 1940. Although this model was ideal for the jobs during this time period, rapid technology advancements have made the 40-hour work week an outdated model for most industries. Many employees are realizing that they can accomplish the same amount of work within a shorter amount of time, leaving more room for them to enjoy other parts of their lives. So what are the perks of shifting to an even shorter work week? 32-Hour Work Week Pros\nReduced Carbon Emissions: With a shorter work week, employees will spend less time and energy commuting. Being off an extra day also means one less day offices will need to power their buildings. Over time, this will reduce carbon footprints. Less Burnout: Providing employees with a substantial amount of leisure time boosts employee morale and productivity. A 32-hour work week regularly allows for more breaks and leisure time, so employees do not feel the need to take long vacations as often. They also get to enjoy a longer weekend, so they feel more refreshed by the time Monday rolls around again. Greater Productivity and Employee Engagement: Most people are concerned that working less hours would make their employees less productive, but the opposite seems to be the case. With more time to rest and relax, employees are actually more motivated and engaged with their work and can easily accomplish more in a shorter amount of time. Talent Attraction and Retention: With so many job postings across the internet, companies need to do whatever they can to stand out amongst the crowd. Jobs listed as having a shorter work week may seal the deal for candidates looking for their most suitable fit. Additionally, companies that follow a four day work week model have greater employee retention than those that follow the traditional 40-hour work week. Fewer Health Issues: Since employees have more time to relax on the weekends and enjoy leisure activities, stress is reduced, which ultimately reduces the frequency of illnesses throughout the year. A longer weekend also means more time to for rest and self care, so mental health is also improved amongst employees. Potential 32-Hour Work Week Cons\nCustomer and Client Satisfaction: Customers and clients may run into issues if they cannot get in contact with businesses five days of the week. There are various solutions that can solve this issue, such as half of the organization taking off Mondays and the other half Fridays. Not For Every Business Model: A four day work week may not suit every type of business. Although it may be ideal in theory for everyone, there are just some industries that still work best following a 40-hour work week. Coverage and Scheduling: As stated before, some companies follow a model where half of the organization is off on Mondays, while the other half is off on Fridays.\n\n### Question: What are the benefits of having four-day school weeks?","passages":[{"passage":"Crosscut recently reported on the Eatonville School District's consideration of a four-day school week, which is already being used by two rural school districts with fewer than 150 students in Eastern Washington.

But after doing the research and seeing the benefits firsthand, I became a complete supporter. The positives of the four-day week far outweigh the negatives, and the negatives can all be alleviated through well-thought-out strategies. The parents of our students, the staff, the school board, and the entire community of Oakridge reviewed the four-day week for an entire year prior to implementation. Since implementation I have become a four-day week advocate because of all the positive attributes including: better student academic performance, increased teacher vitality, increased student engagement, decreased student discipline problems, and an improvement to the overall culture of excellence for the district. Most school districts originally begin a review of the four-day school week as a strategy to address financial shortfalls. (Mine did not.) By trimming one day off the week, a school can save in bus services, cafeteria, and facilities costs. This can be especially crucial during state budget shortfalls, where K-12 funding can be in danger of cuts, and even more so for rural school districts, which must run their schools on a minimal budget. But not all school districts go to a four-day week because of money, and certainly it is not the only way a school can benefit from the change. The four-day week is not for all districts, and there are negative attributes that need to have alleviation strategies in place prior to implementation. Negative attributes include parent fears of not being able to find child care on Fridays, fatigue for students that have to attend school for longer days, and decreases in compensation for employees who lose hours. An example of an alleviation strategy for the child care concern is the offering of Red Cross Childcare First Aid certification classes for high school students. These students then became available for parents who could not find relatives or other child care on Fridays. Another strategy is offering extra duty employment for bus drivers, cooks, and custodians, who all lose significant hours. In our district we made it a practice to offer all paid athletic supervision and activity duties to the employees who lost work time prior to other employees. Regardless of the negative consequence associated with the four-day week, there are strategies to alleviate the negative impact on students, families and staff. Of note, many parents have found that eliminating the large number of half-days for students that plague five-day weeks — such as teacher work days, curriculum days, grading days, inservice days, etc. — has made finding childcare easier. With the four-day week, teachers can do their non-teaching activities on the day off, and therefore schools do not have to send children home at awkward and inconsistent times. However, what I have found is that most common four-day school week objections are derived more from a fear of change (and a indeed a reasonable concern) rather than empirical study. When scrutinized, these objections are both addressed and debunked by the switch. To demonstrate that point, here are four reasons why the four-day school week is an improvement to the five-day week. Teacher and student attendance increases. Teachers are the key to student learning, and having the regular classroom teacher in the room instead of a substitute teacher is better for kids. Because teachers are able to schedule meetings, doctor’s appointments and other possible conflicts with their teaching schedule on the extra day off, teachers are better able to provide a consistency for students. In Oakridge, the number of available work hours missed by teachers decreased significantly (21.8%) after the move to a four-day school week. Student attendance typically increases, too.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e211e027-e45b-4d40-9de0-8293e4a42775>"]},{"passage":"Benefits of Year Round School\nThe year round school system for educational establishments has been in use for a very long time. It is basically a 10-month routine where students go to their various schools for 9 weeks followed by three weeks of break. Further down are benefits of year round school. 1. Eliminates long holidays\nThe year round school system is designed to function without lengthy fall or summer breaks like traditional systems. Rather than long holidays, students are only given a period of three weeks to enjoy their holiday. 2. Places more emphasis on studies\nStudents should be capable of getting the most out of their daily studies. When education establishments follow an agricultural kind of calendar, students do not maximize on their studying time. Most of the problems that are associated with non-year round institutions are minimized or eliminated through having all the students attending school all through the year. 3. Academic benefits\nExperts in the field of education believe that students are greatly benefited with regards to academics because of the short break periods. This is because there is no need of re-learning old material that might have been forgotten after long holidays. Teachers can also get more work done in the year round system, thereby increasing their efficiency. 4. Financial benefits\nYear round school system encourages a significant reduction in costs of child care. This is a great benefit to most parents, especially during the current tough economic climate. A major complaint concerning non-year round institutions is supervision of children throughout the summer period. Parents are forced to locate adequate childcare during this period, which can be very costly. However, this requirement is eliminated in year round schools and thus saves parents lots of money. Nevertheless, upkeep of school buildings can be very inconvenient to undertake since students are in school throughout the year.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:30faa79d-c903-4348-9e4d-e070d1bcc0b1>"]},{"passage":"- Increased attendance rates for teachers and students\n- Boosts morale among teachers and students\n- Additional time available for professional development and teacher planning\n- Savings on transportation and heating and cooling costs\n- Decreased need for substitute teachers; savings in substitute- teacher wages\n- More efficient use of classroom time\n- Fewer discipline problems\n- Difficulty finding child care on fifth day\n- Actual savings often less than anticipated savings\n- May have negative effects on at-risk students and those with special needs\n- May be difficult for younger students\n- Decreased wages for cafeteria workers and bus drivers, who lose one day of work per week\n- Effectiveness and appropriateness in large\/urban school districts\n- Impact on student achievement\nMoreover, the educational value of the time added on to each day, to account for the lost day of instruction, hasn’t been examined in depth. “Most of the research is anecdotal,” Ms. Christie said. A report from Indiana University’s CEEP says that there is no strong evidence that a four-day week has either a positive or negative effect on achievement. In Iowa, the state education department appears to concur with Ms. Christie’s assessment of the fiscal benefits of such a change. “The state has taken the stand that if a district is doing this just to save money, that’s not something they’re OK with. Historically, they haven’t approved those calendars,” said WACO Superintendent Darrell Smith. “And I’m OK with that. Education shouldn’t be about money.”\nLooking to Improve\nThough WACO wasn’t the first district in Iowa to make the request to the state for such a schedule change, it was the first to gain approval, largely because the district’s motivation has not been budget-based. “In fact, it could end up costing us money,” said Mr. Smith. The federal No Child Left Behind Act requires that districts make “adequate yearly progress” on state academic tests. But, Mr. Smith said, “when we looked at our data, it was flat.”\nSo the district decided a four-day week might offer an opportunity to improve learning through additional assistance and educational enrichment opportunities for students and professional development for teachers. For 13 Fridays throughout the school year, beginning this week, students in all grades will have the opportunity to attend a half-day, when all teachers will be on hand for office hours, during which students can get remedial tutoring or opportunities for credit recovery. For students seeking an additional challenge, the district’s schools will also offer enrichment classes, such as music, engineering, or exploration science classes, on those Fridays or will allow for concurrent enrollment through the local community college, giving students the opportunity to acquire college credits. All other Fridays will be used for professional development, allowing teachers time to meet with fellow department members and collaboratively plan their lessons, or learn how to bring technology into their classrooms. “What we’re looking at is the opportunity to change the way our teachers teach,” said Mr. Smith. “We’re really interested in using technology as an instructional tool, and in putting it in the hands of kids. But we have to get our teachers ready first.”\nAs of last week, 95 percent of WACO's students had expressed interest in coming into school for the Friday programs. Mr. Smith said the district may use the time to bone up on computerized textbooks to develop more flexible curricula and digital assessments that will give teachers better feedback on what their students are learning and what knowledge they’re still lacking. “We don’t want to waste time teaching students what they already know. We want to teach what they don’t know,” he said. The WACO district plans to follow the schedule for at least three years to fully weigh its effectiveness based on student results from state and district assessments and teacher feedback. “[This plan] puts everybody on the same wavelength,” Mr. Smith said. “It takes everybody working toward the same thing to make something work.”\nVol. 33, Issue 04, Page 10\nGet more stories and free e-newsletters! - Aspen High School Principal\n- Aspen School District, Aspen, CO\n- Director of Schools (Superintendent)\n- Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools, Nashville, TN\n- Scale Your Impact.

Attendance in some schools increased 3% as measured against available instructional hours. Contrary to fears, instructional time for students can increase from what it was before if it is the wish of the school district. By subtracting non-teaching activities from Fridays (lunch time, passing periods, transportation time, recess) and adding those paid teacher work hours to instructional hours Monday-Thursday, the amount of paid teacher time that is allocated to instruction increases. Each school day is comprised of many activities that have no direct positive correlation to student academic achievement. The time we pay teachers when they are not teaching includes before school starts (usually about 30 minutes), the time that society pays teachers after school (usually 45 minutes), passing periods (typically six passing periods of five minutes each equals 30 minutes). All of this “non-instructional time” on Fridays is eliminated and that time can be changed to instructional time on the other remaining four days. Also, the flexibility of the four-day week allows it to work around national holidays, so even if a Monday needs to be taken off — say, for Labor Day — students can still go to school for four days (Monday-Friday). The four-day school week offers four days of instruction every week, not the inconsistency of the five-day week which often has only three, three and one-half, or four days of student instruction. This is one of the keys to the four-day week: Instead of sending kids home so that teachers can do non-instructional duties you bring teachers in on Fridays to complete non-instructional tasks! On the four-day week, student discipline decreases and student engagement increases. The commonly assumed reason for the decrease in student discipline is that students are more actively engaged in more strenuous and rigorous classes than on a five-day week. Keep in mind that student seat time typically increases in the move from a five-day week to a four-day week, so claims that student discipline incidents decrease because they are in school for less time is not a viable argument. Also, teachers commonly reflect upon the change from a five-day to a four-day week that students work harder, are engaged more, and learn more. Teachers have noted that there is increased intrinsic motivation to cover material in fewer days with more instructional time, and that students adjust to increased expectations by becoming more engaged. Moreover, the extra instructional time allows teachers to better teach more complicated subjects, which can otherwise be a problem especially in math and sciences. Perhaps most importantly, teacher vitality and morale increases tremendously. Teaching is an extremely difficult job, where it is common for teachers to spend long nights and weekends assessing student work and preparing. Any teacher worth their salt does not work only “to the contract” work hours, but does everything they can in their non-working hours to provide as many learning opportunities for their students as possible. On a five-day week it is not uncommon to see teachers work late on Friday nights grading and assessing the week’s student work. Saturdays are often spent working on preparation for the next week’s worth of lessons, leaving Sundays to reinvigorate and spend time with their families. As a result, teachers often start the school year each September bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, ready to face new challenges. But by February, many become exhausted. The four-day week, even though each instructional day is longer, provides three days for teachers to complete needed work and spend some much-needed time with their families. This simple fact increases teacher morale, decreases teacher turnover, and improves teacher vitality. This leads to happier and more energetic teachers, which results in better education for students. Don't let nostalgia for an antiquated tradition cloud your mind — take a few minutes and read about the four-day week and get the facts. Plan for the negative attributes, maximize the positive attributes, and make sure that the community is thoroughly involved in the implementation process. The best way to ensure the failure of the implementation of the four-day week is to “do it to the community, instead of “doing it with the community.”","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e211e027-e45b-4d40-9de0-8293e4a42775>"]},{"passage":"Driven by hopes of cutting transportation, heating and staff costs, more and more school systems are moving to a four-day school week. Small, rural school districts have been in the vanguard of this trend, but larger urban districts are also making the shift. Right now at least twenty US states have one or more school districts operating on a four-day week, including California, Arizona and Michigan. Though shorter school weeks have been implemented from time to time in the US since the 1930s, and briefly became widespread during the “energy crisis” of the 1970s, definitive studies and reports on the impact of the shortened school week are few. This research brief is one of many that indicate that the change can often improve attendance and morale for both students and teachers. Some proponents even tout improved academic performance; especially where cost savings might forestall teacher layoffs or larger class sizes. (Most evaluations indicate that there is no net effect on achievement, though some reports have shown reduced test scores.) Opponents raise concerns about how long, tiring days in the classroom will affect young children, and point to the burdens placed on working parents to find costly daycare. What is the impact of the four-day week on tutors and tutoring? There may be some downsides the overall effect is likely to be positive. Most encouraging is the fact that some districts instituting a four-day week are explicitly inviting students who need extra help to come to school on their “off day” for tutoring sessions. In some cases, schools are reinvesting the money they’re saving to create tutoring opportunities, such as hiring one-on-one tutors for academic underachievers. Similarly, when the school system in Georgia’s Peach County moved to a four-day week, several community organizations (including Boys and Girls clubs and a church) began offering affordable tutoring on Mondays (their “off day”) for only $10 to $15. Will students have less time and energy after school for tutoring on the days when they attend classes? Some tutors may need to shift their schedules to connect with learners on their off day or on weekends – possibly making for some intensely busy days for tutors. But most schools are pushing dismissal ahead by no more than an hour, while reducing lunch and recess times. So after-school tutoring opportunities might not be adversely impacted. Tutors who connect with students online or “on demand” might benefit from an increase in business as learners move to fit tutoring into their new school-day schedules. For example, tutors who can support “digital learners” who want to learn anytime, anyplace, at their own pace, may take yet more business from traditional tutoring services due to the shorter school week. The “bottom line” for tutors is that shortening the school week can potentially create new opportunities: first by opening up a “tutoring day” on Monday or Friday, and second through increased demand for services in areas where schools are hiring tutors. As always, those who can adapt their offerings to the changing needs of students and their families will be positioned to make the most of the situation. Featured photo courtesy of Jean Valley.

It's long been embraced by some small, rural school districts. But a new Associated Press story suggests the practice is spreading amid budget pressures on school systems. Featured is a 4,000-student rural district in Peach County, Ga., where school officials reportedly shifted last year to a four-day schedule to help fill a $1 million budget shortfall. What's intriguing is that both student attendance and standardized test scores have since improved. (Apparently, each school day is longer to make up for lost time.) Across the country, more than 120 districts operate on a four-day week, the AP story says. (If only employers of education journalists would embrace this idea!) Also, over the past couple of years, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Maine have changed state law so that districts can count their academic year by hour rather than days, so that a four-day week is possible, the story says. Nevertheless, the story also identifies an Oklahoma district that plans to switch back to a five-day week, after school officials decided the approach wasn't working well for students or teachers. For a more detailed exploration of a four-day school week, check out this 2008 analysis from the Council on State Governments. Also, I came across a helpful research brief issued last year by the Center for Education Policy, Applied Research, and Evaluation at the University of Southern Maine. It notes that little research has been conducted on the impact of moving to a four-day school week on financial savings, student achievement, or other matters. \"As noted by many observers, the literature that exists on the four-day school\nweek is mainly positive, but not often peer-reviewed or scientifically based, and few summaries of this literature provide any critical analysis of the results,\" the report says. On the question of student achievement, the report says the shorter week does not appear to have a negative effect, but again cautions that much of the literature reviewed was not held to professional scrutiny. One of the most positive and ubiquitous findings from existing research, the report finds, is improved teacher and student attendance. Finally, the University of Southern Maine's analysis cautions that the actual financial savings from cutting a day out of the school week doesn't always live up to expectations, particularly if personnel costs are not reduced. The savings generally are seen in such areas as transportation, food services, and energy costs.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:39e4263e-6eb5-4a7f-90a9-a501eac204e9>"]},{"passage":"School management systems have made schools much more efficient. This has proven beneficial for students, parents, teachers and administrative staff. It is designed to help students establish a system that supports quality leadership among school administrators by providing information security and an organized process. For school leaders who are new to how school management systems work, here are five benefits you can gain from purchasing a school management system. You evolve with technology;\nAdvances in technology have seen schools leap forward in terms of progress and achievement. School management systems not only facilitate administrative processes, but also ensure the efficiency of schools. It provides an efficient way to store and share information. Such systems work wonders for students as they increasingly use mobile phones and tablets for their academic activities. This gives them easy access to their records, timelines and research papers from anywhere, anytime. You save time;\nThe purpose of implementing a school management system is to create a more organized and efficient process for managing your school. The School Management System reviews resources to help you develop smart solutions to various challenges. You can also regularly share relevant information through student portals and reduce response times to organize enrollments. They can also manage their time more efficiently with the help of timers. School management systems are holistically designed to put productivity where your school needs it most. Also read more related articles from blogpendidikan.net about education. They communicate in real time;\nRelationships are one of the most important aspects of leadership in any industry, especially in schools where various stakeholders are involved. A specific student information system enables real-time communication between multiple departments and campuses, allowing for more systematic collaboration within a single integrated platform. It enables real-time correspondence between administrators, students, and parents, improving workflow, increasing efficiency, and improving process standardization across the school. You make decisions based on data;\nSchool management systems are designed to meet the different needs of your school and optimize different processes. This enables you to make smarter decisions as information about student data, faculty and staff listings, class schedules, exam schedules, whitepapers and even fees and benefits can be generated faster and more accurately. Administrators can make the most of using a school management system as it reduces the likelihood of errors and the burden of repetitive processes. You can analyze numbers and feasibility in real time to find smart solutions and focus on progress. You save money;\nAnother major benefit of using school management systems is that they improve your quality education delivery without having to increase your cost metrics. With proper assessment before installing a school management system, all key business processes are aligned for productivity. One way to use a school management system would be to automate and digitize your enrollment process by organizing it online rather than allocating costs to physical interventions. This reduces your administrative costs by completing the job with a more reliable and faster process. The school management system offers operational solutions that pave the way for sustainable growth while achieving academic goals on time. Although the needs of each school are different, the school management software is designed to meet the different needs of a particular school. This useful software streamlines processes more efficiently and pays for itself in the long run. This brings a host of benefits and efficiencies to operations, cost management, information security, marketing and most importantly student education.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:3c90e62b-6751-4587-81a9-4877b59cac6f>"]},{"passage":"The state department of education’s information manual acknowledges that childcare can be an issue, but the longer school day also reduces the time students spend home alone after school:\n“If students stayed until 4:30, the latchkey problem could be reduced.

New Zealand business owner Andrew Barnes asked the same question and experimented with the four-day work week at his company, Perpetual Garden. He found that the shorter week boosted productivity and employee morale to such an extent that he decided to switch permanently.

The four day work week refers to a typical work week being compressed into 32 hours while employees earn the same salary. This work model is growing in popularity, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the Motivation for a Four Day Work Week\nA few years ago, the 32-hour work week seemed like a radical idea. However, as the workforce grew in flexibility to accommodate life during COVID-19, a four day work week has become an increasingly desirable and feasible idea. So why is this such a popular idea now? Priorities are shifting. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people realized the importance of family time and adequate breaks. Additionally, many employees realized that they could successfully do their jobs from home without commuting into the office five days per week. Throughout the pandemic, we have seen firsthand that alternative working methods can be successful without sacrificing productivity. Aside from the pandemic, the traditional 40-hour work week has become an unsustainable model for many industries. The 40-hour work week first came about in 1920 when Henry Ford adopted an eight-hour work day, which was shorter than work days during the Industrial Revolution. Following the Great Depression, the government saw this 40-hour work week as a solution to boost employment rates, so it became the norm in 1940. Although this model was ideal for the jobs during this time period, rapid technology advancements have made the 40-hour work week an outdated model for most industries. Many employees are realizing that they can accomplish the same amount of work within a shorter amount of time, leaving more room for them to enjoy other parts of their lives. So what are the perks of shifting to an even shorter work week? 32-Hour Work Week Pros\nReduced Carbon Emissions: With a shorter work week, employees will spend less time and energy commuting. Being off an extra day also means one less day offices will need to power their buildings. Over time, this will reduce carbon footprints. Less Burnout: Providing employees with a substantial amount of leisure time boosts employee morale and productivity. A 32-hour work week regularly allows for more breaks and leisure time, so employees do not feel the need to take long vacations as often. They also get to enjoy a longer weekend, so they feel more refreshed by the time Monday rolls around again. Greater Productivity and Employee Engagement: Most people are concerned that working less hours would make their employees less productive, but the opposite seems to be the case. With more time to rest and relax, employees are actually more motivated and engaged with their work and can easily accomplish more in a shorter amount of time. Talent Attraction and Retention: With so many job postings across the internet, companies need to do whatever they can to stand out amongst the crowd. Jobs listed as having a shorter work week may seal the deal for candidates looking for their most suitable fit. Additionally, companies that follow a four day work week model have greater employee retention than those that follow the traditional 40-hour work week. Fewer Health Issues: Since employees have more time to relax on the weekends and enjoy leisure activities, stress is reduced, which ultimately reduces the frequency of illnesses throughout the year. A longer weekend also means more time to for rest and self care, so mental health is also improved amongst employees. Potential 32-Hour Work Week Cons\nCustomer and Client Satisfaction: Customers and clients may run into issues if they cannot get in contact with businesses five days of the week. There are various solutions that can solve this issue, such as half of the organization taking off Mondays and the other half Fridays. Not For Every Business Model: A four day work week may not suit every type of business. Although it may be ideal in theory for everyone, there are just some industries that still work best following a 40-hour work week. Coverage and Scheduling: As stated before, some companies follow a model where half of the organization is off on Mondays, while the other half is off on Fridays.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:9da88ea1-5c86-4076-9bce-64ae8c506b79>"]}]}

Keeping track of all of them can be a real pain, especially if you have to log in and out of each one every time you want to use it. Fortunately, there's a solution to this problem: API integrations. API integrations allow you to connect two or more applications so that they can share data and information with each other. This means that you can access all of your applications from one central location, and you don't have to remember multiple login credentials. There are a few things to keep in mind when setting up API integrations:\nMake sure that the applications you're connecting support API integration. Not all applications do, so it's important to check before you get started. You can usually tell if this is the case if they have an \"API\" link at the bottom of their homepage. Determine what kind of data you want to share between the applications. Some integrations only allow for basic data sharing, while others allow for more complex interaction. Determine how the applications will share data. Will data be automatically synced between the applications, or will you need to manually transfer data? Set up a secure connection between the applications. This is important to prevent unauthorized access to your data. Once you've considered these factors, you're ready to start setting up API integrations. There are a few different ways to do this, so we'll outline a few of the most popular methods. One of the most popular methods for setting up API integrations is using a service like Zapier or IFTTT. These services allow you to connect a wide variety of applications and services, and they make it easy to automate tasks between them. For example, you could use Zapier to automatically add new contacts from your CRM to your email marketing list. Another popular method for setting up API integrations is through custom development. This is typically more complex than using a service like Zapier or IFTTT, but it gives you more control over the integration. If you're not a developer, you can hire someone to develop the integration for you. Once you've set up your API integration, it's important to test it to make sure everything is working as expected. You don't want to wait until you need to use the integration to find out that there are problems. API integrations can simplify your life by allowing you to connect all of your favorite applications and services in one place. By taking the time to set up an integration, you can save yourself a lot of time and frustration in the long run.\n\nPostie is direct mail for digital marketers.

Getting out with your dog and enjoying the warm weather is the ultimate reward after being trapped inside all winter with a bored dog. From lake visits and dog friendly patios to hiking the Metroparks, if you have an active dog, you (and your dog) have no excuse to be bored during the summer months.\nIn addition to all of the outdoor activities you can do with your dog, local rescue groups host a number of fun dog friendly events throughout the summer. Here are the Top 5 Dog Friendly Events this summer you don’t want to miss:\nBring your dog along to watch you sip on some wine and tour the vineyards of Grand River Cellars in Madison. Held on June 13, Woof, Wag and Wine includes a tour of the winery, live music and auctions. Admission is $20 a person (which includes a Muddy Paws wine sampling) and proceeds go to the Lake Humane Society.\nAlthough the Indians aren’t doing their Puppypalooza event this year, you still have some opportunities to take your dog to a baseball game. Both the Lake Erie Captains and the Akron Rubber Ducks hold dog friendly nights. The Lake Erie Captains will hold their Bark at the Park on July 28, August 11 and August 23, and the Akron Rubber Ducks’ dog friendly games will be June 10 and August 19. A portion of the proceeds from each game will benefit local rescue groups.\nThe largest dog friendly event in Ohio, Canine Fun Days, is held every August at the Metroparks Polo Fields in Moreland Hills. This two day party for dogs and their people is organized by Greyhound Adoption of Ohio and includes swimming, dock diving, contests and more. This year’s event will be held August 16 and 17th.\nEvery Tuesday throughout the summer Tremont Taphouse hosts a dog friendly Yappy Hour to benefit local rescue groups. Bring your dog along for some patio time while you enjoy the Taphouse’s large selection of beer and delicious food. Adoptable dogs will also make appearances, so bring your dog-less friends along to meet their new best friend! Several other bars and wineries host Yappy Hours throughout the summer as well; check out my dog friendly events calendar for other upcoming dates.\nThis annual event, Dog Paddle and Pet-a-Palooza, is held at the Hinckley Reservation to benefit the Cleveland APL and the Medina County SPCA. Bring your dog to enjoy a swim at Ledge Pool as well as a mini dog fair including vendors and exhibitors. Also, dogs are allowed on rowboats at Hinckley Reservation, so if your dog doesn’t enjoy swimming you can rent a rowboat and take him for a boat ride instead.\nAnn McDonald is the writer behind the website Dogs in the CLE, the source for what to do with your dog in Cleveland.

And these days it is not uncommon to see many dogs enjoying the summer months al fresco chilling with their human family. With popular walking neighborhoods like Tremont, Ohio City, Cleveland Heights, and East 4th it seems only natural for our dogs to partake in our brunches or patio day drinking. This is a list of ten patio's that have become the standard for dog friendly. The Top 10 Dog Friendly Patios in Cleveland\n\nEating out with your pup can be a fun experience, but not all restaurants are dog friendly. Not all dogs are restaurant friendly. With that said, there are plenty of places that welcome dogs with open arms! Here’s a guide to the best dog-friendly restaurants in your city. Types of Dog Friendly Restaurants\nThe type of dog friendly restaurant you choose will depend on the type of atmosphere you’re looking for. For those who prefer an outdoor setting, consider an eatery with a patio or deck. These locations usually have plenty of room for Fido to roam around and will often provide water bowls or treats for your pup. If you’re looking for something more formal, look for a restaurant with pet-friendly seating inside. Some places even offer special menu items specifically designed for dogs! Anytime you offer a dog anything other than raw meat, make sure you do your research to ensure the food is safe for your furry friend. Things to Consider When Choosing a Dog Friendly Restaurant\nWhen choosing a restaurant to take your pup, there are several things to keep in mind. First and foremost is safety—make sure you choose an establishment that takes safety precautions seriously, such as providing non-slip flooring or keeping food away from Fido’s reach. You should also keep an eye out for any regulations that may be in place—some cities have ordinances against pets in food establishments, so make sure you know the rules before you go! And lastly, don’t forget about comfort—you want both you and your pet to be comfortable throughout the meal. That could mean leaving the leash attached. If you’re looking for a place to take your pup for lunch or dinner, many restaurants have dog-friendly outdoor patios. These patios are typically well shaded and provide seating away from the hustle and bustle of the street. Most of these patios also offer water bowls so your pup can stay hydrated during their mealtime. Be sure to call ahead and check if the restaurant has any restrictions on bringing pets into their outdoor patio before heading out for a bite. Dog Friendly Cafes\nIf you’re looking for something more casual than a restaurant, then why not try out one of the many dog friendly cafes? Dog friendly cafes are generally smaller establishments that offer food items such as sandwiches, salads, coffee, and pastries. Many of these cafe locations are situated in areas with high foot traffic so it’s easy to take your pup along for some R&R after work or school. Additionally, many of these cafes have outdoor seating areas which are great for people watching with your pooch by your side! Dog Parks & Pet Stores\nAnother option is to visit one of the many local dog parks or pet stores in your area. Dog parks offer plenty of space for you and your pup to get some exercise while pet stores usually have designated areas where pets are allowed inside. While at either location make sure you bring extra treats so you can reward Fido after a fun day out! Researching Restaurants Ahead of Time\nMost pet-friendly restaurants will have information about their policies listed on their websites or social media accounts. This makes researching ahead of time easy and convenient — simply search for “dog friendly restaurants near me” online and browse through the results. You should be able to find all the information you need before visiting a restaurant in person (such as whether they require pooches to be leashed or not). If there isn’t any info available online, then don’t hesitate to call the restaurant and ask directly. Checking Restaurant Reviews\nOnce you’ve identified a few potential places to take your pup, take the time to read some customer reviews — especially those written by dog owners who have taken their pets there before. By doing so, you can get a better sense of which restaurants are most accommodating towards canine guests, as well as which ones might be worth avoiding altogether. Customer reviews can also provide helpful tips such as where the best seating areas are located (e.g., outside patios), or which items on the menu are particularly popular among doggy diners. Ask Other Dog Owners for Recommendations\nIf you know other dog owners in your area who often bring their pets out when eating out, don’t hesitate to ask them for recommendations or advice. They may know of some hidden gems that aren’t always listed on Yelp or Google Maps! More importantly, they can share first-hand stories about their own experiences at certain establishments, especially the doggy menu — something that no amount of research can replace.\n\nWant to include your pet in more of your activities?

A number of parks, schools, hotels and hospitals now allow dogs, and a wide variety of businesses let both employees and customers bring their dogs with them. There are still a lot of places that are off limits to our four-legged family members, and this continues to affect most people with dogs. I was recently at a local bookstore that allows dogs, but the café inside the store is for people only. There is a very nice sign saying that health codes prohibit them from welcoming dogs to the café, though they are welcome in the rest of the store. The staff works very hard to accommodate people who have brought their dog to the bookstore and would like a cup of coffee by bringing their orders out of the café and into the main part of the bookstore. I’m sure many dog guardians skip the café because they can’t sit down and enjoy a drink if accompanied by a dog. However, many people do request “delivery” to the main part of the store, and seem appreciative of the option. Years ago I worked with a woman who would hardly go anywhere without her dog. She brought him to work, which was allowed as we worked at a facility that provided dog training, dog grooming and dog day care. This woman never went to the movies because her dog was not allowed to go with her, and never ate in restaurants for the same reason. She made some concessions to practicality such as going to the grocery store or on other errands alone, but she generally only went where her dog was allowed to come, too. She made decisions that many could consider extreme, but they certainly worked for her and for her dog. Her social life was affected by her unwillingness to go places without her dog, but she has always been very happy with her choices and has a good life. Are there any places you don’t go because of restrictions that prevent your dog from coming, too?\n\nWant to include your pet in more of your activities?

Things To Consider When Taking Your Dog To A Pet Friendly Restaurant\nTaking your dog to dog friendly restaurants can be a fun experience if you take the right precautions beforehand. Make sure you keep your leashed dog near you at all times and you only take well behaved dogs with you, as this makes for a dog friendly atmosphere that will make your and other guests’ trips enjoyable. Not everyone is a dog lover, so be conscious of that when taking your pet to local restaurants. Consider bringing something for your dog to do, such as a chew toy or dog treats, so they have something familiar from home. It’s also important to bring water and dog bags to pick up any messes in order to maintain an enjoyable environment for everyone. With these simple items in mind, you’ll be ready for a fun day out with your pup! A pet friendly restaurant can make dining out with your furry friend much more enjoyable.\n\nThe first thing we usually do after we arrive in a city and are comfortably checked into our room is to go out and try to find a place to eat. You certainly don’t want to be forced to leave your animal alone or order room service because you haven’t taken time to find restaurants or cafes nearby that will allow dogs or cats. Finding one or two or three pet friendly eateries isn’t as hard as might think. First, look for places that have outdoor seating and there’s a good chance you’ll be in luck. Find a few places like this and eating out will be a joy. Most likely the proprietors will remember your pet and treat you like royalty. Also, other customers will inevitably come over and tell you that they left their pet behind and will want to say hello. Of course, there’s always a chance of a calamitous, table-knocking-down episode brought on by undisciplined pets (or people) which might be remembered with laughs later on but is not something you really want to happen. We don’t think it will. In general, we’ve found that there’s nothing better than a well-behaved pet at a café to start conversations and to get to know people you might never have spoken to if you didn’t have your best friend along. © 2019 petswelcome.com, Inc.

They get directly to enthusiastic sniffing. Of course, dogs can get away with the sort of behavior that would not end well if the mammal at the other end of the leash tried it. The humans do their share of scouting the opposite sex, but they trade puppy tales instead of sniffing each other. In an age of craft beer and effete cocktails, some pubs literally are deciding to go to the dogs. From Oregon to Florida, bar owners are finding that mixing drinking and dogs is good for business, especially in Denver, which surveys rank among the country's top dog-friendliest cities. And not just those little dogs that fit in purses, either. Service dogs have always been allowed in these establishments. But dog bars also welcome Great Pyrenees, Bernese Mountain Dogs, mutts, Tibetan Terriers and just about any other relatively obedient canine with a cold, inquisitive nose. Denver dogs and their owners can visit at least three local bars that offer a canine play area — the Bark Bar, the Watering Bowl and the Ugly Dog Sports Bar. Local 46currently allows dogs on-leash in its backyard beer garden, and the Tavern Uptownplans a remodel that will include a self-service bar and a dog patio. The Bark Bar and the Watering Bowl both offer fenced outdoor spaces that are the equivalent of small dog parks, with outdoor seating and tactfully placed plastic bags and scoops. \"A dog park is what inspired us — my husband and I were at the Berkeley dog park with our two dogs, and he wanted a coffee, and I wanted a craft beer,\" said owner Catherine Peters. \"I said, 'Wouldn't it be great if there was a dog park bar?' and he said, 'Sweetie, you should do that.' And we opened on Christmas Day last year. Best Christmas present ever!\" It's a concept whose time has come, says University of Denver adjunct professor Shadi Farhangrazi. \"Look at the demographic: In Colorado, we love our dogs, we love being outside, and we love fun, so this idea really is quite innovative. I'd compare it to other innovative trends, like having a Starbucks inside a Barnes & Noble so people buy coffee but maybe a book or magazine also, and having a cafe inside a supermarket like Whole Foods.\"\n\nWhere Can I Eat Out With My Dog? Welcome to this week's installment of Ask the Critics. If you have a question you'd like answered in a future column, email us or leave the query in the comments. Today, we deal with a question that always comes up with the advent of warm weather:\nWhich restaurants will allow me to bring my dog? Technically, dogs aren't allowed at restaurants, but some places will let you park Fluffy at your table in an outdoor seating section. Eateries with an enclosure around their sidewalk seating are likely to ask you to hitch your dog outside the railing, and then will seat you right next to it. Plus, some bars welcome dogs inside. At Pastis, your dog is welcome to sit outside the sidewalk barricade, and staff will bring a bowl of water if you ask. Similarly, Toby's Public House, the excellent wood-oven pizza spot in Greenwood Heights, has a deck where your dog can sit right next to you, though outside the railing. The staff are very friendly about it, and will also bring water for the dog. Dog-friendly outdoor seating areas without enclosures are harder to find because, technically, they're against code. Tabla is more hospitable than most, allowing pooches to sit with their owners in the outdoor cafe that overlooks Madison Square Park. And Pao, the comfortable Portuguese spot in the West Village, will let canines sit with you at the sidewalk tables. For a glass of wine in a relaxed atmosphere, check out Von, which welcomes dogs inside. For a big-ass cocktail at a fair price, head to Brooklyn's Quarter Bar. If you get tipsy, your dog can walk you home. The dog-friendliness of these venues has all been recently verified, but it's always a good idea to call before you go. You never know when a grouchy manager might be on duty. If you know of other good, dog-friendly eateries, let us know in the comments.\n\nWelcome to this week’s installment of Ask the Critics.

And these days it is not uncommon to see many dogs enjoying the summer months al fresco chilling with their human family.

The Top 10 Dog Friendly Patios in Cleveland","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:14c2d80b-228d-44ce-a376-42e98661d6d4>"]},{"passage":"Eating out with your pup can be a fun experience, but not all restaurants are dog friendly. Not all dogs are restaurant friendly. With that said, there are plenty of places that welcome dogs with open arms! Here’s a guide to the best dog-friendly restaurants in your city. Types of Dog Friendly Restaurants\nThe type of dog friendly restaurant you choose will depend on the type of atmosphere you’re looking for. For those who prefer an outdoor setting, consider an eatery with a patio or deck. These locations usually have plenty of room for Fido to roam around and will often provide water bowls or treats for your pup. If you’re looking for something more formal, look for a restaurant with pet-friendly seating inside. Some places even offer special menu items specifically designed for dogs! Anytime you offer a dog anything other than raw meat, make sure you do your research to ensure the food is safe for your furry friend. Things to Consider When Choosing a Dog Friendly Restaurant\nWhen choosing a restaurant to take your pup, there are several things to keep in mind. First and foremost is safety—make sure you choose an establishment that takes safety precautions seriously, such as providing non-slip flooring or keeping food away from Fido’s reach. You should also keep an eye out for any regulations that may be in place—some cities have ordinances against pets in food establishments, so make sure you know the rules before you go! And lastly, don’t forget about comfort—you want both you and your pet to be comfortable throughout the meal. That could mean leaving the leash attached. If you’re looking for a place to take your pup for lunch or dinner, many restaurants have dog-friendly outdoor patios. These patios are typically well shaded and provide seating away from the hustle and bustle of the street. Most of these patios also offer water bowls so your pup can stay hydrated during their mealtime. Be sure to call ahead and check if the restaurant has any restrictions on bringing pets into their outdoor patio before heading out for a bite. Dog Friendly Cafes\nIf you’re looking for something more casual than a restaurant, then why not try out one of the many dog friendly cafes? Dog friendly cafes are generally smaller establishments that offer food items such as sandwiches, salads, coffee, and pastries. Many of these cafe locations are situated in areas with high foot traffic so it’s easy to take your pup along for some R&R after work or school. Additionally, many of these cafes have outdoor seating areas which are great for people watching with your pooch by your side! Dog Parks & Pet Stores\nAnother option is to visit one of the many local dog parks or pet stores in your area. Dog parks offer plenty of space for you and your pup to get some exercise while pet stores usually have designated areas where pets are allowed inside. While at either location make sure you bring extra treats so you can reward Fido after a fun day out! Researching Restaurants Ahead of Time\nMost pet-friendly restaurants will have information about their policies listed on their websites or social media accounts. This makes researching ahead of time easy and convenient — simply search for “dog friendly restaurants near me” online and browse through the results. You should be able to find all the information you need before visiting a restaurant in person (such as whether they require pooches to be leashed or not). If there isn’t any info available online, then don’t hesitate to call the restaurant and ask directly. Checking Restaurant Reviews\nOnce you’ve identified a few potential places to take your pup, take the time to read some customer reviews — especially those written by dog owners who have taken their pets there before. By doing so, you can get a better sense of which restaurants are most accommodating towards canine guests, as well as which ones might be worth avoiding altogether. Customer reviews can also provide helpful tips such as where the best seating areas are located (e.g., outside patios), or which items on the menu are particularly popular among doggy diners. Ask Other Dog Owners for Recommendations\nIf you know other dog owners in your area who often bring their pets out when eating out, don’t hesitate to ask them for recommendations or advice. They may know of some hidden gems that aren’t always listed on Yelp or Google Maps! More importantly, they can share first-hand stories about their own experiences at certain establishments, especially the doggy menu — something that no amount of research can replace.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:6acc9498-93c7-4e61-9aac-d0c7b68ab4f0>"]},{"passage":"Want to include your pet in more of your activities?

Camping is one of my absolute favorite ways to spend a long weekend, but I know that for a lot of people, just the idea of spending a night or two outdoors sounds nothing short of horrendous – and, yes, without the proper precautions, it can be!\nBut the more you camp, the more you learn, and I thought it would be fun to share some of the tips and tricks I’ve learned (usually the hard way) to make your next camping trip the best one yet.\nAnd if something still goes wrong? Trust me when I say that some of my favorite camping memories are the ones where everything went to shit (like that time we ended up eating eggs at a Denny’s at midnight amid a torrential downpour that flooded the campground’s latrines…it’s funny now, though!).\nSo, without further ado, here are my camping essentials!\n1. Pack LAYERS.\nThere is nothing worse than being cold (and I lived in freakin’ Sweden for nearly ten years, so I know). Even if you think bringing that extra sweater or pair of leggings seems ridiculous, just do it. You’ll be so grateful later. I always do like my dear Mama, and wear a pair of long underwear when camping, as it is much easier to remove layers if you’re too hot. Also, sleeping bags may keep your body warm, but I always bring an extra pair of socks, gloves, and a hat to keep my extremities warm and toasty all night long. As we say in Sweden, there’s no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothes!\n2. Anticipate darkness.\nThis may sound totally obvious, but, out in nature, there is this concept of night, and, away from the modern luxury of electricity, night time is usually quite DARK. While this means you’ll get to see some incredible stars, I always, always, always seem to forget how hard it is to manage in pitch black darkness. Plan ahead and bring as many flashlights, torches, headlamps (the best), as you can because you will need them. One of my favorite camping hacks? Strap a headlamp onto a gallon jug of water or milk for an instant portable lamp.\n3. Pack sustainable food.\nWhen I say ‘sustainable’, I’m referring to food that will a) survive no or little refrigeration, b) be able to handle lots of movement, and c) still be appealing three days later. I always take a cooler when I camp, but, depending on the length of your trip, that may or may not ensure that all your food stays fresh the whole time. My favorite thing to do is to plan all of the meals ahead of time, and shop accordingly. Also, make sure to prep your food for easy cleanup\/cooking time. If you want eggs for breakfast, crack them into a ziplock bag for easy transportation along with any cheese, salt\/pepper\/veggies, etc., that you want to add. If you want to grill hamburgers for dinner, wash, chop, and separate all your ingredients ahead of time to avoid doing so at the campsite. My favorite foods to bring on a camping trip are make-ahead breakfast burritos, kettle corn, foil-wrapped dinners, hot dogs\/bratwursts, sandwich supplies (pb&j, ham and cheese, turkey, sprouts, mustard, etc.), and, of course, s’mores!\n4. Embrace the gross\nDepending on your level of comfort when it comes to roughing-it, camping usually means that you’ll be shower-less for the next few days. Instead of focusing on how gross that might be, just embrace it! It’s not like you have a job interview later that day or something (and if you do, reschedule immediately). Instead, focus on little ways to feel fresh sans shower, like brushing your teeth (totally doable with a bottle of water), changing your underwear daily (seriously, this makes a HUGE difference), and, if you have long hair, putting it up into an up-do of some kind (I usually go for french braids) to keep it off your face. In a few days’ time, you’ll be back in your lovely, warm shower, promise!\n5. Anticipate problems\nKnock on wood, you won’t need to break out your first-aid-kit or car jack, but I’m a firm believer in the idea that being unprepared is just asking for trouble. Always let someone know where you’re going (especially if going alone, which I do not recommend unless you’re a seasoned outdoors-person, and even then, remember this???). Make sure you always have:\n- Lots of water\n- Toilet paper\n- A good knife\n- A lighter or box of matches\n- First aid kit\n- A map and compass\n- Storm-proof outdoor gear\n- A way of contacting someone in case of emergency (phone, walkie-talkie, etc.)\n6. Bring some of the good stuff\nCamping is a bit of work, but that doesn’t mean that it shouldn’t be enjoyable! I always make sure to bring a good bottle of wine or flask of whiskey, a pack of playing cards, a frisbee or soccer ball, some comfortable lawn chairs, a hammock, a good book, and a portable radio for some of the quieter moments.\nAlways make sure to research where you’re going and what there is nearby before leaving for your trip. Your phone will most likely not work once there, so having some print outs of fun activities in the area can be great when you want to explore your surroundings. It’s also a good idea to know where the nearest store or town is in case of emergency (like running out of toilet paper!) or if you just absolutely need a ‘real’ cup of coffee in the morning.\nDo you have any good camping tips to share?

This is mentioned as one of the key ways to maintain personal hygiene during camping trips, along with brushing teeth with bottled water and putting long hair up in styles like French braids.","answer":"When camping without access to a shower, changing underwear daily can still be considered important for maintaining personal hygiene. While it may not be as critical as when you have daily shower access, maintaining daily changes can help prevent skin irritation, bacterial growth, and unpleasant odors.\n\nHere are a few reasons why daily changes are still beneficial:\n\n1. **Prevents Skin Irritation:** Moist and dirty underwear can cause chafing and skin irritation, which can be uncomfortable, especially during physical activities.\n\n2. **Reduces Bacterial Growth:** Underwear can harbor bacteria, particularly in areas where sweat and moisture accumulate. Daily changes can help reduce the buildup of bacteria.\n\n3. **Minimizes Odor:** While you may not notice the same level of body odor in a natural environment as you would in a more populated area, changing underwear daily can help minimize any potential smell.\n\n4. **Maintains Comfort:** Clean underwear can contribute to overall comfort, allowing you to focus more on enjoying your camping experience rather than being distracted by discomfort.\n\nHowever, the necessity of daily changes can depend on factors such as the intensity of your activities, the weather conditions, and your personal sensitivity to body odor. In some cases, you might get away with changing less frequently if you're careful about hygiene and your activities are less physically demanding.\n\nTo maintain good hygiene while camping:\n\n- **Pack Extra Underwear:** Always bring more underwear than you think you'll need.\n- **Use Breathable Fabrics:** Opt for moisture-wicking fabrics that can help keep you drier.\n- **Clean Up Regularly:** If possible, take a quick wipe-down with baby wipes or use a stream to clean off after activities.\n- **Dispose of Waste Properly:** Ensure that you properly dispose of used items to avoid attracting wildlife.\n\nRemember, personal hygiene is about feeling comfortable and being considerate of those around you. Balancing hygiene practices with the realities of camping can help you enjoy your time outdoors without compromising your health or comfort.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: Many people sleep too much.

Let’s face it, we travelers put up with a lot of aggravation on the road: lost baggage, missing passports, loud hostels, etc. . . . And we see a lot of things that bother us around the world: obnoxious tourists, environmental degradation, the plight of the world’s poor. But there’s one thing that annoys us the most, and which is constantly on our minds. Yes, I’m talking about your underwear. How many times have you, midway through your trip, with nary a laundry machine to be had, thought to yourself, “I wish I didn’t have to change my underwear so darn often!”\nWell, you are in luck, for our nation’s best and brightest scientists, chemical engineers, microbiologists, and PHD-toting eggheads have put aside some time (finally!) from their — let’s face it, kind of fruitless — endeavors such as finding a cure for HIV\/AIDS, solving economic disparity, and addressing climate change, and finally tackled that age-old world issue: the irritation of changing your underwear. I introduce to you the Give-N-Go underwear from ExOficio: the world’s first underwear that does not need to be washed (very often). To you, the intrepid traveler, who asks, “Why do I need to change my underwear so often?”, ExOficio says, “Don’t!”\nThese space-age undies’ tag line, in Draper-esque fashion are: “17 countries. 6 Weeks. One pair of underwear. Okay, maybe two.” But we know they really mean one, right? A look at their package reveals what exactly these bad boys do: “[Give-N-Go’s are] high performance and low maintenance. Treated with Aegis Microbe Shield they’re odor resistant and perfect for tricky climates and active adventures.” Please, no more selling is necessary. You had me at the words “Microbe Shield.”\nAnd forget the Parisian runways, this line of underwear (and I’m not making this up) is advertised as being both “field tested and approved” by the African Wildlife Foundation, an organization you may not have realized was so intimately involved in the world of haute coutre. But let’s not take their word for it, let’s take a look at some of the (incredibly) non-anonymous customer reviews left on the underwear’s Amazon page (And for those keeping score, there were 28 five-star, one four-star, and only one one-star reviews). One very proud owner remarked, “You can live on two pairs of these — wash one at night, wear the other. Wrap it in a towel, stomp dry — should be ready in a few hours.” And here you’ve just been using your towel for your body all this time. And how about this astonished user: “Care for this item is almost too simple. I wash mine in the bathroom sink with a very small amount of detergent and hang dry for a few hours and they are ready to go again.” Oh to be that bathroom-goer lucky enough to get to use that sink right after him. (Well, at least he said he uses detergent.) And finally, where there’s a happy underwear wearer, there’s a happy mom. This from a proud mother who got her entire family in on the act: “This item was purchased for my son who was traveling to another country. He thanked me so much upon his return. He was with a group that was camping for several weeks and said this boxer brief was the most comfortable to wear, the most convenient to launder and quickest to dry. I then purchased one for another son who travels; he agrees.” It’s stories like these that get recounted during funeral eulogies and around the buffet table at wakes by bereaved children; this mother has certainly fulfilled her parental duties.\n\nHand hygiene assignment essay being male working in an icu working during weekdays rather than the weekend a custom essay sample on hand hygiene assignment for only $1638 $139\/page.

Lastly, consider the amount of independence you need and level of comfort without support during these times.\n\nIn 2007, the National Public Radio reported that not all Americans value cleanliness. Based on reports, just 66 percent of males remember to wash their hands when necessary; women did better at 88 percent. However, in 2013, The New York Times reported the contrary. It states that Americans might be too obsessed with hygiene; this obsession is brought about by advertising. But obsessed or not, there is no debate that hygiene is important. Neglecting hygiene results in hygiene-related diseases, and this is proven by research. What is hygiene? Hygiene is a general term used to describe the things we do to keep ourselves healthy through cleanliness. There are different types of hygiene: personal and environmental. Personal hygiene is aimed at an individual’s cleanliness. It includes taking care of the body through washing and bathing and keeping all parts of it clean. The hair, teeth, feet, and nails are part of a person’s body that must be kept clean at all times. Personal hygiene also covers grooming. This is why taking care of your clothing and personal appearance is also part of it. Personal hygiene is also associated with etiquette, and this is why people should cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing. In the US, a sign of bad personal hygiene is perceived through body odor. As most Americans are sensitive to scent, they tend to get away from people who have a bad body odor. This is why Americans regularly practice taking a shower, brushing their teeth, changing their clothes, and using deodorants or antiperspirants: to prevent getting that stinky smell. One can say that having personal hygiene is also a sign of respect. As we live in a world where interactions are part of life, having proper personal hygiene is respecting other people while sharing space. It is also protecting them from hygiene-related diseases that one might carry because of lack of hygiene. Environmental hygiene has two categories: domestic and community hygiene. Domestic or home hygiene involves taking care of the home’s cleanliness by using cleaning agents and storing food and waste disposal. Domestic hygiene also includes making sure that households pest like rats and roaches do not invade the home. On the other hand, community hygiene covers proper sanitation and disposal of human wastes, as well as prevention of having vectors in the community that can transmit diseases. Community hygiene also involves controlling one’s contribution to water and air pollution. How important is hygiene? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that hygiene is crucial in preventing the spread of diseases. Some hygiene-related diseases are diarrhea, tooth decay, head lice, and scabies. Harvard adds that hygiene is the simplest way to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The simple act of washing hands can help kill the virus; however, the university reminds people that this act must be done regularly and thoroughly. Aside from preventing diseases and medical conditions, proper personal hygiene improves self-esteem and social relationships. Hence, we can conclude that hygiene is not only important for physical wellness but also social and mental wellness. Best hygiene practices\nMost of the hygiene practices must already be a daily routine. However, for some who have forgotten, here are quick reminders on improving personal hygiene and overall wellness. As consistently mentioned above, washing hands is crucial to avoid spreading disease to yourself and other people. Whenever you do a “dirty job” like taking out the trash and picking out clothes, you should wash your hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds. A good thing is to sing “Happy Birthday” while washing hands. Just like washing your hands is important, washing your intimate parts is important, too. Having a bidet toilet seat can help in that extra fresh feeling when using the toilet. It can prevent UTI, too. Using bidets ensures that bacteria is removed from the body; this bacteria is responsible for urinary tract infections. Taking regular showers can cleanse the whole body. It helps remove dirt and dead skin cells in one’s body that ultimately leads to disease spread prevention. After taking a shower, wear clean clothes; dirty clothes are good breeding grounds for bacteria. Oral hygiene is also important. You might already know from experience that if you have a toothache from decaying teeth, it’s hard to function and perform daily activities, too. Aside from this, having poor oral hygiene turns people off.\n\n…Or some combination and on and on. Or multiple layers and steps. Hell, I’d not be surprised if the self-experiment didn’t work on grounds of pure selection bias: as in pain-in-the-ass. Or, let me put it this way. What I’ve found over these 18 months is that I never even thought of the money I was saving. Hell, a decent sized bottle of shampoo and body wash would last me months anyway. Oh, and then there’s the travel size versions. No, what has made this experience oh so satisfying is that I don’t have to worry about any of that anymore — ever. Don’t have to buy it. Don’t have to carry it. Don’t ever run out of it. Don’t have to get it tossed in the dumpster by TSA goons. So what it boils down to is that this has been such a tremendous experience on the pure grounds of liberation. Now, I can wash up anywhere, anytime there’s a shower, lake, river or stream at hand and feel completely normal about it, not as though it’s the best I can do because I don’t have a big bag of \"personal hygiene\" products immediately at hand. The other time I was amused in all of this was at the MovNat experience this summer. Here we were doing a pretty good job of simulating a number of aspects of, when not a complete existence in the wild, at least a minimal one. This included, among other things, going barefoot most of the time, shirtless, real food only, with only water to drink (no coffee, tea, alcohol), minimal lighting at night…\nMe? When I went to shower I took a towel. That’s it and I even had to borrow it from Erwan because I’d simply forgotten to pack one. And yet here were all these other folks marching off to the showers with their large bags in tote and in a couple of cases — surprising enough for guys in itself — there was a cornucopia of hygiene products from shaving materials to shampoos, body washes, scrubs, conditioners, lotions…and on and on. Far from being close to a wild human experience, it wasn’t even close to minimalist. As a final aspect I’d thought of — but not seen addressed yet that I could recall — I looked at the comments on the boingboing post yesterday and found this one, posted months later. For the most part of what i’ve read of these comments, it seems that no-one has yet addressed that a persons state of health and diet is the major contributer to body odours. You can be a person that bathes, shampoos and deodorises regularly but still stink offensively to high heaven from poor food choices, lack of fruit and veg, too much processed junk and the degenerative diseases developed. On the other hand, you can be a person who is physically active on a daily basis, eats only fresh food, lightly cooked meats and seafoods, avoids grain foods (because we are NOT birds) and smell perfectly fine from not using cosmetics and soaps, etc. To determine\/decide if another potential mates’ odour was offensive or not is one of many important evolutionary ‘tools’ to ensure that humans mated with other humans who were in good health with good genes. Cosmetics were originally developed to mask a persons poor health, rather than making the effort to improve their health (more like ignorance in the face of decadence). We almighty Human Beings forget that we are just another animal on this planet, and how many of them (animals) do you see using processed foods, soaps and clothing? Compare the health of a chimpanzee (our closest biological relative) to most humans, these chimps are much better off than we are without our modern vices. We apply chemicals to our skin, eat food from sources that are not digestable in their natural state, technology that does all our moving\/movement for us, yet still have it in our heads that we are ‘smarter’ than other living organisms on this planet. Our sense of ‘smart’ seems like a hell of a lot of ‘stupid’ to me. If our animal friends shared the same voice and could point and laugh, we would never hear the end of it, except we are HARMING THEM in all these processes.

Paying attention to your skin, hair, and teeth will certainly be appreciated by those around you on a particular backpacking or camping expedition. Whether you’re camping, hiking, fishing, or backpacking, the normal rules of hygiene still apply. Here’s how to keep practicing great hygiene while you’re out and about in among the outdoors. Flickr Creative Common License: Archigeek\nDry socks are very valuable when venturing throughout the outdoors. A dry, clean pair of socks is so easy to find normally but not when you’re miles from your sock drawer. Throw a few more pairs of socks in your sack before heading out. Regardless of your activity or destination, you’ll be moving a lot and on your feet a majority of the time. Wet, dirty socks attract bacteria, which leads to a host of foot issues that can last well beyond the excursion. You can hang a pair on the outside of your pack as to quicken the drying process in emergency situations. Take along a small bottle of hand sanitizer, using it frequently after touching trees, plants, and going in lakes. You will be using your hands to cook food, clean equipment, and eat. Therefore, you’ll lessen the likelihood of ingesting and coming in contact with bacteria if you make it a habit to clean your hands with the sanitizer. It’s an easy way to avoid sickness, which would be unfortunate, especially while on the trip. You won’t be able to take a shower but that doesn’t mean you won’t be able to keep yourself clean. Take along a package of baby wipes to use to clean your entire body. You’ll be pleasantly surprised to find how refreshed and cleaner you’ll feel after wiping yourself down. Nothing can replace a nice, hot shower but baby wipes do well to remove dirt and bacteria from your body parts. You can achieve the same effect with a bottle of alcohol and cotton balls but it’s easier to use the wipes. You don’t want to neglect your mouth and teeth because you’re away from your bathroom sink. Regardless of your location, it’s still important to brush, floss, and gargle with mouthwash. Place the dental essentials in your backpack. Be mindful of when spitting out your mouthwash and toothpaste. You don’t want it running into a natural body of water. Also, the smell can attract wild animals so dispose of your mouthfuls a distance away from the camp. Read on the topic further if you decide to choose dental powder rather than paste. Those with long hair may want to braid or keep it up or back with a hair tie. Those who are going to be out in the wilderness for a while may want to cover oily hair with a headband. Also, running baby powder through the hair will help with soaking up some of the excess oil. You could bring a travel-size bottle of shampoo and quickly wash your hair out with the help of a bottle of water. It’s necessary to know of the things you can go without in addition to minding the things you’ll need. For example, you don’t need to wear deodorant; in fact, it’s suggested to leave it at home because the scent will help attract bugs and wild animals. The same goes for perfumes and cologne. There is no need for it in the wilderness and it can work against you. Of course, you don’t want to smell dirty; that’s why you’ll keep your armpits clean with baby wipes and a bit of powder. You’ll get used to the ‘natural’ smell of your skin after a day or two. The weight of your backpack and the number of needed items is always a concern to those who are hiking and camping. You’ll want to balance packing too many clothes with knowing when to change and clean what you do bring. Replace sweaty shirts and pants each night with fresh clothing. It’s best to change before going to sleep for the night. Sleeping in dirty clothes makes your sleeping bag smell and it also introduces the opportunity for rashes and skin problems. Of course, you’ll want to consider the type of material. Some materials wick away sweat while feeling light on the skin. Cotton will make a sweaty shirt stick to your skin and does not feel comfortable in the rain.\n\nNeed an argumentative essay on Personal hygiene. Needs to be 16 pages. Please no plagiarism.

Sweaty undies\nWomen and men who tend to sweat should change their underwear regularly — twice a day, as opposed to once a day for people who typically stay dry. And anyone who works out should put on a clean pair of undies as soon as they’re able. “A warm, moist environment is the perfect place for yeast to grow,” says Dr. Moore, who recommends that sweat-prone people invest in underwear made of moisture-wicking material and avoid cotton underwear, which tends to stay wet once it gets wet. “All of these problems are compounded if you have incontinence to any degree — even a drop or two,” says Dr. Moore. “When you work out, you can try wearing a panty liner. That way, if you’re not in a position to change underwear, at least you can change the panty liner or take it off.”\n\n### Question: Is changing underwear daily considered particularly important for maintaining personal hygiene while camping without shower access?","passages":[{"passage":"Many people sleep too much.

Answer: No! Let’s face it, we travelers put up with a lot of aggravation on the road: lost baggage, missing passports, loud hostels, etc. . . . And we see a lot of things that bother us around the world: obnoxious tourists, environmental degradation, the plight of the world’s poor. But there’s one thing that annoys us the most, and which is constantly on our minds. Yes, I’m talking about your underwear. How many times have you, midway through your trip, with nary a laundry machine to be had, thought to yourself, “I wish I didn’t have to change my underwear so darn often!”\nWell, you are in luck, for our nation’s best and brightest scientists, chemical engineers, microbiologists, and PHD-toting eggheads have put aside some time (finally!) from their — let’s face it, kind of fruitless — endeavors such as finding a cure for HIV\/AIDS, solving economic disparity, and addressing climate change, and finally tackled that age-old world issue: the irritation of changing your underwear. I introduce to you the Give-N-Go underwear from ExOficio: the world’s first underwear that does not need to be washed (very often). To you, the intrepid traveler, who asks, “Why do I need to change my underwear so often?”, ExOficio says, “Don’t!”\nThese space-age undies’ tag line, in Draper-esque fashion are: “17 countries. 6 Weeks. One pair of underwear. Okay, maybe two.” But we know they really mean one, right? A look at their package reveals what exactly these bad boys do: “[Give-N-Go’s are] high performance and low maintenance. Treated with Aegis Microbe Shield they’re odor resistant and perfect for tricky climates and active adventures.” Please, no more selling is necessary. You had me at the words “Microbe Shield.”\nAnd forget the Parisian runways, this line of underwear (and I’m not making this up) is advertised as being both “field tested and approved” by the African Wildlife Foundation, an organization you may not have realized was so intimately involved in the world of haute coutre. But let’s not take their word for it, let’s take a look at some of the (incredibly) non-anonymous customer reviews left on the underwear’s Amazon page (And for those keeping score, there were 28 five-star, one four-star, and only one one-star reviews). One very proud owner remarked, “You can live on two pairs of these — wash one at night, wear the other. Wrap it in a towel, stomp dry — should be ready in a few hours.” And here you’ve just been using your towel for your body all this time. And how about this astonished user: “Care for this item is almost too simple. I wash mine in the bathroom sink with a very small amount of detergent and hang dry for a few hours and they are ready to go again.” Oh to be that bathroom-goer lucky enough to get to use that sink right after him. (Well, at least he said he uses detergent.) And finally, where there’s a happy underwear wearer, there’s a happy mom. This from a proud mother who got her entire family in on the act: “This item was purchased for my son who was traveling to another country. He thanked me so much upon his return. He was with a group that was camping for several weeks and said this boxer brief was the most comfortable to wear, the most convenient to launder and quickest to dry. I then purchased one for another son who travels; he agrees.” It’s stories like these that get recounted during funeral eulogies and around the buffet table at wakes by bereaved children; this mother has certainly fulfilled her parental duties.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:cf33f244-213e-42f9-91db-92167a2ada02>"]},{"passage":"Hand hygiene assignment essay being male working in an icu working during weekdays rather than the weekend a custom essay sample on hand hygiene assignment for only $1638 $139\/page.

Based on reports, just 66 percent of males remember to wash their hands when necessary; women did better at 88 percent. However, in 2013, The New York Times reported the contrary. It states that Americans might be too obsessed with hygiene; this obsession is brought about by advertising. But obsessed or not, there is no debate that hygiene is important. Neglecting hygiene results in hygiene-related diseases, and this is proven by research. What is hygiene? Hygiene is a general term used to describe the things we do to keep ourselves healthy through cleanliness. There are different types of hygiene: personal and environmental. Personal hygiene is aimed at an individual’s cleanliness. It includes taking care of the body through washing and bathing and keeping all parts of it clean. The hair, teeth, feet, and nails are part of a person’s body that must be kept clean at all times. Personal hygiene also covers grooming. This is why taking care of your clothing and personal appearance is also part of it. Personal hygiene is also associated with etiquette, and this is why people should cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing. In the US, a sign of bad personal hygiene is perceived through body odor. As most Americans are sensitive to scent, they tend to get away from people who have a bad body odor. This is why Americans regularly practice taking a shower, brushing their teeth, changing their clothes, and using deodorants or antiperspirants: to prevent getting that stinky smell. One can say that having personal hygiene is also a sign of respect. As we live in a world where interactions are part of life, having proper personal hygiene is respecting other people while sharing space. It is also protecting them from hygiene-related diseases that one might carry because of lack of hygiene. Environmental hygiene has two categories: domestic and community hygiene. Domestic or home hygiene involves taking care of the home’s cleanliness by using cleaning agents and storing food and waste disposal. Domestic hygiene also includes making sure that households pest like rats and roaches do not invade the home. On the other hand, community hygiene covers proper sanitation and disposal of human wastes, as well as prevention of having vectors in the community that can transmit diseases. Community hygiene also involves controlling one’s contribution to water and air pollution. How important is hygiene? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that hygiene is crucial in preventing the spread of diseases. Some hygiene-related diseases are diarrhea, tooth decay, head lice, and scabies. Harvard adds that hygiene is the simplest way to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The simple act of washing hands can help kill the virus; however, the university reminds people that this act must be done regularly and thoroughly. Aside from preventing diseases and medical conditions, proper personal hygiene improves self-esteem and social relationships. Hence, we can conclude that hygiene is not only important for physical wellness but also social and mental wellness. Best hygiene practices\nMost of the hygiene practices must already be a daily routine. However, for some who have forgotten, here are quick reminders on improving personal hygiene and overall wellness. As consistently mentioned above, washing hands is crucial to avoid spreading disease to yourself and other people. Whenever you do a “dirty job” like taking out the trash and picking out clothes, you should wash your hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds. A good thing is to sing “Happy Birthday” while washing hands. Just like washing your hands is important, washing your intimate parts is important, too. Having a bidet toilet seat can help in that extra fresh feeling when using the toilet. It can prevent UTI, too. Using bidets ensures that bacteria is removed from the body; this bacteria is responsible for urinary tract infections. Taking regular showers can cleanse the whole body. It helps remove dirt and dead skin cells in one’s body that ultimately leads to disease spread prevention. After taking a shower, wear clean clothes; dirty clothes are good breeding grounds for bacteria. Oral hygiene is also important. You might already know from experience that if you have a toothache from decaying teeth, it’s hard to function and perform daily activities, too. Aside from this, having poor oral hygiene turns people off.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:8966706c-efe6-4dc8-90d8-a1012608d4a6>"]},{"passage":"…Or some combination and on and on. Or multiple layers and steps. Hell, I’d not be surprised if the self-experiment didn’t work on grounds of pure selection bias: as in pain-in-the-ass. Or, let me put it this way. What I’ve found over these 18 months is that I never even thought of the money I was saving. Hell, a decent sized bottle of shampoo and body wash would last me months anyway. Oh, and then there’s the travel size versions. No, what has made this experience oh so satisfying is that I don’t have to worry about any of that anymore — ever. Don’t have to buy it. Don’t have to carry it. Don’t ever run out of it. Don’t have to get it tossed in the dumpster by TSA goons. So what it boils down to is that this has been such a tremendous experience on the pure grounds of liberation. Now, I can wash up anywhere, anytime there’s a shower, lake, river or stream at hand and feel completely normal about it, not as though it’s the best I can do because I don’t have a big bag of \"personal hygiene\" products immediately at hand. The other time I was amused in all of this was at the MovNat experience this summer. Here we were doing a pretty good job of simulating a number of aspects of, when not a complete existence in the wild, at least a minimal one. This included, among other things, going barefoot most of the time, shirtless, real food only, with only water to drink (no coffee, tea, alcohol), minimal lighting at night…\nMe? When I went to shower I took a towel. That’s it and I even had to borrow it from Erwan because I’d simply forgotten to pack one. And yet here were all these other folks marching off to the showers with their large bags in tote and in a couple of cases — surprising enough for guys in itself — there was a cornucopia of hygiene products from shaving materials to shampoos, body washes, scrubs, conditioners, lotions…and on and on. Far from being close to a wild human experience, it wasn’t even close to minimalist. As a final aspect I’d thought of — but not seen addressed yet that I could recall — I looked at the comments on the boingboing post yesterday and found this one, posted months later. For the most part of what i’ve read of these comments, it seems that no-one has yet addressed that a persons state of health and diet is the major contributer to body odours. You can be a person that bathes, shampoos and deodorises regularly but still stink offensively to high heaven from poor food choices, lack of fruit and veg, too much processed junk and the degenerative diseases developed. On the other hand, you can be a person who is physically active on a daily basis, eats only fresh food, lightly cooked meats and seafoods, avoids grain foods (because we are NOT birds) and smell perfectly fine from not using cosmetics and soaps, etc. To determine\/decide if another potential mates’ odour was offensive or not is one of many important evolutionary ‘tools’ to ensure that humans mated with other humans who were in good health with good genes. Cosmetics were originally developed to mask a persons poor health, rather than making the effort to improve their health (more like ignorance in the face of decadence). We almighty Human Beings forget that we are just another animal on this planet, and how many of them (animals) do you see using processed foods, soaps and clothing? Compare the health of a chimpanzee (our closest biological relative) to most humans, these chimps are much better off than we are without our modern vices. We apply chemicals to our skin, eat food from sources that are not digestable in their natural state, technology that does all our moving\/movement for us, yet still have it in our heads that we are ‘smarter’ than other living organisms on this planet. Our sense of ‘smart’ seems like a hell of a lot of ‘stupid’ to me. If our animal friends shared the same voice and could point and laugh, we would never hear the end of it, except we are HARMING THEM in all these processes.

Paying attention to your skin, hair, and teeth will certainly be appreciated by those around you on a particular backpacking or camping expedition. Whether you’re camping, hiking, fishing, or backpacking, the normal rules of hygiene still apply. Here’s how to keep practicing great hygiene while you’re out and about in among the outdoors. Flickr Creative Common License: Archigeek\nDry socks are very valuable when venturing throughout the outdoors. A dry, clean pair of socks is so easy to find normally but not when you’re miles from your sock drawer. Throw a few more pairs of socks in your sack before heading out. Regardless of your activity or destination, you’ll be moving a lot and on your feet a majority of the time. Wet, dirty socks attract bacteria, which leads to a host of foot issues that can last well beyond the excursion. You can hang a pair on the outside of your pack as to quicken the drying process in emergency situations. Take along a small bottle of hand sanitizer, using it frequently after touching trees, plants, and going in lakes. You will be using your hands to cook food, clean equipment, and eat. Therefore, you’ll lessen the likelihood of ingesting and coming in contact with bacteria if you make it a habit to clean your hands with the sanitizer. It’s an easy way to avoid sickness, which would be unfortunate, especially while on the trip. You won’t be able to take a shower but that doesn’t mean you won’t be able to keep yourself clean. Take along a package of baby wipes to use to clean your entire body. You’ll be pleasantly surprised to find how refreshed and cleaner you’ll feel after wiping yourself down. Nothing can replace a nice, hot shower but baby wipes do well to remove dirt and bacteria from your body parts. You can achieve the same effect with a bottle of alcohol and cotton balls but it’s easier to use the wipes. You don’t want to neglect your mouth and teeth because you’re away from your bathroom sink. Regardless of your location, it’s still important to brush, floss, and gargle with mouthwash. Place the dental essentials in your backpack. Be mindful of when spitting out your mouthwash and toothpaste. You don’t want it running into a natural body of water. Also, the smell can attract wild animals so dispose of your mouthfuls a distance away from the camp. Read on the topic further if you decide to choose dental powder rather than paste. Those with long hair may want to braid or keep it up or back with a hair tie. Those who are going to be out in the wilderness for a while may want to cover oily hair with a headband. Also, running baby powder through the hair will help with soaking up some of the excess oil. You could bring a travel-size bottle of shampoo and quickly wash your hair out with the help of a bottle of water. It’s necessary to know of the things you can go without in addition to minding the things you’ll need. For example, you don’t need to wear deodorant; in fact, it’s suggested to leave it at home because the scent will help attract bugs and wild animals. The same goes for perfumes and cologne. There is no need for it in the wilderness and it can work against you. Of course, you don’t want to smell dirty; that’s why you’ll keep your armpits clean with baby wipes and a bit of powder. You’ll get used to the ‘natural’ smell of your skin after a day or two. The weight of your backpack and the number of needed items is always a concern to those who are hiking and camping. You’ll want to balance packing too many clothes with knowing when to change and clean what you do bring. Replace sweaty shirts and pants each night with fresh clothing. It’s best to change before going to sleep for the night. Sleeping in dirty clothes makes your sleeping bag smell and it also introduces the opportunity for rashes and skin problems. Of course, you’ll want to consider the type of material. Some materials wick away sweat while feeling light on the skin. Cotton will make a sweaty shirt stick to your skin and does not feel comfortable in the rain.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:6722777b-831e-48bf-b69d-b386bd34fcfb>"]},{"passage":"Need an argumentative essay on Personal hygiene.

{"id":7,"doc_id":"<urn:uuid:342a6bd4-f513-4985-ac71-95113bf5a3e7>","text":"We seem to be seeing a surge in new group development lately. Many of the groups coming together are activist groups focused on political, civil rights, or social justice agendas. Other groups bring members together around special interests, or are more supportive in nature. Whatever the purpose of your group effort, I thought it might be timely to talk about the process of forming a group.\nWhile you may have thought that setting up a new group is a simple process, it might prove a bit more complicated than you thought. Group development generally involves more than just getting a group of people into the same room. All groups go through fairly predictable stages, though, so understanding those stages is a good place to start and will help you understand the process as it unfolds.\nThe popular model of group development stages created by Bruce Tuckman (1965) outlines four stages in the life of a group: 1) forming, 2) storming, 3) norming, and 4) performing. Some later permutations of this model also include a fifth stage, called alternatively “adjourning” or “mourning.” I’ll talk about each stage and the challenges that can arise, but first I think it’s important to consider what exactly you hope to accomplish with your group, and to do a little bit of preparation.\nThe first question you’ll need to answer is what it is you hope to accomplish with your group. What is your purpose? Do you have a specific project or task that needs to be completed, or a particular goal in mind? Is it intended to be a loosely organized but supportive group for members sharing a problem or concern, or does it need to be laser focused on getting a job done by deadline?\nSecondly, think about who you want to have as members. If you have a specific task to accomplish, what skills will be required, and who has the needed skills? If you are hoping to address a social problem, who else might be interested in working with you? If the group will be more supportive in nature, what is the population you want to bring into the fold?\nAlso, consider what might be the optimal size for your group. For most task-oriented groups, 6 – 12 is a workable number. Smaller groups can be effective as well, however if you have only 3 – 4 members, absences can render your group temporarily ineffective. Larger groups can also work, however they tend to require more formal organization and leadership, and it may be more difficult to harness individual creativity and foster group cohesion in a larger group. Larger groups are also more prone to forming unintended subgroups, which can promote conflict, so consider whether you really need or want a large group for your project. Bigger is not necessarily better.\nOnce you have an appropriately sized group of the right people devoted to a common cause or purpose, you are ready to begin. Set up your meeting time and place, and get to work!\nThe forming stage is the first stage of group development. This stage encompasses the first and possibly several early meetings, as group members get to know each other, exchange information and ideas, and make early decisions about how they will proceed. Usually everyone is on their best behavior at the beginning. Members are checking each other out, forming opinions about the nature of the group and what their place in it may be, and trying to make a good first impression. Early group meetings tend to be cordial and to run fairly smoothly. The important work at this stage consists of forming early relationships, delineating why you are there, and deciding how you will move forward as a group. While this stage may be pleasant, you don’t want to stay here indefinitely. If a group stalls here, it may be a signal that members don’t feel comfortable, or that there is conflict brewing that is not coming out into the open. It may also indicate that members are not strongly attached to the group’s purpose.\nThe second stage of group development–storming–involves conflict. It is at this stage that disagreements and personality conflicts start to appear, and competition for control of certain group functions arises. If you have done a good job of selecting your group members, their common purpose will help them get past this stage and move on to productive work. If not, the conflict may be more protracted. During this stage the group needs to learn how to manage their differences and cooperate towards common goals. Problems can develop if there is serious disagreement around the group’s purpose, if power struggles go unresolved, or if a single bully or a powerful subgroup sets out to impose their will on others. It is generally preferable to work through conflicts rather than ignoring or submerging them, as unresolved issues may continue to undermine the group efforts going forward.\nSome group members may believe that conflict at this stage indicates something is wrong, but it is a normal stage in group development. The important thing is that conflicts are resolved constructively.\nThe the third stage of group development is called norming. This is when the group begins to develop their way of doing things. They settle issues around what is expected of group members, who will do what, how decisions will be made, and how differences will be managed. The group may develop formal rules, but they certainly will develop informal rules, or procedures that everybody knows are there even though they may not be openly acknowledged. Groups emerging from this stage are ready to settle down to work, and their members have a pretty good idea what is expected of them. They have also learned a few things about how to work with each other successfully. Sometimes unresolved conflicts from the storming stage re-emerge, and the group is temporarily thrust back into storming until they are resolved.\nThe performing stage, the fourth stage of group development, is when most of the productive work gets done. This can be brief in a temporary group formed around specific tasks, or it can go on for a lengthy period of time. A highly productive group in which there remains agreement around purpose, and in which members are committed to working together towards their mutual goals can perform well for years. There will be challenges as old members are lost, new ones are brought into the group, and occasional conflicts are resolved. There may also be new challenges when norms require updating, however a committed group may resolve them and continue to thrive. It may seem that the group must occasionally revisit an earlier stage, but it then returns to productivity. The performing stage is the reason we form groups to begin with. It is important to note, however, that it is only one stage. It is unrealistic to expect your group to perform optimally without ever going through the other stages.\nAdjourning or Mourning\nAt some point every group comes to an end. It may be that their goals have been met and their mission accomplished. It may be that things have changed and the group no longer perceives a need to continue, or that continued performance would depend on making changes that the group members are unwilling to make. Sometimes the group makes a conscious choice to dissolve. Other times a group may just fade and become inactive over time. In some cases, the group may be dissolved involuntarily due to adverse circumstances. Regardless of how a group reaches its ending point, there may be a certain sense of loss or a period of mourning for group members. Eventually they will go their separate ways and move on to other projects. Ideally, efforts will be made to end in a positive manner, and to help group members feel good about what they have accomplished together.\nImportant Note: This blog is intended for informational and discussion purposes only, and does not substitute for professional care.

While smaller groups can be effective, having only 3-4 members can make the group temporarily ineffective when members are absent. Larger groups can also work but require more formal organization and leadership, and may face challenges with individual creativity, group cohesion, and the formation of unintended subgroups that can promote conflict.","answer":"The optimal size for most task-oriented groups can vary depending on the nature of the task, the group's objectives, and the dynamics among its members. However, many studies and experts suggest that groups between 6 and 12 members can be quite effective for task-oriented work. This size is often considered a balance between having enough diversity and expertise to tackle complex tasks and maintaining effective communication and collaboration among members.\n\nA group that's too small might lack the necessary skills or perspectives to address a problem effectively, while a group that's too large can suffer from coordination issues, communication breakdowns, and difficulties in reaching consensus.\n\nHere are a few factors that influence the optimal size of a task-oriented group:\n\n1. **Task Complexity**: More complex tasks may require a larger group to bring together a wider range of skills and knowledge.\n\n2. **Communication**: As group size increases, the potential for miscommunication and coordination problems also grows. Groups larger than 12 members often struggle with maintaining clear and efficient communication.\n\n3. **Decision Making**: Larger groups can take longer to reach decisions due to the need for consensus or majority vote. Smaller groups may make decisions more quickly but risk overlooking important perspectives.\n\n4. **Group Dynamics**: The personalities and working styles of group members can greatly affect the group's effectiveness. Groups with compatible dynamics can be more productive and cohesive, regardless of size.\n\n5. **Goals and Objectives**: Groups with clear, well-defined goals may function effectively at various sizes, as long as members understand their roles and responsibilities.\n\n6. **External Factors**: Resources, time constraints, and the availability of members can also influence the optimal group size.\n\nIn summary, while the range of 6 to 12 members is often cited as ideal for task-oriented groups, the \"optimal\" size can vary based on the specific context and needs of the group.

Let me know on Twitter!\n\nSooner or later you will find the right solution for your particular situation. The important thing is that the teams are comfortable and don t stumble over each other too often. Optimal team size Most books I ve read claim that the optimal team size is somewhere around 5 9 people. From what I ve seen so far I can only agree. Although I d say 3 8 people. In fact, I believe it is worth taking some pains to achieve teams of that size. Let s say you have a single Scrum team of 10 people. Consider ejecting the two weakest team members. Oops, did I just say that? Let s say you have two different products, with one 3-person team per product, and both are moving too slow. It might be a good idea to combine them into one single 6-person team responsible for both products. In that case let one of the two product owners go (or give him an advisory role or something). 112 102 SCRUM AND XP FROM THE TRENCHES Let s say you have a single 12-person Scrum team, because the code base is in such a crappy state that there is no way for 2 different teams to work on it independently. Put some serious effort into fixing the code base (instead of building new features) until you get to a point where you can split the team. This investment will probably pay off quite quickly. Synchronized sprints or not? Let s say you have three Scrum teams working on the same product. Should their sprints be synchronized, i.e. start and end together? Or should they overlap? Our first approach was to have overlapping sprints (with respect to time). This sounded nice. At any given moment in time there would be an ongoing sprint just about to end and a new sprint just about to begin. The product owner s workload would be evenly spread out over time. There would be releases flowing continuously out of the system. Demos every week. Hallelujah. Yeah, I know, but it really did sound convincing at the time! We had just started doing this when I one day had the opportunity to talk to Ken Schwaber (in conjunction with my Scrum certification). He pointed out that this was a bad idea, that it would be much better to\n113 HOW WE HANDLE MULTIPLE SCRUM TEAMS 103 synchronize the sprints. I don t remember his exact reasons, but after some discussion I was convinced. This is the solution we ve used ever since, and never regretted it. I ll never know if the overlapping sprints strategy would have failed, but I think so. The advantage of synchronized sprints is: There is a natural time at which to rearrange teams between sprints! With overlapping sprints, there is no way to rearrange teams without disturbing at least one team in mid-sprint. All teams could work towards the same goal in a sprint and do sprint planning meetings together, which leads to better collaboration between teams. Less administrative overhead, i.e. fewer sprint planning meetings, sprint demos, and releases. Why we introduced a team lead role Let s say we have a single product with three teams. The red guy labeled P is Product Owner. The black guys labeled S are Scrum Masters. The rest are grunts... er... respectable team members. With this constellation, who decides which people should be in which teams? The product owner? The three Scrum masters together? Or does every person get to select his own team? But then what if everyone wants to be in team 1 (because Scrum master 1 is so good looking)? 114 104 SCRUM AND XP FROM THE TRENCHES What if it later turns out that it is really not possible to have more than two teams working in parallel on this code base, so we need to transform this into two 9-person teams instead of three 6-person teams. That means 2 Scrum masters. So which one of the current 3 Scrum masters will be relieved of his title? In many companies these will be quite sensitive issues. It is tempting to let the product owner do the allocation and reassignment of people. But that isn t really product owner stuff right? The product owner is the domain expert who tells the team in which direction they should run. He should not really have to get involved in the nitty gritty details. Especially since he is a chicken (if you ve heard the chicken and pig metaphor, otherwise google up chickens and pigs ). We ve solved this by introducing a team lead role. This corresponds to what you might call Scrum of Scrums master or the boss or main Scrum master etc.\n\nTime and time again people ask me this same question - how can you guesstimate the size of a project. Here is the first thing I always do - use the \"Tao\" method (also known as the \"snowflake\" or \"Fractal\" method) - please note I'm keeping the below simple and a bit naive! - you need way more to build such a complex product:\nSay I want to build a massive multiplayer online game. This is general statement of the end product we'll call level one. What do I need to realize this? High level items only - the list shouldn't be longer than 5 or so items, otherwise you know you've started on details. Lets say I split level one into the following: a) I need a dev team, b) a bunch of servers, and c) someone to take care of the servers. Keep level 2 very basic (although maybe not this basic). Now level 3 is to split each item in level 2 further into detail. For the dev team I need i) leadership ii) programmers iii) graphics guys iv) sound guys and finally v) story and level designers. For the servers I need i) web servers ii) database servers iii) backup servers iv) test server. (...and so on for level 2). Now I continue onto level 3, going into even more detail, but still keeping it pretty rough. Example using the programmers item from level 2: I need network programmers, database programmers, 3d graphic programmers, general game engine programmers, sound programmers, and possibly tool programmers (the guys who build the level editors, etc). And I do that detailing for each item in level 2. Then I start off on level 4, detailing each item in level 3 a bit further...\nAnd then level 5... etc. Once you have a level of detail that you feel is trivial enough (for our complex example you probably hit at the very least detail level 10), you can start putting time and money estimates to each item. The total of which will give you a pretty good idea of what you are in for... Note: Even a simple web app will have 5 to 7 levels of detail iteration. Sadly there isn't really an off the shelf product that you can use for this that is easy to use - I've used everything from Excel (easy enough to use) to MS Project (bonus: you already have the start of your WBS). And please don't think you need to do all the detailing yourself (unless you are a one man team!) - get subject matter experts to help you out with the sections you know they have experience in! Hope the above makes sense!\n\nDisclaimer: This article was intentionally written for an audience that do not know or care about the terminology of many of the agile methods. If you are a hard-core agilist, please look away. Let’s say you have a group of people that want to try agile, but you are not sure where to start. If you have been working without any real method before, then Scrum might seem a bit heavy-handed, and Kanban scares you off with rules and an unfamiliar terminology you do not quite understand. This is how you (might) do it. - Start off by taking any large piece of the wall (or a whiteboard), and create three columns: to-do, doing, done. Take all your current and upcoming tasks from all your group members and put them down on post-it notes. You don’t have to write an essay on every note, just enough to make it clear what each note represent. Put them up in the appropriate column. - Explain that each member of the group is responsible for updating their own notes, moving them along the board, and putting up new ones as new tasks appear. - Make an agreement with the group that they meet every other week for two hours and discuss how to improve the process. Really, the only necessary and mandatory step is 3), the other ones are just there as a conversation starter. Depending on your group size, the two hours might look different. The important thing is that you have a meaningful discussion, and that you walk away from the meeting with at least one action, change, or experiment that you want to try for the upcoming two weeks. Issues and experiments that might solve them\nI cannot tell you what issues you might run into – that will be different from every group – but here are a number of issues that might come up and experiments that you could try to solve them:\n”I cannot work on my tasks, because x is on vacation”. Working in a group, or a team, requires each task to be the responsibility of the team, not a single individual. Try collaborating more, making sure that every task can potentially be done by at least two different people in the team (who do not go on vacation at the same time). ”It is unclear what ’done’ means”. Book a meeting where the team decides on what done means for different tasks. Create a short definition and put it up next to the board so that everybody can see it. ”Our to-do column is overflowing”. Only put up tasks that you are planning on doing for the next two weeks (or whatever time span seems reasonable) in the to-do column. All other tasks can be in a longer list in a spread sheet or on a physical to-do-list. ”I do not know in which order I should be doing my tasks”. You probably need to have someone help you prioritize your tasks. Who this person is, depends on your business. Preferably, it should be someone from the receiving end of whatever your produce. ”My tasks are too big, and just get stuck in the ’doing’ column forever”. You probably need to break down your large task into smaller ones. It is a good idea to do so before the task end up on the to-do-column, but not too early either – the prioritization might change. Gathering the team to discuss upcoming tasks regularly will help. ”My tasks have a good size, but they still seem to get stuck in the ’doing’ column”. You are doing too many things at once. Try to prioritize and get one task finished before starting a new one. You could try to set a reasonable limit on the number of notes in the ’doing’ column. This means that instead of just choosing a new task when you get stuck with the current one, you must ask for help in order to get it to ’done’. ”I do not know what others are working on”. Perhaps a short meeting everyday can help? Focus on this meeting is to update everybody, but also to be able to ask for and offer help to the other group members. ”I can see that a lot of tasks are in ’doing’ column, but not who is responsible”. Simple: if you are responsible for a task, write your name the note. ”What we are doing are being questioned by outside stakeholders”. Set up a meeting, perhaps every two weeks, where you show what you have done, are doing and why. ”There are too many external disturbances”. Explain to the outside world that you are now a team, with a prioritized workflow.\n\nFor now, we need to talk about some basic patterns for scaling agile projects. To talk about how we are going to scale, we need to talk about how we are going to organize. We’ll pull it all back together in a post or two. Agile software development is all about small teams. So… what is the ideal agile team size? As far as I am concerned there is no hard rule, but most folks I talk with recommend somewhere between six to eight people. Smaller is okay… larger, not so good. There are just limits to how well more than six to eight people can really communicate with each other. So what happens when you have a project that needs more than six to eight people? Well… you break the larger team up into several smaller teams. Makes sense, right? To me, this is where agile starts to get really interesting. When you have more than one team working on a single project, maybe even a single code base, what is the best pattern for splitting the teams? There are two primary schools of thought. Organize Around Features\nThe traditionally taught… and almost universally accepted… approach for organizing agile teams is to organize around features. For a very thorough explanation of feature teams go find the book “Scaling Lean & Agile Development” by Craig Larman and Bas Vodde. According to Larman and Vodde a feature team is a “long lived, cross-functional team that completes many end-to-end customer features, one by one”. Highsmith states in “Agile Project Management” that “Feature based delivery means that the engineering team builds [customer centric] features of the final product.” I cheated here a little and grabbed the Highsmith quote from the Larman and Vodde book also. I figured it was okay because I read the Highsmith book too ;-)\nLarman and Vodde summarize the ideal feature team as cross-functional, cross component, and co-located. They are working on complete user functionality, the team is made up of generalizing specialists, and typically six to eight people in size. In other words, our prototypical Scrum team. The authors also point out several challenges with the feature team approach…. which I really appreciated by the way. Common barriers include… concurrent access to code, shared responsibility for design, difficult to learn skills, and organizational structure. Their assertion is that with modern tooling these challenges can be overcome… but it could take years. I have to admit… this is clearly the most straightforward… and probably most effective way of organizing agile teams… but it makes some assumptions about your teams and your engineering practices. Like all assumptions, these need to validated. For a complete treatment of the feature team concept, go find the book… it is a good read. Organize Around the Architecture\nA more controversial approach to scaling agile teams can be found in Leffingwell’s book “Scaling Software Agility”. Leffingwell introduces the idea of a design\/build\/test component team. The component team shares many of the same attributes of the feature team in that it is small and contains all the skill-sets necessary to delivery the user story. Leffingwell’s component team is empowered, self-organized, and self-managing. In short, they are a typical Scrum team. But… and this is a big but… they are working on component features… not end user features. This is really the exact opposite of what is recommended by Larman and Vodde. A feature team would be made up of specializing generalists from each of the component teams. These specializing generalists would have collective responsibility for delivering the customer centric feature end to end. Not quite the same as a component team, huh? I told you this was going to get interesting. Where Leffingwell is going… is that at some level of scale… on some projects (let your imagination run wild here)… the system WILL get big enough that a single Scrum team cannot contain enough specializing generalists to cover a single feature. In some systems… not all, but some… we are dealing with a systems of systems. Some organizations… some products… require a systems of system. Just to be fair… go get Leffingwell’s book too… it is also a good read. It’s a Tough Call\nSo… our first really important decision is to figure out if the feature team approach is going to work in our environment or if we need to go with component team model. Personally… I tend to start with the feature team approach and only move toward components if I have to… but the decision is very situationally specific.\n\n- Testing, reviewing, and assessing the product\n- Creating automated tests, tools, and methods to make sure systems are running according to requirements\n- Pinpointing problems and working on their solutions\nTheir role is to create the best user experience possible for their product, making it visually captivating and psychologically comfortable. - Producing user-friendly design, user flows, wireframes, prototypes, and mockups\n- Catching and troubleshooting UX problems\nDevelopment and operations engineers automate the application life cycle (including design, development, testing, deployment, support, and monitoring). Basically, it’s merging the skills of software developers, testers, system administrators, and IT managers into one specialist. DevOps reduce software development time and help you implement new features in your product on the go. But their presence is optional, depending on the scope of your project. - Applying processes and methodologies to streamline product development\n- Managing the application infrastructure\nThis expert ensures that the development team and stakeholders are on the same page. They translate business goals into clear development tasks to match the final product with its business value. Smaller software development projects don’t require a BA. - Clarifying the business idea\n- Planning development activities\n- Standardizing the software development process\n- Validating requirements\nSoftware Development Team Size\nTo determine the team size, you have to consider project complexity, its platform, schedule, budget constraints, and the type of project management approach. Keep in mind that there is no ideal number. Smaller teams mean smoother coordination, but you can’t afford to lose anyone from the team. Members of a big team are easier to substitute, but managing the communication might be a challenge. As mentioned above, some software development experts like business analysts or DevOps are not a must for a team. But if your project is large-scale, it will be hard to complete it without them. At some point, you might require specific consultants if such a need arises. Also, if you don’t consider yourself an IT genius, consider hiring a CTO (Chief Technology Officer). This person will supervise matters related to the tech stack. Software development team size can also be dependent on how much time you have. Usually, the tighter the deadline, the more professionals you have to bring in. Sometimes, the team size can also be affected by the software you plan to make. If you want to build a mobile app development team, the basic number of specialists required is five or six (e.g., a project\/product manager, UI\/UX designer, IOS\/Android developer, back-end developer, and quality assurance engineer). If you’re after a desktop app, then your team will be larger. You’ll need extra specialists who know how to work with different popular operating systems (Mac OS X, Windows, Unix, and Unix-like systems like Linux, Ubuntu, and FreeBSD). And for web development, such professionals as web developers and solution architects are needed. Project Management Approaches\nThere are two common management styles: Waterfall and Agile. A Waterfall team is built on a strict hierarchy with well-defined team roles for each member. An Agile team is self-organized and self-managed; it employs cross-functional talent instead of roles set in stone. There is no limit to team size for the first style. But those who adhere to agile methodology believe that the optimal team size is between three and nine members. And seven members is considered to be the perfect fit. You might have figured out the team size you need at this point. But you understand that your budget won’t cover the expenses. In this case, you’d better save money on the employment model instead of hiring fewer specialists than the project requires. We’re going to talk about these models later in this article. Software Development Team Roles and Stages\nThere are five main stages of software development: (1) analysis, (2) design, (3) development, (4) testing, and (5) implementation & maintenance. Each stage involves specific team members. Here, you have to identify the problem that your software must solve. This stage sets the foundation for the whole project’s direction. It also makes sure that the client’s business goals will align with the final product. Team members involved:\n- Business Analyst\n- Product Manager\nNow, it’s time to build the architecture of the project by creating the SRS document. It describes all the features and performance expected from the software.\n\nOne of the firmest bits of advice I've heard from people who do large projects (anything over 50 people) is that the project should start small, maybe with just a dozen or so developers. They should figure out the key design elements and interactions of the system by building early parts of it. Only once that design has settled down should you think of increasing the team size to its full size. As part of that settling down put time into removing any design elements that you don't think should be copied. People will naturally copy stuff that's already there, so you should ensure that what's there is all going to make a good platform for further development. This is a time to err on the side of excessive attention to code-cleanliness. Finally, when thinking of ramping up, think very carefully about whether it's worth it. I've rarely come across a large team where there isn't a feeling that the team could be significantly cut without reducing its productivity. As I once said \"scaling agile is the last thing you want to do\". My colleague Francisco Trindade talks about a good experience he used for bringing on a few developers at once over a couple of weeks. 1: This couple-of-weeks rule is for ThoughtWorkers, so we would expect it would take longer for people who don't match our hiring standards.\n\nExtract solutions that could potentially address the identified problem(s)\nWe do this activity so that the entire team -— product managers, designers, and engineers -— is able to document their ideas and contribute to the overall solution, enhancing our shared responsibility for the success of the product. After all, no single discipline has a monopoly on good ideas! Solution Brainstorming is often one of the first times that we begin to explore solutions and features. We run this activity after identifying and prioritizing insights & problems because we want to solve for the most important things first. Stick each problem or Insight to its own large sheet of paper, such as a sheet of tabloid (11\"x17\") \/ A3 paper, or section of the digital workspace. Distribute or assign a sheet with problems or insights attached to each team member. Have team members convert their assigned problem or insight into a “How might we…?” statement, writing the output clearly on a new, differently colored large sticky note and attaching it over the original problem or insight. Go around the group and have each person (or pair) share out their original problem or insight and the “How might we…?” statement(s) they created from it. Make adjustments as a team until you’re happy with all statements. Ensuring each person has a sheet or digital whiteboard section, set a timer for 3-4 minutes during which everyone quietly brainstorms ideas that could potentially solve the “How might we…?” statement. These can be as simple or fanciful as you like. After the time is up, have everyone pass the sheet(s) to the person next to them (or create an order if remote) and repeat Step 5. After the brainstorms make their way around the group and back to the person they started with, you’ll have generated a slew of ideas. Success is achieved when you have extracted ideas that directly relate to your top problems and insights and captured them for further refinement. You may need to adjust the timing depending on how many people are present. Be sure to give sufficient time for people to both read ideas and create new ideas (this is especially critical as you get further into the pass-and-brainstorm process).\n\nAt OOPSLA '96 two different types of designers came together to test their OO skills. The first set of designers came prepared with the problem statement known to them prior to attending the Design Fest Workshop. The second set of designers only knew the category to which they would be designing (e.g., Automation). Another experiment was made this year that was not attempted last year. Some of the design groups met for a full day on Sunday, October 6, 1996 to work on the problem. The remaining design teams met only for a half day on Tuesday, October 8, 1996 to work on the same problems the first team had. Assisting each small design team were the problem author, a moderator, and a recorder. This page reports the results for the only design team working on the Automation problem. The team met for the half day session and had no advance knowledge of the problem. We worked on the Factory Automation problem. The team took about 15 minutes to first define a development process that would aid in budgeting the already short design time. * There were iterative cycles used between steps 3 and 4\nThe team spent about an hour reading the requirements document and asking questions to the customer to clarify any unclear or open issues about the problem statement. As an artifact from this task the team diagramed the physical layout of a typical production cell described by the problem statement. This diagram is shown below:\nThe team then proceeded to identify the participants in the problem domain and identify the static relationships with each. We first created a sheet for every major player and identified each of the attributes corresponding to that player. We later transferred this knowledged to the static diagram shown below. The time taken to create a draft of the static and dynamic diagrams took about 1.5 hours. Concurrently with the static analysis\/design, the team began to document the flow of the use cases found within the requirements document. Once we had a clear enough static model to move on, the team broke up into two smaller sub-teams that each tackled a different use case. The following diagram represents the information found for the first use case. There are also two exception cases described on this same diagram. The interaction diagram showing the loading of a machine from a parts bin is depicted in the diagram shown below. The sub-team working on this problem was done before the other sub-team. This sub-team moved on to the Documentation Manufacturing 10 minutes early. Once we completed the draft diagrams we were comfortable with we created new diagrams that would be used for the poster session. The time spent was about 15 minutes. The remaining time the team had was spent on analyzing the experience and recording our comments for others to share in our experience. The next major section describes what we found. As the moderator, I was charged with the task of guiding the group in the process, but definitely not in the content of the design. My role was to help them stay focused and to keep the team from wasting time down side tracks or arguments. I accomplished my role by using the process to define milestones where the team was to be at specific times. I then kept reminding them how much time was left for particular tasks. My team was a great team and worked well with each other. This was the first time any of them met. This made for some interesting team dynamics. I found people to be more polite in this team than in other teams I have been a part of. I also found this team more willing to compromise when necessary. Let me illustrate. The database became a problem entity that was getting out of control very quickly. There were team members that felt the information should be distributed throughout the various pieces of equipment that were responsible for the information. Others felt that the Cell control computer needed to have a centralized repository for the information due to time constraints in requesting the information. I had to step in and summarize what I was hearing as two different design philosophies - distributed vs. centralized information. Once the team was aware of what they were talking about, one of the members realized that they could abstract out the interface for obtaining the information and continue without having to resolve the differences immediately.

What should I do?\" The questioner should avoid making assumptions about the best way to solve the problem, and focus on describing the goals, requirements, and constraints. In other words, the questioner should avoid making assumptions about what form the solution will take, and the questioner should be specific enough to provide all relevant information. Deviating from these guidelines tends to lead to lower-quality questions. For example, if the questioner assumes that the solution will take a particular form, he might be tempted to ask a question whether there exists any scheme of that particular form; those kinds of existence questions should be discouraged. On the other hand, if the question is \"Does there exist a cryptographic scheme that meets security notion X? \", that kind of question might be on-topic if it seems likely to be of interest to our community. The answer might be yes (with an example of such a scheme), or it might be no (with a proof that it cannot be done). Unfortunately, it looks like the sort of questions we're getting so far don't really look like the sort of questions we'd want to encourage more of.

The important thing is that the teams are comfortable and don t stumble over each other too often. Optimal team size Most books I ve read claim that the optimal team size is somewhere around 5 9 people. From what I ve seen so far I can only agree. Although I d say 3 8 people. In fact, I believe it is worth taking some pains to achieve teams of that size. Let s say you have a single Scrum team of 10 people. Consider ejecting the two weakest team members. Oops, did I just say that? Let s say you have two different products, with one 3-person team per product, and both are moving too slow. It might be a good idea to combine them into one single 6-person team responsible for both products. In that case let one of the two product owners go (or give him an advisory role or something). 112 102 SCRUM AND XP FROM THE TRENCHES Let s say you have a single 12-person Scrum team, because the code base is in such a crappy state that there is no way for 2 different teams to work on it independently. Put some serious effort into fixing the code base (instead of building new features) until you get to a point where you can split the team. This investment will probably pay off quite quickly. Synchronized sprints or not? Let s say you have three Scrum teams working on the same product. Should their sprints be synchronized, i.e. start and end together? Or should they overlap? Our first approach was to have overlapping sprints (with respect to time). This sounded nice. At any given moment in time there would be an ongoing sprint just about to end and a new sprint just about to begin. The product owner s workload would be evenly spread out over time. There would be releases flowing continuously out of the system. Demos every week. Hallelujah. Yeah, I know, but it really did sound convincing at the time! We had just started doing this when I one day had the opportunity to talk to Ken Schwaber (in conjunction with my Scrum certification). He pointed out that this was a bad idea, that it would be much better to\n113 HOW WE HANDLE MULTIPLE SCRUM TEAMS 103 synchronize the sprints. I don t remember his exact reasons, but after some discussion I was convinced. This is the solution we ve used ever since, and never regretted it. I ll never know if the overlapping sprints strategy would have failed, but I think so. The advantage of synchronized sprints is: There is a natural time at which to rearrange teams between sprints! With overlapping sprints, there is no way to rearrange teams without disturbing at least one team in mid-sprint. All teams could work towards the same goal in a sprint and do sprint planning meetings together, which leads to better collaboration between teams. Less administrative overhead, i.e. fewer sprint planning meetings, sprint demos, and releases. Why we introduced a team lead role Let s say we have a single product with three teams. The red guy labeled P is Product Owner. The black guys labeled S are Scrum Masters. The rest are grunts... er... respectable team members. With this constellation, who decides which people should be in which teams? The product owner? The three Scrum masters together? Or does every person get to select his own team? But then what if everyone wants to be in team 1 (because Scrum master 1 is so good looking)? 114 104 SCRUM AND XP FROM THE TRENCHES What if it later turns out that it is really not possible to have more than two teams working in parallel on this code base, so we need to transform this into two 9-person teams instead of three 6-person teams. That means 2 Scrum masters. So which one of the current 3 Scrum masters will be relieved of his title? In many companies these will be quite sensitive issues. It is tempting to let the product owner do the allocation and reassignment of people. But that isn t really product owner stuff right? The product owner is the domain expert who tells the team in which direction they should run. He should not really have to get involved in the nitty gritty details. Especially since he is a chicken (if you ve heard the chicken and pig metaphor, otherwise google up chickens and pigs ). We ve solved this by introducing a team lead role.

Here is the first thing I always do - use the \"Tao\" method (also known as the \"snowflake\" or \"Fractal\" method) - please note I'm keeping the below simple and a bit naive! - you need way more to build such a complex product:\nSay I want to build a massive multiplayer online game. This is general statement of the end product we'll call level one. What do I need to realize this? High level items only - the list shouldn't be longer than 5 or so items, otherwise you know you've started on details. Lets say I split level one into the following: a) I need a dev team, b) a bunch of servers, and c) someone to take care of the servers. Keep level 2 very basic (although maybe not this basic). Now level 3 is to split each item in level 2 further into detail. For the dev team I need i) leadership ii) programmers iii) graphics guys iv) sound guys and finally v) story and level designers. For the servers I need i) web servers ii) database servers iii) backup servers iv) test server. (...and so on for level 2). Now I continue onto level 3, going into even more detail, but still keeping it pretty rough. Example using the programmers item from level 2: I need network programmers, database programmers, 3d graphic programmers, general game engine programmers, sound programmers, and possibly tool programmers (the guys who build the level editors, etc). And I do that detailing for each item in level 2. Then I start off on level 4, detailing each item in level 3 a bit further...\nAnd then level 5... etc. Once you have a level of detail that you feel is trivial enough (for our complex example you probably hit at the very least detail level 10), you can start putting time and money estimates to each item. The total of which will give you a pretty good idea of what you are in for... Note: Even a simple web app will have 5 to 7 levels of detail iteration. Sadly there isn't really an off the shelf product that you can use for this that is easy to use - I've used everything from Excel (easy enough to use) to MS Project (bonus: you already have the start of your WBS).

If you are a hard-core agilist, please look away. Let’s say you have a group of people that want to try agile, but you are not sure where to start. If you have been working without any real method before, then Scrum might seem a bit heavy-handed, and Kanban scares you off with rules and an unfamiliar terminology you do not quite understand. This is how you (might) do it. - Start off by taking any large piece of the wall (or a whiteboard), and create three columns: to-do, doing, done. Take all your current and upcoming tasks from all your group members and put them down on post-it notes. You don’t have to write an essay on every note, just enough to make it clear what each note represent. Put them up in the appropriate column. - Explain that each member of the group is responsible for updating their own notes, moving them along the board, and putting up new ones as new tasks appear. - Make an agreement with the group that they meet every other week for two hours and discuss how to improve the process. Really, the only necessary and mandatory step is 3), the other ones are just there as a conversation starter. Depending on your group size, the two hours might look different. The important thing is that you have a meaningful discussion, and that you walk away from the meeting with at least one action, change, or experiment that you want to try for the upcoming two weeks. Issues and experiments that might solve them\nI cannot tell you what issues you might run into – that will be different from every group – but here are a number of issues that might come up and experiments that you could try to solve them:\n”I cannot work on my tasks, because x is on vacation”. Working in a group, or a team, requires each task to be the responsibility of the team, not a single individual. Try collaborating more, making sure that every task can potentially be done by at least two different people in the team (who do not go on vacation at the same time). ”It is unclear what ’done’ means”. Book a meeting where the team decides on what done means for different tasks. Create a short definition and put it up next to the board so that everybody can see it. ”Our to-do column is overflowing”. Only put up tasks that you are planning on doing for the next two weeks (or whatever time span seems reasonable) in the to-do column. All other tasks can be in a longer list in a spread sheet or on a physical to-do-list. ”I do not know in which order I should be doing my tasks”. You probably need to have someone help you prioritize your tasks. Who this person is, depends on your business. Preferably, it should be someone from the receiving end of whatever your produce. ”My tasks are too big, and just get stuck in the ’doing’ column forever”. You probably need to break down your large task into smaller ones. It is a good idea to do so before the task end up on the to-do-column, but not too early either – the prioritization might change. Gathering the team to discuss upcoming tasks regularly will help. ”My tasks have a good size, but they still seem to get stuck in the ’doing’ column”. You are doing too many things at once. Try to prioritize and get one task finished before starting a new one. You could try to set a reasonable limit on the number of notes in the ’doing’ column. This means that instead of just choosing a new task when you get stuck with the current one, you must ask for help in order to get it to ’done’. ”I do not know what others are working on”. Perhaps a short meeting everyday can help? Focus on this meeting is to update everybody, but also to be able to ask for and offer help to the other group members. ”I can see that a lot of tasks are in ’doing’ column, but not who is responsible”. Simple: if you are responsible for a task, write your name the note. ”What we are doing are being questioned by outside stakeholders”. Set up a meeting, perhaps every two weeks, where you show what you have done, are doing and why. ”There are too many external disturbances”.

To talk about how we are going to scale, we need to talk about how we are going to organize. We’ll pull it all back together in a post or two. Agile software development is all about small teams. So… what is the ideal agile team size? As far as I am concerned there is no hard rule, but most folks I talk with recommend somewhere between six to eight people. Smaller is okay… larger, not so good. There are just limits to how well more than six to eight people can really communicate with each other. So what happens when you have a project that needs more than six to eight people? Well… you break the larger team up into several smaller teams. Makes sense, right? To me, this is where agile starts to get really interesting. When you have more than one team working on a single project, maybe even a single code base, what is the best pattern for splitting the teams? There are two primary schools of thought. Organize Around Features\nThe traditionally taught… and almost universally accepted… approach for organizing agile teams is to organize around features. For a very thorough explanation of feature teams go find the book “Scaling Lean & Agile Development” by Craig Larman and Bas Vodde. According to Larman and Vodde a feature team is a “long lived, cross-functional team that completes many end-to-end customer features, one by one”. Highsmith states in “Agile Project Management” that “Feature based delivery means that the engineering team builds [customer centric] features of the final product.” I cheated here a little and grabbed the Highsmith quote from the Larman and Vodde book also. I figured it was okay because I read the Highsmith book too ;-)\nLarman and Vodde summarize the ideal feature team as cross-functional, cross component, and co-located. They are working on complete user functionality, the team is made up of generalizing specialists, and typically six to eight people in size. In other words, our prototypical Scrum team. The authors also point out several challenges with the feature team approach…. which I really appreciated by the way. Common barriers include… concurrent access to code, shared responsibility for design, difficult to learn skills, and organizational structure. Their assertion is that with modern tooling these challenges can be overcome… but it could take years. I have to admit… this is clearly the most straightforward… and probably most effective way of organizing agile teams… but it makes some assumptions about your teams and your engineering practices. Like all assumptions, these need to validated. For a complete treatment of the feature team concept, go find the book… it is a good read. Organize Around the Architecture\nA more controversial approach to scaling agile teams can be found in Leffingwell’s book “Scaling Software Agility”. Leffingwell introduces the idea of a design\/build\/test component team. The component team shares many of the same attributes of the feature team in that it is small and contains all the skill-sets necessary to delivery the user story. Leffingwell’s component team is empowered, self-organized, and self-managing. In short, they are a typical Scrum team. But… and this is a big but… they are working on component features… not end user features. This is really the exact opposite of what is recommended by Larman and Vodde. A feature team would be made up of specializing generalists from each of the component teams. These specializing generalists would have collective responsibility for delivering the customer centric feature end to end. Not quite the same as a component team, huh? I told you this was going to get interesting. Where Leffingwell is going… is that at some level of scale… on some projects (let your imagination run wild here)… the system WILL get big enough that a single Scrum team cannot contain enough specializing generalists to cover a single feature. In some systems… not all, but some… we are dealing with a systems of systems. Some organizations… some products… require a systems of system. Just to be fair… go get Leffingwell’s book too… it is also a good read. It’s a Tough Call\nSo… our first really important decision is to figure out if the feature team approach is going to work in our environment or if we need to go with component team model. Personally… I tend to start with the feature team approach and only move toward components if I have to… but the decision is very situationally specific.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:be26dd67-3d10-4248-8bb6-0aee82e61857>"]},{"passage":"- Testing, reviewing, and assessing the product\n- Creating automated tests, tools, and methods to make sure systems are running according to requirements\n- Pinpointing problems and working on their solutions\nTheir role is to create the best user experience possible for their product, making it visually captivating and psychologically comfortable. - Producing user-friendly design, user flows, wireframes, prototypes, and mockups\n- Catching and troubleshooting UX problems\nDevelopment and operations engineers automate the application life cycle (including design, development, testing, deployment, support, and monitoring). Basically, it’s merging the skills of software developers, testers, system administrators, and IT managers into one specialist.

But their presence is optional, depending on the scope of your project. - Applying processes and methodologies to streamline product development\n- Managing the application infrastructure\nThis expert ensures that the development team and stakeholders are on the same page.

Smaller software development projects don’t require a BA. - Clarifying the business idea\n- Planning development activities\n- Standardizing the software development process\n- Validating requirements\nSoftware Development Team Size\nTo determine the team size, you have to consider project complexity, its platform, schedule, budget constraints, and the type of project management approach. Keep in mind that there is no ideal number. Smaller teams mean smoother coordination, but you can’t afford to lose anyone from the team. Members of a big team are easier to substitute, but managing the communication might be a challenge. As mentioned above, some software development experts like business analysts or DevOps are not a must for a team. But if your project is large-scale, it will be hard to complete it without them. At some point, you might require specific consultants if such a need arises. Also, if you don’t consider yourself an IT genius, consider hiring a CTO (Chief Technology Officer). This person will supervise matters related to the tech stack. Software development team size can also be dependent on how much time you have. Usually, the tighter the deadline, the more professionals you have to bring in. Sometimes, the team size can also be affected by the software you plan to make. If you want to build a mobile app development team, the basic number of specialists required is five or six (e.g., a project\/product manager, UI\/UX designer, IOS\/Android developer, back-end developer, and quality assurance engineer). If you’re after a desktop app, then your team will be larger. You’ll need extra specialists who know how to work with different popular operating systems (Mac OS X, Windows, Unix, and Unix-like systems like Linux, Ubuntu, and FreeBSD). And for web development, such professionals as web developers and solution architects are needed. Project Management Approaches\nThere are two common management styles: Waterfall and Agile. A Waterfall team is built on a strict hierarchy with well-defined team roles for each member. An Agile team is self-organized and self-managed; it employs cross-functional talent instead of roles set in stone. There is no limit to team size for the first style. But those who adhere to agile methodology believe that the optimal team size is between three and nine members. And seven members is considered to be the perfect fit. You might have figured out the team size you need at this point. But you understand that your budget won’t cover the expenses. In this case, you’d better save money on the employment model instead of hiring fewer specialists than the project requires. We’re going to talk about these models later in this article. Software Development Team Roles and Stages\nThere are five main stages of software development: (1) analysis, (2) design, (3) development, (4) testing, and (5) implementation & maintenance. Each stage involves specific team members. Here, you have to identify the problem that your software must solve. This stage sets the foundation for the whole project’s direction. It also makes sure that the client’s business goals will align with the final product. Team members involved:\n- Business Analyst\n- Product Manager\nNow, it’s time to build the architecture of the project by creating the SRS document. It describes all the features and performance expected from the software.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:2c4ba8e3-ca72-49a6-a414-2892af5cef5f>"]},{"passage":"One of the firmest bits of advice I've heard from people who do large projects (anything over 50 people) is that the project should start small, maybe with just a dozen or so developers. They should figure out the key design elements and interactions of the system by building early parts of it. Only once that design has settled down should you think of increasing the team size to its full size. As part of that settling down put time into removing any design elements that you don't think should be copied. People will naturally copy stuff that's already there, so you should ensure that what's there is all going to make a good platform for further development. This is a time to err on the side of excessive attention to code-cleanliness. Finally, when thinking of ramping up, think very carefully about whether it's worth it. I've rarely come across a large team where there isn't a feeling that the team could be significantly cut without reducing its productivity. As I once said \"scaling agile is the last thing you want to do\".

After all, no single discipline has a monopoly on good ideas! Solution Brainstorming is often one of the first times that we begin to explore solutions and features. We run this activity after identifying and prioritizing insights & problems because we want to solve for the most important things first. Stick each problem or Insight to its own large sheet of paper, such as a sheet of tabloid (11\"x17\") \/ A3 paper, or section of the digital workspace. Distribute or assign a sheet with problems or insights attached to each team member.

Success is achieved when you have extracted ideas that directly relate to your top problems and insights and captured them for further refinement.

The first set of designers came prepared with the problem statement known to them prior to attending the Design Fest Workshop. The second set of designers only knew the category to which they would be designing (e.g., Automation). Another experiment was made this year that was not attempted last year. Some of the design groups met for a full day on Sunday, October 6, 1996 to work on the problem. The remaining design teams met only for a half day on Tuesday, October 8, 1996 to work on the same problems the first team had. Assisting each small design team were the problem author, a moderator, and a recorder. This page reports the results for the only design team working on the Automation problem. The team met for the half day session and had no advance knowledge of the problem. We worked on the Factory Automation problem. The team took about 15 minutes to first define a development process that would aid in budgeting the already short design time. * There were iterative cycles used between steps 3 and 4\nThe team spent about an hour reading the requirements document and asking questions to the customer to clarify any unclear or open issues about the problem statement. As an artifact from this task the team diagramed the physical layout of a typical production cell described by the problem statement. This diagram is shown below:\nThe team then proceeded to identify the participants in the problem domain and identify the static relationships with each. We first created a sheet for every major player and identified each of the attributes corresponding to that player. We later transferred this knowledged to the static diagram shown below. The time taken to create a draft of the static and dynamic diagrams took about 1.5 hours. Concurrently with the static analysis\/design, the team began to document the flow of the use cases found within the requirements document. Once we had a clear enough static model to move on, the team broke up into two smaller sub-teams that each tackled a different use case. The following diagram represents the information found for the first use case. There are also two exception cases described on this same diagram. The interaction diagram showing the loading of a machine from a parts bin is depicted in the diagram shown below. The sub-team working on this problem was done before the other sub-team. This sub-team moved on to the Documentation Manufacturing 10 minutes early. Once we completed the draft diagrams we were comfortable with we created new diagrams that would be used for the poster session. The time spent was about 15 minutes. The remaining time the team had was spent on analyzing the experience and recording our comments for others to share in our experience. The next major section describes what we found. As the moderator, I was charged with the task of guiding the group in the process, but definitely not in the content of the design. My role was to help them stay focused and to keep the team from wasting time down side tracks or arguments. I accomplished my role by using the process to define milestones where the team was to be at specific times. I then kept reminding them how much time was left for particular tasks. My team was a great team and worked well with each other. This was the first time any of them met. This made for some interesting team dynamics. I found people to be more polite in this team than in other teams I have been a part of. I also found this team more willing to compromise when necessary. Let me illustrate. The database became a problem entity that was getting out of control very quickly. There were team members that felt the information should be distributed throughout the various pieces of equipment that were responsible for the information. Others felt that the Cell control computer needed to have a centralized repository for the information due to time constraints in requesting the information. I had to step in and summarize what I was hearing as two different design philosophies - distributed vs. centralized information. Once the team was aware of what they were talking about, one of the members realized that they could abstract out the interface for obtaining the information and continue without having to resolve the differences immediately. I'm not so sure this would have gone so smoothly in the real world. I believe that there was a variety of skill levels on this team.

You could purchase something that turns out to be defective or simply change your mind about the item. Regardless of the circumstances, you should be able to seek out a credit card refund from the merchant. It’s a relatively easy process that credits your account the purchase amount of the item. What is a credit card refund? When you make a purchase on a credit card then request a refund for that purchase, you won’t be able to receive cash. Instead, you’ll receive a credit on your account that is equal to the amount of the original purchase. The process usually begins after the merchant agrees to refund you for the item. If the merchant refuses to or is unable to, however, then you may be able to rely on return protection instead. Consult with your credit card issuer for information on whether your situation meets the requirements to enact the protection policy. How does a credit card refund work? To fully understand how refunds are granted to your credit card account, it’s important to know how the transactions are actually processed. When you make a purchase with a credit card, your credit card company is who pays the merchant. The available credit on your account goes down after your card issuer approves the transaction. Then, you pay them back for the purchase when you make payments to your account. Credit card networks are the companies that process the transactions between your credit card issuer and the merchants where you make purchases. So, the merchant has to send your refund back to your credit card issuer before they can credit your account for the purchase. That is why credit card refunds often take several days to process, and you can only receive a refund in the original payment method. If you are making a return in-store, the merchant can sometimes pull your card details from the receipt; otherwise, you will need to have the same card with you. As well, your card issuer may not refund any foreign transaction fees because it costs them money to process an international purchase, so consult with them to know for sure. How long does a credit card refund take? Since return transactions have to go through the credit card networks, it often takes several days to see the credit returned to your account. The exact time can vary depending on your return method, the card issuer and the merchant. If you have returned the item in person, some merchants can credit your account quickly, but generally, it will take five to 14 business days. Additionally, if the return isn’t processed by your card’s closing date, it won’t appear on that month’s statement. If you have mailed your return, you will also have to take shipping time into account. The best way to get an idea of how long a refund will take is to find more information on the merchant’s website. If you would prefer the refund to happen immediately, you can ask for store credit instead, but the purchase balance would then stay on your account. What’s the difference between a credit card refund and a chargeback? A credit card refund occurs after you make a purchase and then have the purchase amount credited back to your account. A chargeback, on the other hand, reverses the original charge and can only occur after you have filed a billing dispute with your credit card company. You may file a billing dispute within 60 days for something you didn’t purchase or something you purchased and never received. A current example may be getting a chargeback for an event that was canceled due to COVID-19. The refund process, unless you are enacting your card issuer’s return protection, is initiated by the merchant, while a chargeback is initiated by your credit card company. A chargeback can also take much longer because your card company has 90 days to resolve the issue and up to 150 days to complete the charge reverse process. Credit card refunds: FAQ\nDo credit card refunds affect your credit? A credit card refund may boost your credit score if it reduces your account’s credit utilization ratio. Using 30 percent or less of your card’s total credit limit will help avoid any negative impact on your credit score. The purchase amount of a returned item that hasn’t yet been processed and pushes your credit utilization above 30 percent may harm your score until the refund is complete.

Its where they put it now so that if you want to issue a refund for any reason you can find it. Does not mean you have to refund or that a refund has been made. Ok thanks for the info, i was a bit worried.\n\nIn simple terms, refund is a process in which a consumer ask retailer to return the money previously paid. Has this ever happened to you while making an online purchase? - You returned an item and the money was promised to be credited to your account within 5-10 working days\n- Your transaction was not completed but money was still deducted from your account\nYou would expect that the refund would reflect instantly in your account, right? Why then does it take so long? Let’s take you behind the scenes to see why payments fail, what are legitimate cases for refunds, what you should expect and do as a customer to get your refund. There are two broad instances in which a need for a refund is created. Case 1- A customer tries to complete a payment on a website but the payment shows up as failed. However, the customer is notified by his bank that money has been deducted already. How do payments fail? If the communication fails at any point after the customer account has been charged, the payment fails and the customer has a legitimate case for seeking a refund. There can be various reasons for failing but the most prominent one in our experience is network connectivity. Until all steps are complete, the customer’s device needs to be connected to the internet for the customer to be notified. Also, payments can show up as failed if the payment status is not updated either by issuing banks or the acquiring bank despite being collected. The payment gateway does not receive any notification in these cases just as the customers and the online business themselves. Payments work on several technical infrastructures and all of them are not as optimized to solve such issues. As the classic adage goes – any chain is as strong as its weakest link. This could not be more true for online payments. Case 2- The customer transacts successfully on a website for purchase of certain goods or services. But the customer requests a refund from the business when the product arrives as he realizes the disinterest or misfit in the order. What happens next? The online business now makes a refund request via their payment gateway. The payment gateway conveys this information to their acquiring bank (the bank with which they have an account) via APIs. This acquiring bank has to communicate with the issuing bank (the bank in which the customer account\/card is held) which was used for the payment and raise a refund request. Ideally, the refund request is accepted, filed and then processed by the issuing bank. On completion of this process, refunds are reflected in the customer’s account\/card balance. Why refunds take 5-10 days? There are numerous payment gateways working in the country with major acquiring banks which help process payments and various banks which allow payments via net banking or their card network. Each refund has to go through at least these three parties and flow of communication for each refund varies as per the combination of these 3 parties. At times, a refund request gets dropped in the process due to network failures. Whenever this happens, the refund may stay void until the refund request is initiated again. How does atomtech handle refunds? At atom tech, we have developed special system to monitor the online payments so that the refunds are handled without impacting the end customers. Also, we attempt to resolve issues further with the banks via manual intervention if payment\/refund is not tracked. Our limitations as a Payment Gateway\nThe refunds problem is deep and reconciliation across all payment networks is a real challenge. For a payment to be complete it has to go through several stages and hence, becomes difficult to track. Say you are transacting on a website and what you see as a customer is an Order ID. This Order ID is now communicated to a payment gateway which assigns a payment ID of its own and calls it Payment ID. The acquiring bank receives this payment ID from the payment gateway and forwards it to the issuing bank with its own term Transaction ID or yet another payment ID. You can see where this is going. The same structure repeats itself when a refund request is made and a refund ID is generated by the merchant or the payments platform. As there is no universal tracking mechanism across the system, there are gaps through which the status of payments or refunds can sometimes be temporarily lost.\n\n### Question: Are refunds always processed using the same payment method that was used for the initial purchase?","passages":[{"passage":"Refunds for purchases will be credited back to the original payment method only.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:448c0d4c-3d66-4003-b901-4527eea9ac26>"]},{"passage":"In most cases, you will be refunded in the same manner that your order was paid for.

Iowa law establishes the following penalties for boating while intoxicated. - Upon a first conviction, a person may be fined up to $1,000, jailed for at least 48 hours, and prohibited from operating a vessel for one year. - Upon a second conviction, a person may be fined up to $5,000, jailed for at least 7 days, and prohibited from operating a vessel for two years. - Upon the third and subsequent convictions, a person may be fined up to $7,500, jailed for up to one year, and prohibited from operating a vessel for six years. - In addition, persons convicted of BWI will be assigned to substance abuse evaluation\/treatment and must attend a course for drinking drivers. - Persons convicted of BWI who caused the death or injury of someone will receive severe penalties in addition to those above.\n\n*Although not affected by Kadyn's Law, it is important to remember that offenses that cause unintentional serious injury or death to another person and that are charged as operating while intoxicated (OWI), reckless driving, eluding or attempting to elude a law enforcement vehicle, or drag racing may be charged as homicide or serious injury by vehicle, which are class \"B\" (OWI causing death), \"C\" (reckless driving or eluding causing death) or \"D\" (OWI, reckless driving, or eluding causing serious injury; drag racing causing death) felonies. These felonies carry significant higher penalties and sanctions, including fines of up to $10,000, mandatory restitution of $150,000, mandatory imprisonment of 25 years, and mandatory suspension of driving privileges for six years for a class \"B\" felony conviction. ** The Iowa DOT also has authority under Iowa Code 321.210 and 761 Iowa Administrative Code to suspend the driving privilege of a person convicted for a moving violation that contributed to a fatal motor vehicle accident for at least 120 days. Typical suspensions under this authority are for a period of one year. Although misdemeanor convictions do not pose the same penalties as felony convictions, they often have other effects on a person's life. Employers often run background checks, and when they do, a misdemeanor is a criminal offense that will appear on the report. A misdemeanor can also cause problems with obtaining security clearances. Kim Snook, former director of the Iowa DOT's Driver & Identification Services, said, \"We hope that these increased penalties and sanctions will make driver's think twice before foolishly choosing to pass a stopped school bus. More than thinking about their own penalty, however, we hope they will remember and recognize that passing a stopped school bus threatens the life of a child.

If a motorist has a lapse in SR22 coverage, then the insurance company notifies the DMV by submitting a form SR26. Once the DMV receives notification that insurance has lapsed, the state notifies the driver with information on how to resolve the issue. Drivers who fail to submit an SR22 form or proof of financial responsibility must post security in the way of money certified check, cashiers check or surety bond. The IDOT will only reinstate driving privileges after the suspension period and after the motorist has met the appropriate insurance requirements.\n\nIn some states a person can get away with a first DUI or drunk driving offense with little more than a traffic ticket. Iowa, however, does not think that there’s any excuse for putting lives at risk on the road. In fact, Iowa has a comprehensive approach to all types of DUI incidents, whether or not injury, death or property damage was involved. The state won’t let an offender walk out of court with a slap on the wrist; a driver with a first-offense Iowa DUI has a long road to recovery ahead. A first-offense Iowa DUI means that the driver will likely face:\n- Court costs and fines. - Substance abuse evaluation and treatment. - Vehicle immobilization or impoundment. - Community service. - Jail time. But there’s still more to consider; the job market can be difficult, and receiving a criminal charge can greatly reduce your chances of landing the job you want. An Iowa DUI can also cause your license to be revoked or suspended, too. If that’s the case, you’ll have to have ignition interlock device installed in your personal vehicle or any vehicles you drive regularly. Remember that with the strict consequences of a first-offense DUI, Iowa will increase those penalties for any and all additional drunk driving incidents, including the jail time, ignition interlock requirement, fines and more. If it seems like a lot of trouble for one DUI, it is. That’s why it’s essential to have a plan to get home before you go out drinkig. There are no good excuses for driving drunk – and certainly none that Iowa will consider when you are in court.\n\nPossible Penalties for a First-Offense DWI in the State of Connecticut\nInterviewer: For a first-time DWI offense that is not aggravated or enhanced, what are the possible penalties that you could face? After Successful Completion of an Alcohol Education Program, First Offenders May Have the Charges Dismissed\nJack O’Donnell: Individuals would be looking at, as a first offender, being eligible for the alcohol education program which, if after you successfully complete the program the charges are dismissed. You Will Be Charged a Fee to Attend the Alcohol Education Classes\nYou might have to attend 10 classes or you might have to attend 15 classes. 10 classes would cost you $350, 15 classes would cost you $500, and then at the end of a year, if you haven’t picked up a new DWI, the charges will be dismissed. You Can Still Face a Loss of Driving Privileges through the Department of Motor Vehicle Action\nYou still can lose your license through the Department of Motor Vehicles but the alcohol education program is something that you try to get for most first-time DWI offenders. Is Self-Representation a Viable Option to Defend Your DWI Charge in Connecticut? Interviewer: Are the alcohol education classes difficult to get into? Jack O’Donnell: As defense attorneys, we do try to inform our clients that the outcome is never guaranteed, plus being represented by an attorney can get you in and out of court a lot faster than if you are not being represented by legal counsel. Considering Self-Representation? It Is Difficult to Navigate the Judicial System but Online Information Is Available\nAs a layperson, it is very difficult to navigate the judicial system. However, people will research online and learn that it’s probably an easy thing for them to do themselves. Considering the Consequences of a DWI Conviction or a Denial into the Alcohol Education Program, Is Self-Representation Really the Best Option? Interviewer: But it is safe to say it would be a lot easier and the outcome would be more certain if you had an attorney at your side instead of representing yourself. Jack O’Donnell: That’s right. This is because no two judges are the same as far as granting admittance into these programs. This is why it’s just prudent to have an experienced attorney who can advise you on all aspects of the program and evaluate whether or not you should even be applying for the program. Does Your DWI Case Have Valid Defensible Issues? It Is Possible That the Alcohol Education Program Isn’t the Best Option\nFor example, maybe there are some defensible issues in this particular case and you make the prosecutor take a long, hard look at it. Then, the alcohol program would be a fallback position as opposed to your go-to option. Interviewer: If the alcohol education program is not an option, what are the possible penalties someone will face for a first time DUI? First-Time DWI Offenders May Face a Six Month Jail Sentence; More Likely the Penalties Will Comprise Fines, Probation and a License Suspension\nJack O’Donnell: The possible penalty is six months in jail. However, you are not likely to be sentenced six months in jail unless something really egregious transpired. Your license will be suspended and then you’d be placed on probation for 18 months. There’d be a $500 fine, probation costs of $200 and court costs would get you up to almost $795. First-Time Offenders May Be Eligible for a Permit to Drive to and from Their Place of Employment\nConnecticut still may issue a work permit that enables driving to and from work. However, that’s only for our first-timer offenders who are subject to the 90-day license suspension. The work permit serves as a partial driving privilege restoration for those 90 days. Driver’s with License Suspensions for Twelve Months Will Be Required to Install an Ignition Interlock Device in Order to Drive within That Year\nIf you lost your license for 120 days, you can get the work permit for 120 days, but if you lost it for a year, you had no ability to go to work. They now order the installation of an ignition interlock device, which is now available to people after 45 days. However, in that case, you are still without a license for 45 days.\n\n2013 ORS § 153.992¹\nPenalty for failure to appear\n(1) A person commits the offense of failure to appear in a violation proceeding if the person has been served with a violation citation issued under this chapter and the person knowingly fails to do any of the following:\n(a) Make a first appearance in the manner required by ORS 153.061 (Appearance by defendant) within the time allowed. (b) Make appearance at the time set for trial in the violation proceeding. (c) Appear at any other time required by the court or by law. (2) Failure to appear on a violation citation is a Class A misdemeanor. [1999 c.1051 §29]\n\nIowa Bench Warrants\nDon't Skip A Court Date In Iowa\nIf the police pull you over and run your license and you've got an outstanding warrant, your afternoon is not going to go the way you'd hoped. A \"bench warrant\" is a warrant for your arrest that's been issued by the \"bench\" (by the judge.) It means that a judge has directed police officers to arrest you if they find you. Why Do I Have a Bench Warrant? There are a few reasons you could have a bench warrant. Bench warrants are commonly issued when someone doesn't complete a requirement of their sentence, doesn't pay a fine or court costs, or, most commonly, doesn't show up for a court date. Failure to Appear Penalties\nIt may be a simple misdemeanor to willfully fail to appear for your court date when you've been directed to show up by a citation (like a speeding ticket.) In addition, the court can punish you for contempt. If you're out on bail, you'll forfeit bail -- that means you or whoever bailed you out won't get their money back when the case is over. If the court lets you out on bail again, the bail amount you're expected to pay will probably be higher than the bail amount that you forfeited was, and it will likely be \"cash only\" bail, which means you'll have to pay the whole thing in cash (no bail bonds allowed) or hang out in jail until your case is over. If you have an active arrest warrant, this is a good time to get in touch with a criminal defense lawyer at Clark & Sears Law. We can't guarantee any particular outcome, but we can sit down with you and talk about your case. It won't cost you anything. Your chances of resolving a bench warrant without getting arrested are better if you talk to an attorney, resolve any issues underlying the warrant (such as not paying a fine) and then arrange to appear before a judge instead of waiting for a cop to pick you up for speeding or for breathing too loudly in public. If we take your case, we can set up text (or email) reminders for your court dates, if you'd like, so that you won't forget and miss another one.\n\nOriginally Posted by Bonnie\nI was trying to look up Iowa law for \"failure to appear\" and I happened on one site where a man found out Iowa had had a bench warrant out on him for six years and he had just found out about it (not sure how). He had been living in San Francisco that whole time. In his case it looks like it might have been some administration foul up to do with his community service which he had completed but for some reason might not have been recorded. He was asking the question, \"Should he contact a lawyer about sorting it out, or contact the Iowa authorities himself?\" I'd have a lawyer call for him. Also, I couldn't find anything about a failure to appear problem, legally recorded, against Jeremy. That \"description\" is coming from statements, without any proof that he is being arrested for that type of crime. It sounds more like he has a warrant out for him for felony assault. If I can find more info, I'll make sure to post it here.\n\n### Question: Is there a financial penalty for not showing up to a scheduled OWI class in Iowa?","passages":[{"passage":"If you are charged with committing a second OWI offense, then a conviction results in a charge for an aggravated misdemeanor.

The time that the person spends in the inpatient treatment shall be credited against the defendant's sentence. The degree or severity of a particular OWI offense is determined by the number of OWI convictions that occurred within the previous 12 years. Iowa Code § 321.12(4).

We can't guarantee any particular outcome, but we can sit down with you and talk about your case. It won't cost you anything. Your chances of resolving a bench warrant without getting arrested are better if you talk to an attorney, resolve any issues underlying the warrant (such as not paying a fine) and then arrange to appear before a judge instead of waiting for a cop to pick you up for speeding or for breathing too loudly in public. If we take your case, we can set up text (or email) reminders for your court dates, if you'd like, so that you won't forget and miss another one.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:2ffb586e-c613-4027-a9cb-ea5a645c2a34>"]},{"passage":"Originally Posted by Bonnie\nI was trying to look up Iowa law for \"failure to appear\" and I happened on one site where a man found out Iowa had had a bench warrant out on him for six years and he had just found out about it (not sure how).

When we think about disaster recovery, we tend to think of rebuilding homes and businesses, repairing infrastructure, enforcing building codes, paying for new construction, and rebuilding the tax base. But communities are made up of people, and a community’s recovery process is not just material rebuilding and economic recovery. Recovery involves rebuilding emotional resilience and the individual and collective spirit of the community. Emergency managers can take steps before, during, and after a disaster that help facilitate the emotional healing process for survivors, response personnel, volunteers—for anyone in the community whose life or loved ones are touched by the event.

What Is Emergency Management? Throughout our Nation’s history, communities have always bonded together when disaster strikes. Emergency management simply creates a framework to help communities reduce vulnerabilities to threats and hazards and cope with disasters. Emergency management is an essential role of government. The Constitution tasks the States with responsibility for public health and safety―hence, they are responsible for public risks, while the Federal Government’s ultimate obligation is to help when State, local, or individual entities are overwhelmed. The overall goals of emergency management at all levels are:\n- First, to reduce the loss of life;\n- Then, to minimize property loss and damage to the environment;\n- And finally, to protect the jurisdiction from all threats and hazards. We tend to think of emergency management as a relatively new concept. However, the idea of assessing risks and organizing to deal with those risks has been around, in one fashion or another, since humans began forming civilizations. Our current vision of emergency management has not always been the same as it is today. Rather, it has evolved to reflect our national values and the threats we face. Today we seek to create a secure and resilient Nation. We have learned that doing so requires that we work together to build and sustain capabilities across the whole community to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from the threats and hazards that pose the greatest risk. What Is Emergency Management? There are numerous definitions of emergency management. The definition below is based on the one developed by the International Association of Emergency Managers (IAEM). Why Emergency Management? The reasons for the emergency management function are timeless and enduring, and include the following:\n- Threats and hazards exist—always have and always will. - Experience and empirical observation indicate that disaster events have a significant impact on humans and the environment. - Success in dealing with disasters depends primarily on how well prepared, organized, and coordinated we are. - Experience has shown that emergency management principles and practices actually work to achieve successful outcomes. Integrated Emergency Management\nEmergency management must be integrated into daily decisions, not just during times of disasters. Integrated emergency management:\n- Is a way of thinking about emergency management as a joint enterprise among the whole community among government, key community partners, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector. - Embodies an all-threats\/hazards approach to the direction, control, and coordination of disasters regardless of their location, size, or complexity. - Increases emergency management capability through:\n- Prior networks, linkages, and partnerships. - Communication across organizational and jurisdictional boundaries. - Creative thinking about resource shortfalls. - Coordinated testing, training, and exercising. - Improved ability to see the “big picture” for simultaneous responses.\n\nEducation and Preparedness (12)||-Provide: drill\/audit\/talk||√||√||√||√|\n|-Knowledge and skill in different disaster situations||√||√||√|\n|-Understand role in disaster assignment||√||√|\n|-Basic life support, CPR skills||√|\n|-Updating information about new diseases||√|\n|-Training in IT and communication skills||√|\n|-Skills in psychological intervention||√|\n|-Understanding of the nature of disasters||√|\n|6.

These programs range in focus from cyber-security and database management to disaster response workshops and high-level policy analyses. Despite the design of the individual course, an emergency management curriculum must include the following three competencies. Any prospective student of such a program should be basing their decision on this structure and any graduate of such a program should be able to:\n- Adopt a “Comprehensive Emergency Management” framework – comprehensive emergency management can best be summarized as: “all hazards, all phases and all actors.” This means emergency managers who are proficient in using new technologies such as fixed and mobile asset management platforms to coordinate with other agencies and jurisdictions to best deploy resources and personnel. The focus is a balanced approach to emergency management capabilities and readiness. - Integrate with other Emergency Managers and Agencies – The property management and emergency management industries are trending towards a culture of inter-agency cooperation and collaboration. Cooperation has resulted in increased productivity, a repealing of inflexible and inefficient bureaucratic stalling, and most importantly, an economical use of shared resources. Emergency managers must use fixed and mobile asset management software to gain total asset visibility into a range of fixed and mobile asset inventories. This requires that emergency management organizations work to get other governmental organizations within their jurisdiction to “integrate” fixed and mobile asset resources and broader emergency management concerns (such as risk assessment, planning, training, exercise participation) into their thinking, systems and operations. - Master the New Technologies, Technical Systems and Property Management Standards – students need to learn the tools of the trade. Social media is factoring heavily into communicating disaster response efforts and educating the public of potential and on-going disasters. As such, emergency management students must learn to embrace social media strategies in an effort to harness and embrace the medium. Moreover, as FEMA and the DHS impose stricter and more targeted grant stipulations, emergency managers must become proficient with software that manage not only the deployment and maintenance of fixed and mobile asset inventories but their highly-valuable financial data as well such as depreciation. Among the technological topics today’s emergency management students must embrace are:\n- National Incident Management System (NIMS)\n- National Response Plan (NRP)\n- NFPA 1600 (National Fire Protection Association “Standard for Disaster\/Emergency Management and Business Continuity Programs”)\n- Certified Emergency Manager credential administered by the International Association of Emergency Managers\n- Geospatial and geographical information systems (GPS and GIS)\n- Communications systems\n- Warning systems\n- Computers and hazard and emergency management related software packages\n\nUnderstand the key factors of preparing for, responding to, and maintaining control throughout the development or escalation of an emergency situation. Learn how to manage communication, emergency-related information and put into place predetermined plans at the point when the emergency alarm has been raised, to the point when the emergency manager is assured that the emergency is over. Understand how stress can impact individuals and team performance during emergencies. Have the opportunity to role-play as the emergency manager in a minimum of two specific types of emergency scenarios. This is a key element of the training program and is backed up by constructive feedback from the course instructional team.\n\nWould a career in the emergency services suit me? Quick links for this article\nIf you can keep a calm head in a crisis, a career in the emergency services could be your calling. Whether you’re in the police or ambulance service, a trainee firefighter or an emergency planner, you’ll need to be a good team player who is capable of handling stress and making decisions under pressure. You’ll also be physically fit and emotionally resilient, with a can-do attitude and plenty of stamina. Working in the emergency services tends to appeal to people who want variety, are happy dealing with the general public and don’t want the kind of office job that involves being tied to a desk. You’re also likely to need to be willing to work unsocial hours. For example, as a paramedic you will usually be expected to work some shifts on weekends and Bank Holidays, and at night. Police shift patterns vary between forces but you are usually expected to cover a range of shifts, including earlies, lates and nights. A career in the emergency services offers job satisfaction, good prospects for promotion and progression and access to training and development opportunities. On the downside, it can be stressful and you may have to deal with distressing or dangerous situations. Most emergency services careers are in the public sector, at least to start with, so if you want to begin your career in a commercial environment in the private sector, this is not the most obvious career choice for you. You can find out more about the range of roles available from our advice on jobs and employers in the emergency services. If you work as a paramedic or emergency care assistant you’ll be involved in responding to a range of situations where patients need care urgently, for example if they have potentially life-threatening injuries caused by a road accident. Here are some of the skills and qualities you’ll need:\n- depending on your role, you might need driving skills\n- calm, reassuring manner\n- capable of using initiative and making sound decisions under pressure\n- not squeamish\n- good communicator and listener who is willing to work as a member of a team. As a police officer, you’ll work to maintain law and order. This involves supporting crime prevention initiatives as well as investigating crime, gathering evidence and bringing offenders to court. You’ll need the following skills to succeed:\n- capable of a firm but tactful approach\n- willing to give and receive instructions and to respond quickly to a situation and take action\n- resilience, honesty, confidence, common sense and a responsible attitude. Firefighters protect and save people and property from fire and other dangers. They also advise and educate the general public about fire prevention. You’ll need the following strengths and characteristics to suit the work:\n- able to remain calm in dangerous situations and to inspire confidence when dealing with members of the public\n- able to take an assertive approach when needed if there are potential obstacles to your rescue work\n- willing to work in very uncomfortable situations, for example, at heights or in enclosed buildings\n- able to follow instructions and regulations and write accurate incident reports. Emergency planners liaise with professionals from different emergency services to prepare plans and procedures to deal with major incidents. They also draw up plans to put preventative measures in place and help to coordinate the response to large-scale emergencies. You’ll need the following skills to be suited to this career path:\n- excellent communication skills, as emergency planning often involves liaising with a range of agencies or departments\n- capable of analysing complex problems and taking a strategic approach to planning potential solutions\n- sound organisational, presentational and project management skills\n- you’re also likely to have worked in another area of the emergency services before you move into a planning role.\n\nCommunity Emergency Response Team CERT Program\nWhat will I learn? - Disaster Preparedness\n- Fire Safety\n- Disaster Medical Operations- Assessment, Treatment, and Hygiene\n- Light Search and Rescue\n- Team Organization\n- Disaster Psychology\n- Terrorism and CERT\nAs a CERT graduate you will be able to:\n- Describe the types of hazards most likely to affect their homes and communities. - Describe the function of CERT and their roles in immediate response. - Take steps to prepare themselves for a disaster. - Identify and reduce potential fire hazards in their homes and workplaces. - Work as a team to apply basic fire suppression strategies, resources, and safety measures to extinguish a burning liquid. - Apply techniques for opening airways, controlling bleeding, and treating shock. - Conduct triage under simulated conditions. - Perform head-to-toe assessments. - Select and set up a treatment area. - Employ basic treatments for various wounds. - Identify planning and size-up requirements for potential search and rescue situations. - Describe the most common techniques for searching a structure. - Use safe techniques for debris removal and victim extrication. - Describe ways to protect rescuers during search and rescue.\n\nHealth and Social Services Restore and improve health and social services networks to promote the resilience, independence, health (including behavioral health), and well-being of the whole community. Housing Implement housing solutions that effectively support the needs of the whole community and contribute to its sustainability and resilience. Infrastructure Systems Stabilize critical infrastructure functions, minimize health and safety threats, and efficiently restore and revitalize systems and services to support a viable, resilient community. Natural and Cultural Resources Protect natural and cultural resources and historic properties through appropriate planning, mitigation, response, and recovery actions to preserve, conserve, rehabilitate, and restore them consistent with post-disaster community priorities and best practices and in compliance with appropriate environmental and historical preservation laws and executive orders. National Preparedness System\nThe National Preparedness System is an integrated set of guidance, programs, and processes that enables the whole community to achieve the National Preparedness Goal. - Identifying and Assessing Risk\n- Estimating Capability Requirements\n- Building and Sustaining Capabilities\n- Planning to Deliver Capabilities\n- Validating Capabilities\n- Reviewing and Updating\nNational Incident Management System (NIMS)\nNIMS represents a core set of doctrines, concepts, principles, terminology, and organizational processes that enable effective, efficient, and collaborative incident management. NIMS integrates best practices into a comprehensive, standardized system that focuses on five key areas:\n- Communications and Information Management\n- Resource Management\n- Command and Management\n- Ongoing Management and Maintenance\nThis system is flexible enough to be used across the full spectrum of potential incidents, regardless of cause, size, location, or complexity. Using NIMS allows us to work together to prepare for, prevent, protect against, mitigate the effects of, respond to, and recover from incidents.

What Does It Mean To Be an Emergency Manager? There is no single model for emergency management, either in organization or in size. Nationwide, there is great variety. For example, emergency management may function as a separate organization. In an ideal situation, the emergency manager answers directly to the jurisdiction’s chief executive, giving the executive direct access to unfiltered information from the emergency manager. In many communities emergency management is a function within the fire\/rescue, public safety, or law enforcement department. Often it is part of a volunteer department. Staff size may run the gamut from a single part-time or shared position, to a full-time employee, to a full-time director with a large staff, each with assigned areas of responsibility. Legal Duties of an Emergency Manager\nThe legal duties of emergency managers are based in:\n- Local emergency management ordinances. - State or tribal emergency management laws. - Standards such as NIMS and National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 1600. - Laws of general application (Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), civil rights, contract law, personnel law, government ethics law, etc.). Local, tribal, and State emergency management statutes and ordinances typically include a list of position responsibilities for various key players, including the emergency manager.\n\nMessage from Head of Department\nEmergency and Disaster management is a profession!

What Is Emergency Management? Throughout our Nation’s history, communities have always bonded together when disaster strikes. Emergency management simply creates a framework to help communities reduce vulnerabilities to threats and hazards and cope with disasters. Emergency management is an essential role of government. The Constitution tasks the States with responsibility for public health and safety―hence, they are responsible for public risks, while the Federal Government’s ultimate obligation is to help when State, local, or individual entities are overwhelmed. The overall goals of emergency management at all levels are:\n- First, to reduce the loss of life;\n- Then, to minimize property loss and damage to the environment;\n- And finally, to protect the jurisdiction from all threats and hazards. We tend to think of emergency management as a relatively new concept. However, the idea of assessing risks and organizing to deal with those risks has been around, in one fashion or another, since humans began forming civilizations. Our current vision of emergency management has not always been the same as it is today. Rather, it has evolved to reflect our national values and the threats we face. Today we seek to create a secure and resilient Nation. We have learned that doing so requires that we work together to build and sustain capabilities across the whole community to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from the threats and hazards that pose the greatest risk. What Is Emergency Management? There are numerous definitions of emergency management. The definition below is based on the one developed by the International Association of Emergency Managers (IAEM). Why Emergency Management? The reasons for the emergency management function are timeless and enduring, and include the following:\n- Threats and hazards exist—always have and always will. - Experience and empirical observation indicate that disaster events have a significant impact on humans and the environment. - Success in dealing with disasters depends primarily on how well prepared, organized, and coordinated we are. - Experience has shown that emergency management principles and practices actually work to achieve successful outcomes. Integrated Emergency Management\nEmergency management must be integrated into daily decisions, not just during times of disasters. Integrated emergency management:\n- Is a way of thinking about emergency management as a joint enterprise among the whole community among government, key community partners, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector. - Embodies an all-threats\/hazards approach to the direction, control, and coordination of disasters regardless of their location, size, or complexity. - Increases emergency management capability through:\n- Prior networks, linkages, and partnerships. - Communication across organizational and jurisdictional boundaries. - Creative thinking about resource shortfalls. - Coordinated testing, training, and exercising. - Improved ability to see the “big picture” for simultaneous responses.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:c9e76d0f-8e7f-4444-bb59-15589f9fe9ca>"]},{"passage":"Education and Preparedness (12)||-Provide: drill\/audit\/talk||√||√||√||√|\n|-Knowledge and skill in different disaster situations||√||√||√|\n|-Understand role in disaster assignment||√||√|\n|-Basic life support, CPR skills||√|\n|-Updating information about new diseases||√|\n|-Training in IT and communication skills||√|\n|-Skills in psychological intervention||√|\n|-Understanding of the nature of disasters||√|\n|6.

These programs range in focus from cyber-security and database management to disaster response workshops and high-level policy analyses. Despite the design of the individual course, an emergency management curriculum must include the following three competencies. Any prospective student of such a program should be basing their decision on this structure and any graduate of such a program should be able to:\n- Adopt a “Comprehensive Emergency Management” framework – comprehensive emergency management can best be summarized as: “all hazards, all phases and all actors.” This means emergency managers who are proficient in using new technologies such as fixed and mobile asset management platforms to coordinate with other agencies and jurisdictions to best deploy resources and personnel. The focus is a balanced approach to emergency management capabilities and readiness. - Integrate with other Emergency Managers and Agencies – The property management and emergency management industries are trending towards a culture of inter-agency cooperation and collaboration. Cooperation has resulted in increased productivity, a repealing of inflexible and inefficient bureaucratic stalling, and most importantly, an economical use of shared resources. Emergency managers must use fixed and mobile asset management software to gain total asset visibility into a range of fixed and mobile asset inventories. This requires that emergency management organizations work to get other governmental organizations within their jurisdiction to “integrate” fixed and mobile asset resources and broader emergency management concerns (such as risk assessment, planning, training, exercise participation) into their thinking, systems and operations. - Master the New Technologies, Technical Systems and Property Management Standards – students need to learn the tools of the trade. Social media is factoring heavily into communicating disaster response efforts and educating the public of potential and on-going disasters. As such, emergency management students must learn to embrace social media strategies in an effort to harness and embrace the medium. Moreover, as FEMA and the DHS impose stricter and more targeted grant stipulations, emergency managers must become proficient with software that manage not only the deployment and maintenance of fixed and mobile asset inventories but their highly-valuable financial data as well such as depreciation. Among the technological topics today’s emergency management students must embrace are:\n- National Incident Management System (NIMS)\n- National Response Plan (NRP)\n- NFPA 1600 (National Fire Protection Association “Standard for Disaster\/Emergency Management and Business Continuity Programs”)\n- Certified Emergency Manager credential administered by the International Association of Emergency Managers\n- Geospatial and geographical information systems (GPS and GIS)\n- Communications systems\n- Warning systems\n- Computers and hazard and emergency management related software packages","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:900654d3-ef19-443d-b60c-ebd7c3b7688a>"]},{"passage":"Understand the key factors of preparing for, responding to, and maintaining control throughout the development or escalation of an emergency situation.

What Does It Mean To Be an Emergency Manager? There is no single model for emergency management, either in organization or in size. Nationwide, there is great variety. For example, emergency management may function as a separate organization. In an ideal situation, the emergency manager answers directly to the jurisdiction’s chief executive, giving the executive direct access to unfiltered information from the emergency manager. In many communities emergency management is a function within the fire\/rescue, public safety, or law enforcement department. Often it is part of a volunteer department. Staff size may run the gamut from a single part-time or shared position, to a full-time employee, to a full-time director with a large staff, each with assigned areas of responsibility. Legal Duties of an Emergency Manager\nThe legal duties of emergency managers are based in:\n- Local emergency management ordinances. - State or tribal emergency management laws. - Standards such as NIMS and National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 1600. - Laws of general application (Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), civil rights, contract law, personnel law, government ethics law, etc.).

In addition to the shock absorbers, Rittmeyer selected ACE LOCKED PN clamping elements to use in its cable cutting machine. These components are designed to immediately clamp in the event the machine loses pressure as it moves concentrically along two guide shafts, protecting both the operators and the machine itself. They also prevent movement during the cutting process—a critical function, as even the slightest cutting inaccuracy can have serious repercussions in automotive or aerospace applications.\nSuitable for rods with diameters of 20 to 40 mm, LOCKED PN clamping elements absorb forces axially and rotationally. With a holding force of up to 36,000 N, they also reach or exceed the levels of hydraulic clamps without the high cost.","question_category":"non-factoid","question_category_desc":"A question to get advice or recommendations on a particular topic.

Specifically, maintenance-free hydraulic shock absorbers protect both personnel and equipment by ensuring gentle impact of moving parts, while pneumatic clamping elements provide protection by immediately clamping if pressure is lost during operation. The clamping elements also prevent movement during cutting, which is crucial as even slight cutting inaccuracies can have serious consequences in automotive applications.","answer":"When selecting a cable cutting machine for automotive applications, it is crucial to prioritize safety to protect operators and bystanders from potential hazards. Here are some of the best safety features to consider:\n\n1. **Interlock Systems**: Machines with interlock systems automatically stop the cutting process if the guard is opened or if there is an attempt to reach into the cutting area. This prevents accidental injuries during maintenance or unexpected interruptions.\n\n2. **Safety Guards and Barriers**: Physical barriers that enclose the cutting mechanism are essential. These guards should be designed to prevent access to the cutting area and should have openings no larger than half an inch to prevent fingers or other body parts from entering.\n\n3. **Emergency Stop (E-Stop) Buttons**: Easy-to-reach emergency stop buttons allow operators to quickly halt the machine in case of an emergency or if a hazard is detected.\n\n4. **Machine Guards with Light Curtains**: For machines where visibility is a concern, photo light curtains can be used as an additional layer of protection. These sensors detect when an operator or object enters the danger zone and immediately stop the machine.\n\n5. **In-built Safety Features**: Look for machines that come with built-in safety features such as overload protection, thermal overload protection, and circuit breakers to prevent damage and potential hazards.\n\n6. **Foot Controls**: Machines with foot controls allow operators to maintain a safe distance from the cutting area while still being able to operate the machine.\n\n7. **Noise and Vibration Reduction**: Automotive workshops can be noisy and vibrate a lot. Machines designed with noise and vibration reduction features can improve the working environment and reduce operator fatigue.\n\n8. **Clear Instructions and Warnings**: Machines with clear instructions and warnings about proper use, maintenance, and safety procedures are essential. This includes labeling of all controls, switches, and potential hazards.\n\n9. **Regular Maintenance and Inspections**: Ensure that the machine is regularly maintained and inspected according to the manufacturer's guidelines. This includes checking guards, wiring, and other safety components for wear and tear.\n\n10. **Training and Awareness**: Operators should receive proper training on how to safely use the machine, including how to operate it, perform routine maintenance, and respond to emergencies.\n\n11. **Compliance with Standards**: Make sure the machine complies with relevant safety standards and regulations, such as those set by OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) or other national and international safety organizations.\n\n12. **Secure Work Area**: Ensure that the work area is free from clutter and that there are no tripping hazards, which can be exacerbated by the use of a cable cutting machine.\n\nIncorporating these safety features into your cable cutting machine will help minimize the risk of accidents and ensure a safer working environment in automotive applications.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: To explore hazards specific to automotive and request more information on how to make Ansell your safety partner, start here\nHand-related injuries are one of the most common forms of worker injures in Automotive Manufacturing environments. These types of injuries can range from small cuts and lacerations to life-altering damage and can be costly for both a company and its employees. Accidents and injuries can lead to increased employee time away from work, lost productivity, and even a physical inability to return to work at all. Here are 5 ways to help you and your workers stay safe in Automotive environments:\n1. Identify Your Risk\nIt is important to know what risks you are exposed to in your working environment. These risks can vary with application and can range from cut and abrasion to chemical and oil, even to electrical, heat or impact-related risks. Familiarize yourself with the tools, materials and surroundings in which you are exposed. By identifying all environmental hazards, you can effectively protect your team from dangerous situations, ultimately reducing the number of potential accidents and resulting injuries. 2. Choose the Correct PPE\nWe all know cost factors into the decision-making process of purchasing personal protective equipment (PPE). However, you never want to sacrifice protection for price. Three questions you should always ask yourself when choosing the correct PPE for your team are:\nI. Is my team protected from the surrounding environmental risks? II. Is my team receiving the level of protection necessary to complete their tasks safely? For example, a task that requires Cut Level A7 protection is very different than a task that requires Cut Level A2 protection. III. Are my team members wearing the right sized-gloves? Workers are more inclined to remove their hand protection and expose their bare hands to environmental risks due to wearing ill-fitting gloves. Eliminate these chances by ensuring your team is wearing the correct sized gloves at all times. 3. Remove All Jewelry\nWearing jewelry in an Automotive Manufacturing environment is a major safety hazard and can result in very serious injuries. These injuries can include cuts, amputations, even electric shock! Note, the term “jewelry” is not limited to earrings, bracelets and necklaces. It also includes jewelry which may be covered by clothing such as ankle bracelets, toe rings and body piercings, or fit snug against your skin such as rings or stud earrings. Remove all jewelry before entering your working environment to save your limbs and your life! 4. Identify Safety Features on Machinery & Power Tools\nBefore using any machinery equipment or power tool, ensure that you have a full understanding of the available safety features and how they function. It’s always better to be over-prepared than under-prepared when it comes to using a piece of equipment where one accident could have life-altering consequences. 5. Stay Alert\nOnce familiarized with or accustomed to daily tasks and responsibilities, it is easy to fall into autopilot mode as you go about your day. The most simple and effective way to keep your hands safe and protected is to always be aware of your surroundings and stay focused on the task at hand. Accidents happen. But with the correct PPE and safety protocols in place, these accidents can happen less frequently and lead to a safer and more prepared workforce.\n\nFactors to Consider when Looking for Cable Handling Equipment\nWith the growing technology, a lot of cables have come into play in most companies and industries. There are numerous areas that cables have to be applied for things to work out as they should. At times, wires can get messy; they can leave things looking untidy and unkempt. When cables are not installed and managed the right way, the chances are that they may end up not functioning as they should. When you are in an industry that requires the use of numerous cables, you have to make sure that their installation and other services to them is done to the level best and with the right technology. Human is to error, and mostly, with such a manual duty of handling cables, there are chances that things might get faulty or lack a lasting installation touch. It is, therefore, best to work with a cable handling equipment, because then, you can be sure that things will work out in perfection and there is barely anything that will be left out unattended. Your work will also be more comfortable because the functionality of a machine can never be compared to human duty.

Workers must pay close attention to what they’re doing, no matter what task is being\nsomeone is going to get hurt. In 1985, one Chicago parts manufacturing company had 41.8\ninjury cases per 100 full-time employees, roughly four\ntimes that of the industry. Well, that number has come down significantly over the years as better safety\nprocesses have been implemented, plant inspections have increased, and PPE technology has been worn. The parts manufacturing industry, NAICS 3363, experiences around 22% more injuries than the average for all\nindustries. However, when you peel the onion back on this industry, tne sub-industry today that should\nsafety and PPE rather seriously is the motor vehicle stamping industry. 6.3 injuries occur for every 100\nemployees, which is 36% higher than the average for all parts manufacturing sub-industries. It is 50%\nthan the 3.2 average for all U.S. industries.

What are some specifications and standards I should consider when choosing automotive cable? Common standards for the automotive industry include those created by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), Underwriters Laboratories (UL), and the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association (RVIA). All of these organizations develop standards for the automotive industry to encourage the manufacture and use of safe and high quality automotive wire and cable. More important specifications to consider are those set by individual car manufacturers. For instance, all of Allied’s primary wire meets both Ford and Chrysler specifications.\n\nAutomotive plant workers are exposed to a laundry list of workplace hazards that require safety gear. Automobile frames are primarily metal, so arm, hand, and eye injuries are a constant concern, especially if incorrect PPE is worn. Since the assembly line remains the core place where automobile components come together and are assembled, many injuries occur there. Those who are responsible for assembling vehicles are exposed to harsh work conditions while performing a wide variety of repetitive tasks. They bolt, clip, place, and fasten thousands of parts together, all around sharp metal. Worker placing automobile parts with the 92743PU, a high-cut and high-dexterity glove. This blog focuses on automotive assembly PPE and production safety gear, specifically the gloves assemblers should wear. Safety in Automotive\nGood news – automotive injury rates have been coming down! According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), automotive manufacturing injury cases decreased from a rate of 10.2 per 100 full-time workers in 2003 to a rate of 5.6 per 100 full-time workers in 2010. While the decrease in on-the-job injury numbers is welcome news, the dangers still exist. And with the increase in production of new electrical vehicles, the continued decline in injury rates isn’t guaranteed. As one of the Big 3 automakers told us at a recent AISTech tradeshow, electric vehicles require more and more thinner gauged metal. With thinner gauged metals, workers need better hand dexterity and grip. We’ve got some new designs that will allow for increased dexterity and grip and we’ll cover those more in-depth below. This chart shows the incident rates of non-fatal injury cases found across all automotive-related sub-industries\nRecordable cases per 100 employees\nWe highlight each one of the above sub-industries in our central Automotive resource page. Assembly Employment Across the Automotive Industry\nIn 2016, there were 1,819,300 people employed as assemblers and fabricators in the United States across a variety of industries, including the automotive industry. Unfortunately, the BLS projects that the total number of assembler and fabricator jobs is going to decline 14% by 2026, owing to advances in automation. On a more positive note, the largest segment of workers found in automotive are those assembling the finished product. Let’s look at more specific numbers of assemblers and fabricators in a few automotive sub-industries. In 2017:\n- 165,650 people worked in the motor vehicle parts manufacturing sub-industry. - 141,150 people worked in the motor vehicle manufacturing sub-industry. - 60,580 people worked in the motor vehicle body and trailer manufacturing sub-industry. We cover many aspects of these automotive specialties below. For even more insight, the BLS provides a complete page for this type of worker. BLS Handbook for Assemblers\nThe Assembly Line\nAs we highlight on our Automotive industry page, the assembly line was pioneered in the U.S. by Henry Ford. His improved manufacturing process continues to be the industry standard in automotive manufacturing and a multitude of other industries. On an automotive assembly line, simultaneous work activities are taking place at several different stations along the line. When one station is finished with an assembly activity, the vehicle passes on to the next. By having multiple stations functioning at one time, a larger volume of vehicles is produced. Here are some of the different stages of assembly:\n- Hard Trim – fitting instrument panels and steering columns\n- Soft Trim and Final Assembly – where a majority of workers are found fitting seats, door pads, and upholstery\nThe journey doesn’t end there. Other stations along the line install the engine, petrol tank, exhaust, and bumpers. We lay out all the steps of the process on our Automotive Vehicle Manufacturing resource page. Click the image below to check out all 16 steps found in the manufacturing of vehicles. The automotive manufacturing process\nAssembly and Fabrication Activities\nAssemblers and fabricators assemble all the parts into one functioning, finished trailer or vehicle. To accomplish their job, they use power tools, machines, and their hands to bring parts into a finished product.\n\nFeatured image by Vereshchagin Dmitry\nMost lift tables come with a ton of built-in safety features. For example, hydraulic lift tables come with solenoid valves that block oil flow, causing the table to stop in case the hydraulic system fails. Also, service locks that keep lift tables in place during servicing are standard. However, there are safety features that aren’t inherent, features that do not come as part of every pneumatic or hydraulic lift table. These are the safety features that you can request a manufacturer to add on to your lift table in order to create a safer working environment for your employees. Here are some of the top safety features you should consider asking for. Add Rails to a Lift Table\nYou can ask for rails to be added to a lift table. These rails can be as high as necessary to fit your specific needs. You can also ask for them to be extra fortified or to be at whatever angle you like. These rails will come in handy for keeping products or materials from tilting over or slipping when you are lowering or raising the table. This is especially so in cases when you are dealing with tall loads or loads that have to be stacked on top of each other. As a result, these rails will not only reduce the losses due to accidental damage but will also prevent accidental injuries to your employees\nRails on the lift table can also be used to provide extra support for workers. They can provide a place to hold onto when the table is in motion. Workers can also lean on them when working, allowing the table to serve as an ergonomic tool. Request Rugged Surfaces\nSince lift tables have different uses, standard lift tables do not have rugged surfaces. Some businesses even end up using them as lift-raise working platforms. However, if you use your lift table to raise loads or position workers, it is imperative that you insist on a grippy surface. This is because the extra grip from a rubberized or ruggedized surface will provide extra friction. This comes in handy in keeping the load in place when the table is in motion. Employees who use lift tables for positioning will also benefit from the extra friction. It will reduce the chances of slipping. And while workers are always advised to wipe off any moisture or oil spills as soon as they happen, mistakes can happen. In such cases, having a surface that has an extra grip can minimize the risk of accidental injuries. Customize Lift Tables with Safety Skirts\nSafety skirts are a great way to add a splash of style to your facility. This is because when you opt for a good manufacturer, like www.saxlift.com, your customization options are endless. You can choose whichever combination of colors you like. You can also have a say in the eventual shape of the safety skirts. However, they mainly serve as useful safety features. The alternating yellow and black folds that most businesses choose are visible to both the people operating the equipment and to other workers. With these colors, it is easy to see when the lift table is in motion, something that helps prevent accidents. Lift table safety skirts also prevent pieces of materials or even small products from getting into the moving parts of the lift table. This helps reduce the risks of mechanical failure. Furthermore, since the safety skirts can even be reinforced with steel rods, they can also keep the load from getting accidentally crushed. Workers can also benefit from having safety skirts installed on their lift tables. When used in conjunction with the anti-entrapment bar, safety skirts can become crucial in preventing horrific accidents that happen when workers’ limbs get trapped. RELATED ARTICLE: USING AND MAINTAINING INDUSTRIAL MACHINERY\nEnsure Workers Are Trained\nWhile requesting these additional safety features will help boost employee safety in your facility, they are not enough. These safety features are only effective when the machines are operated by people who are trained to operate them. Therefore, educating your employees on not only how to use the lift table but also what to do in case something goes wrong, is necessary if you want an accident-free work environment.\n\nChina Portable Wire Cutting Machine, Wire Rope Cutting\nChina Portable Wire Cutting Machine, Wire Rope Cutting Machine, Find details about China Cutting off Machine, Cutting Machine from Portable Wire Cutting Machine, Wire Rope Cutting Machine - Shandong Qifang Machinery Manufacturing Co., Ltd.\nHelp with finding tool to cut 1\/4\" Galvanized Steel\/Wire cable\nMight want to take a look at the wire rope and cable cutters made by HIT.

Often the hazard involves moving parts with the\npotential to cut, crush or draw-in body parts, although\nbarrier guards may also be necessary when electrical,\nthermal or chemical dangers are present. Guarding or protecting people from harm may be accomplished\nwith simple physical shielding of machine parts, or\nmore advanced techniques such as photo light curtains. It\nis also often necessary to employ interlocks to disable\npower to the machine when a guard has been removed. Accident risks can be reduced with adequate machine\nsafeguarding. Identifying obvious and hidden hazards\nshould be the first step in planning and reviewing the need\nfor machine tool safeguarding. Some hazards are subject\nto the ‘seven-foot rule, which dictates that these potentially\ndangerous operations be enclosed or guarded if they\nare located less than seven feet above the floor or platform\nlevel. Guards are required to have one-half-inch or\nsmaller openings. Blades and other overhead hazards—\nsuch as pulleys, belt rope and chain drives, overhead horizontal\nbelts, vertical and incline belts, gears, sprockets\nand chains—must comply with this rule. Most incidents leading to injury are the result of inadvertent\nor unwise contact with moving machine parts. Because\nof the great diversity of machine designs and functions,\nappropriate safeguarding to protect workers from such hazards\nmay also have numerous forms. Certain principles,\nhowever, are basic to any effective safeguarding design. Evaluation and Design\nA uniform process should be applied and used to evaluate\neach of the hazards on the machine to develop the required\nlevel of safeguarding. The evaluation can be performed by a\nknowledgeable and experienced person or, for more complicated\nmachine designs and safeguarding issues, the evaluation\ncan be conducted by a qualified third party. The OSHA\/ANSI hierarchy for controlling machine hazards\nis as follows:\nIf the results of the hazard evaluation show the equipment\nto be safe (that is, poses no hazard to the employee),\nchanges to the equipment may not be necessary. This\nmay be true for manually-powered equipment. - Eliminate the hazard by design\nControl the hazard by guarding or devices\n- Personal protective equipment\nAssessing the Risk: Many times the employer will want\nto know the answer to this question, “What do we fix\nfirst?” Once you have identified the danger areas (hazards),\nyou should assess the risk (how likely it is to cause\ninjury, and how severe the injury could be.) For every hazard that you identify on a machine, you\nmust then assign a risk factor to it. On the Probability\nchart listed below, decide what is the most predicable\ninjury that could occur, then assign a risk number to it. If you score a 1 or 2, do something NOW. If you score a 3 or 4, plan to do something soon. If you score a 5 or 6, plan to review the risk in the future. | CONSEQUENCE |\nHow severely could it hurt someone? | What is the likelihood of it happening? First aid only,\n|VERY LIKELY: |\n|VERY UNLIKELY: |\nIt could happen,\nWhen designing machine guards the safeguards must\nmeet these minimum general requirements:\nIn summary, employees working on or near machinery\nwith hazardous moving parts must be protected. OSHA\nrequires that such parts be guarded to ensure worker\nsafety. If unguarded, those parts could entangle a worker’s\nhands, hair or clothing and lead to injury or even death. Employers therefore should inspect equipment daily to\nmake sure that all guards are intact—especially after\nmaintenance or repair. - A guard is a protective device that PREVENTS anyone\nfrom reaching over, under, around or through the guard\nor guarding device. - An awareness barrier or chip shield can be used to\nwarn a person that they are coming in close proximity\nto a danger area. Other protective measures such as\ntraining or color coding must also be used so the person\nis reminded that they could potentially be injured if\nproper procedures are not followed. - Prevent contact: The safeguard must prevent hands,\narms, and any other part of the operator’s body from\nmaking contact with dangerous moving parts. A good\nsafeguarding system eliminates the possibility of the\noperator or another worker placing parts of their bodies\nnear hazardous moving parts.\n\n### Question: What are the best safety features to look for in a cable cutting machine for automotive applications?","passages":[{"passage":"To explore hazards specific to automotive and request more information on how to make Ansell your safety partner, start here\nHand-related injuries are one of the most common forms of worker injures in Automotive Manufacturing environments. These types of injuries can range from small cuts and lacerations to life-altering damage and can be costly for both a company and its employees. Accidents and injuries can lead to increased employee time away from work, lost productivity, and even a physical inability to return to work at all. Here are 5 ways to help you and your workers stay safe in Automotive environments:\n1. Identify Your Risk\nIt is important to know what risks you are exposed to in your working environment. These risks can vary with application and can range from cut and abrasion to chemical and oil, even to electrical, heat or impact-related risks. Familiarize yourself with the tools, materials and surroundings in which you are exposed. By identifying all environmental hazards, you can effectively protect your team from dangerous situations, ultimately reducing the number of potential accidents and resulting injuries. 2. Choose the Correct PPE\nWe all know cost factors into the decision-making process of purchasing personal protective equipment (PPE). However, you never want to sacrifice protection for price. Three questions you should always ask yourself when choosing the correct PPE for your team are:\nI. Is my team protected from the surrounding environmental risks? II. Is my team receiving the level of protection necessary to complete their tasks safely? For example, a task that requires Cut Level A7 protection is very different than a task that requires Cut Level A2 protection. III. Are my team members wearing the right sized-gloves? Workers are more inclined to remove their hand protection and expose their bare hands to environmental risks due to wearing ill-fitting gloves. Eliminate these chances by ensuring your team is wearing the correct sized gloves at all times. 3. Remove All Jewelry\nWearing jewelry in an Automotive Manufacturing environment is a major safety hazard and can result in very serious injuries. These injuries can include cuts, amputations, even electric shock! Note, the term “jewelry” is not limited to earrings, bracelets and necklaces. It also includes jewelry which may be covered by clothing such as ankle bracelets, toe rings and body piercings, or fit snug against your skin such as rings or stud earrings. Remove all jewelry before entering your working environment to save your limbs and your life! 4. Identify Safety Features on Machinery & Power Tools\nBefore using any machinery equipment or power tool, ensure that you have a full understanding of the available safety features and how they function. It’s always better to be over-prepared than under-prepared when it comes to using a piece of equipment where one accident could have life-altering consequences. 5. Stay Alert\nOnce familiarized with or accustomed to daily tasks and responsibilities, it is easy to fall into autopilot mode as you go about your day. The most simple and effective way to keep your hands safe and protected is to always be aware of your surroundings and stay focused on the task at hand. Accidents happen. But with the correct PPE and safety protocols in place, these accidents can happen less frequently and lead to a safer and more prepared workforce.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:26b6d2a4-9735-4b6c-96d1-5bbc764c9eed>"]},{"passage":"Factors to Consider when Looking for Cable Handling Equipment\nWith the growing technology, a lot of cables have come into play in most companies and industries.

Finding the Right Glove for Assembly Work\nWorker accuracy and speed are two areas of high importance when assembling components. This means choosing the right glove is extremely important, as a worker can’t afford downtime or limited hand movement when screwing in bolts, nuts, or parts. Their takt time will suffer! When choosing the right assembly gloves for your needs, you definitely need to consider the cut protection offered and the dip:\n- Cut-Resistant Gloves\nYou want to pay attention to the cut-resistance properties of any PPE that you purchase, including gloves and sleeves. As previously mentioned, sharp metal is everywhere in automotive plants. Our Cut Protection page provides a tool to help you quickly find the right gloves based on specific cut scores. MCR Safety’s cut protection sorting tool. Click the image to start using! - Polyurethane-dipped Gloves\n80% of assemblers wear PU-dipped gloves.

Workers must pay close attention to what they’re doing, no matter what task is being\nsomeone is going to get hurt. In 1985, one Chicago parts manufacturing company had 41.8\ninjury cases per 100 full-time employees, roughly four\ntimes that of the industry. Well, that number has come down significantly over the years as better safety\nprocesses have been implemented, plant inspections have increased, and PPE technology has been worn. The parts manufacturing industry, NAICS 3363, experiences around 22% more injuries than the average for all\nindustries. However, when you peel the onion back on this industry, tne sub-industry today that should\nsafety and PPE rather seriously is the motor vehicle stamping industry. 6.3 injuries occur for every 100\nemployees, which is 36% higher than the average for all parts manufacturing sub-industries. It is 50%\nthan the 3.2 average for all U.S. industries.

Automobile frames are primarily metal, so arm, hand, and eye injuries are a constant concern, especially if incorrect PPE is worn. Since the assembly line remains the core place where automobile components come together and are assembled, many injuries occur there. Those who are responsible for assembling vehicles are exposed to harsh work conditions while performing a wide variety of repetitive tasks. They bolt, clip, place, and fasten thousands of parts together, all around sharp metal. Worker placing automobile parts with the 92743PU, a high-cut and high-dexterity glove. This blog focuses on automotive assembly PPE and production safety gear, specifically the gloves assemblers should wear. Safety in Automotive\nGood news – automotive injury rates have been coming down! According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), automotive manufacturing injury cases decreased from a rate of 10.2 per 100 full-time workers in 2003 to a rate of 5.6 per 100 full-time workers in 2010. While the decrease in on-the-job injury numbers is welcome news, the dangers still exist. And with the increase in production of new electrical vehicles, the continued decline in injury rates isn’t guaranteed. As one of the Big 3 automakers told us at a recent AISTech tradeshow, electric vehicles require more and more thinner gauged metal. With thinner gauged metals, workers need better hand dexterity and grip. We’ve got some new designs that will allow for increased dexterity and grip and we’ll cover those more in-depth below. This chart shows the incident rates of non-fatal injury cases found across all automotive-related sub-industries\nRecordable cases per 100 employees\nWe highlight each one of the above sub-industries in our central Automotive resource page. Assembly Employment Across the Automotive Industry\nIn 2016, there were 1,819,300 people employed as assemblers and fabricators in the United States across a variety of industries, including the automotive industry. Unfortunately, the BLS projects that the total number of assembler and fabricator jobs is going to decline 14% by 2026, owing to advances in automation. On a more positive note, the largest segment of workers found in automotive are those assembling the finished product. Let’s look at more specific numbers of assemblers and fabricators in a few automotive sub-industries. In 2017:\n- 165,650 people worked in the motor vehicle parts manufacturing sub-industry. - 141,150 people worked in the motor vehicle manufacturing sub-industry. - 60,580 people worked in the motor vehicle body and trailer manufacturing sub-industry. We cover many aspects of these automotive specialties below. For even more insight, the BLS provides a complete page for this type of worker. BLS Handbook for Assemblers\nThe Assembly Line\nAs we highlight on our Automotive industry page, the assembly line was pioneered in the U.S. by Henry Ford. His improved manufacturing process continues to be the industry standard in automotive manufacturing and a multitude of other industries. On an automotive assembly line, simultaneous work activities are taking place at several different stations along the line. When one station is finished with an assembly activity, the vehicle passes on to the next. By having multiple stations functioning at one time, a larger volume of vehicles is produced. Here are some of the different stages of assembly:\n- Hard Trim – fitting instrument panels and steering columns\n- Soft Trim and Final Assembly – where a majority of workers are found fitting seats, door pads, and upholstery\nThe journey doesn’t end there. Other stations along the line install the engine, petrol tank, exhaust, and bumpers. We lay out all the steps of the process on our Automotive Vehicle Manufacturing resource page. Click the image below to check out all 16 steps found in the manufacturing of vehicles. The automotive manufacturing process\nAssembly and Fabrication Activities\nAssemblers and fabricators assemble all the parts into one functioning, finished trailer or vehicle. To accomplish their job, they use power tools, machines, and their hands to bring parts into a finished product.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:2889d479-435f-4e9d-a1b9-0b942150337e>"]},{"passage":"Featured image by Vereshchagin Dmitry\nMost lift tables come with a ton of built-in safety features. For example, hydraulic lift tables come with solenoid valves that block oil flow, causing the table to stop in case the hydraulic system fails. Also, service locks that keep lift tables in place during servicing are standard. However, there are safety features that aren’t inherent, features that do not come as part of every pneumatic or hydraulic lift table. These are the safety features that you can request a manufacturer to add on to your lift table in order to create a safer working environment for your employees. Here are some of the top safety features you should consider asking for. Add Rails to a Lift Table\nYou can ask for rails to be added to a lift table. These rails can be as high as necessary to fit your specific needs. You can also ask for them to be extra fortified or to be at whatever angle you like. These rails will come in handy for keeping products or materials from tilting over or slipping when you are lowering or raising the table. This is especially so in cases when you are dealing with tall loads or loads that have to be stacked on top of each other. As a result, these rails will not only reduce the losses due to accidental damage but will also prevent accidental injuries to your employees\nRails on the lift table can also be used to provide extra support for workers. They can provide a place to hold onto when the table is in motion. Workers can also lean on them when working, allowing the table to serve as an ergonomic tool. Request Rugged Surfaces\nSince lift tables have different uses, standard lift tables do not have rugged surfaces. Some businesses even end up using them as lift-raise working platforms. However, if you use your lift table to raise loads or position workers, it is imperative that you insist on a grippy surface. This is because the extra grip from a rubberized or ruggedized surface will provide extra friction. This comes in handy in keeping the load in place when the table is in motion. Employees who use lift tables for positioning will also benefit from the extra friction. It will reduce the chances of slipping. And while workers are always advised to wipe off any moisture or oil spills as soon as they happen, mistakes can happen. In such cases, having a surface that has an extra grip can minimize the risk of accidental injuries. Customize Lift Tables with Safety Skirts\nSafety skirts are a great way to add a splash of style to your facility. This is because when you opt for a good manufacturer, like www.saxlift.com, your customization options are endless. You can choose whichever combination of colors you like. You can also have a say in the eventual shape of the safety skirts. However, they mainly serve as useful safety features. The alternating yellow and black folds that most businesses choose are visible to both the people operating the equipment and to other workers. With these colors, it is easy to see when the lift table is in motion, something that helps prevent accidents. Lift table safety skirts also prevent pieces of materials or even small products from getting into the moving parts of the lift table. This helps reduce the risks of mechanical failure. Furthermore, since the safety skirts can even be reinforced with steel rods, they can also keep the load from getting accidentally crushed. Workers can also benefit from having safety skirts installed on their lift tables. When used in conjunction with the anti-entrapment bar, safety skirts can become crucial in preventing horrific accidents that happen when workers’ limbs get trapped. RELATED ARTICLE: USING AND MAINTAINING INDUSTRIAL MACHINERY\nEnsure Workers Are Trained\nWhile requesting these additional safety features will help boost employee safety in your facility, they are not enough. These safety features are only effective when the machines are operated by people who are trained to operate them. Therefore, educating your employees on not only how to use the lift table but also what to do in case something goes wrong, is necessary if you want an accident-free work environment.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e29a4ed6-2bb3-4ca0-ba5a-2974b6fb6bca>"]},{"passage":"China Portable Wire Cutting Machine, Wire Rope Cutting\nChina Portable Wire Cutting Machine, Wire Rope Cutting Machine, Find details about China Cutting off Machine, Cutting Machine from Portable Wire Cutting Machine, Wire Rope Cutting Machine - Shandong Qifang Machinery Manufacturing Co., Ltd.\nHelp with finding tool to cut 1\/4\" Galvanized Steel\/Wire cable\nMight want to take a look at the wire rope and cable cutters made by HIT.

Often the hazard involves moving parts with the\npotential to cut, crush or draw-in body parts, although\nbarrier guards may also be necessary when electrical,\nthermal or chemical dangers are present. Guarding or protecting people from harm may be accomplished\nwith simple physical shielding of machine parts, or\nmore advanced techniques such as photo light curtains. It\nis also often necessary to employ interlocks to disable\npower to the machine when a guard has been removed. Accident risks can be reduced with adequate machine\nsafeguarding. Identifying obvious and hidden hazards\nshould be the first step in planning and reviewing the need\nfor machine tool safeguarding. Some hazards are subject\nto the ‘seven-foot rule, which dictates that these potentially\ndangerous operations be enclosed or guarded if they\nare located less than seven feet above the floor or platform\nlevel. Guards are required to have one-half-inch or\nsmaller openings. Blades and other overhead hazards—\nsuch as pulleys, belt rope and chain drives, overhead horizontal\nbelts, vertical and incline belts, gears, sprockets\nand chains—must comply with this rule. Most incidents leading to injury are the result of inadvertent\nor unwise contact with moving machine parts. Because\nof the great diversity of machine designs and functions,\nappropriate safeguarding to protect workers from such hazards\nmay also have numerous forms. Certain principles,\nhowever, are basic to any effective safeguarding design. Evaluation and Design\nA uniform process should be applied and used to evaluate\neach of the hazards on the machine to develop the required\nlevel of safeguarding. The evaluation can be performed by a\nknowledgeable and experienced person or, for more complicated\nmachine designs and safeguarding issues, the evaluation\ncan be conducted by a qualified third party. The OSHA\/ANSI hierarchy for controlling machine hazards\nis as follows:\nIf the results of the hazard evaluation show the equipment\nto be safe (that is, poses no hazard to the employee),\nchanges to the equipment may not be necessary. This\nmay be true for manually-powered equipment. - Eliminate the hazard by design\nControl the hazard by guarding or devices\n- Personal protective equipment\nAssessing the Risk: Many times the employer will want\nto know the answer to this question, “What do we fix\nfirst?” Once you have identified the danger areas (hazards),\nyou should assess the risk (how likely it is to cause\ninjury, and how severe the injury could be.) For every hazard that you identify on a machine, you\nmust then assign a risk factor to it. On the Probability\nchart listed below, decide what is the most predicable\ninjury that could occur, then assign a risk number to it. If you score a 1 or 2, do something NOW. If you score a 3 or 4, plan to do something soon. If you score a 5 or 6, plan to review the risk in the future. | CONSEQUENCE |\nHow severely could it hurt someone? | What is the likelihood of it happening? First aid only,\n|VERY LIKELY: |\n|VERY UNLIKELY: |\nIt could happen,\nWhen designing machine guards the safeguards must\nmeet these minimum general requirements:\nIn summary, employees working on or near machinery\nwith hazardous moving parts must be protected. OSHA\nrequires that such parts be guarded to ensure worker\nsafety. If unguarded, those parts could entangle a worker’s\nhands, hair or clothing and lead to injury or even death. Employers therefore should inspect equipment daily to\nmake sure that all guards are intact—especially after\nmaintenance or repair. - A guard is a protective device that PREVENTS anyone\nfrom reaching over, under, around or through the guard\nor guarding device. - An awareness barrier or chip shield can be used to\nwarn a person that they are coming in close proximity\nto a danger area. Other protective measures such as\ntraining or color coding must also be used so the person\nis reminded that they could potentially be injured if\nproper procedures are not followed. - Prevent contact: The safeguard must prevent hands,\narms, and any other part of the operator’s body from\nmaking contact with dangerous moving parts. A good\nsafeguarding system eliminates the possibility of the\noperator or another worker placing parts of their bodies\nnear hazardous moving parts.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:33cb5a5d-857b-4891-94cb-a8cf981285d7>"]}]}

We enjoyed the tour very much! This was a great tour. It helps you find everything in town you will want to go see later. Very informative and helpful. If you are staying in New Orleans for a while take this tour early. It was nice on a hot day to explore the city with ac. Our tour guide was awesome and I got to see a cemetary like I wanted. Definitely fun. The guid definitely knew his stuf....answered questions.....presented information in a very understandable manner. He was outstanding....no other way to say it. His driving was wonderful...and kept us all comfortable. Everything was great. Exactly what we expected. I am so happy I went on this tour. I didn't want to do the Cemetery Tour at first, but once the tour guide started talking I was impressed to learn its history, how the dead are buried above the ground, and how more than 2 bodies are in an only 2-body grave. The Garden District mansions\/homes are beautiful and the French Quarter is historic. Lastly, I learned a great deal about Katrina that media didn't report. It's a very sad tour but informative. My entire stay in NOLA was memorable. I highly recommend going on this tour. Gary gave us an excellent tour with great practical advicee for visiting the city. He was well versed in knowledge of many aspects of New Orleans and was entertaining. Just beware of the timings given in the tour descriptions. We were taken by surprise since the description said the tour would be 3 hours, but build in lots of extra time in case you need to be somewhere right after. Rhonda W USA\nThis was our first tour and a wonderful introduction to NO. The driver was informative and friendly. Our bus broke down and a replacement came fairly quickly. A very informative and interesting tour. A must when visiting New Orleans. Excellent tour guide. 100 recommendation. Guide Donna was fabulous. She truly enjoys sharing her city with visitors. We could have spent the entire day with her. Some content licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License. © 1997–Wed Sep 19 04:08:39 PDT 2018 Viator, Inc.

Arranging tours of the places and attractions that you want to see will help you to make the most of your experience in New Orleans. If you are traveling to New Orleans specifically for massive events like Mardi Gras or the Jazz and Heritage Festival, then you may already have your itinerary pretty well filled. If, however, you are traveling to the city in a non-peak time, you may want to begin looking into which tours are available. Many times you can even save money by booking certain tours along with your hotel accommodations. From New Orleans ghost tours to New Orleans walking tours there is something to peak just about everyone’s excitement in the Big Easy. Tours in New Orleans\nNew Orleans ghost tours are some of the most popular because of the enigmatic nature of the program—what will happen and will the tour actually see a ghost? The answer is that the New Orleans ghost tours are more theater than anything else, but do give tourists a glimpse inside the areas of the city which are claimed to be haunted and where ghost sightings are rumored to have taken place. Every evening from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., New Orleans ghost tours are moderated by master storytellers that take guests on walking tours of the French Quarter. You also have the option of taking one of the interesting cemetery tours that give you access to the European inspired and longstanding places of rest such as St. Louis Cemetery and more. New Orleans bike tours are another great way to check out the city and get to all of the attractions you are interested in seeing at your own speed. There are a variety of providers that offer a range of tours and services. One such provider offers New Orleans bike tours that last for three hours and take you around to some of the most significant historical sights, with the aim of giving riders some real insights into the composition of the city. Most of the New Orleans bike tours are meant to be fun as well as informative. You can choose from ones that take you to popular attractions like the cemeteries, French Market, Garden District, and more, or from journeys that cruise the most notable music venues, art galleries, and other such tailored experiences. Amongst New Orleans tours, those that take people deep into the swamp are also very popular. On the amazing New Orleans swamp tours you are whistled off into the bayou to witness not only authentic Cajun folk living in the swamp, but also a seemingly inexhaustible variety of wildlife. At a place like the Barataria Swamps and Wetlands, you will see a ton of alligators, and even have the chance of witnessing the majestic bald eagle. These are extremely popular New Orleans tours for photographers and lovers of nature who get unrivaled opportunities to snap shots of the gorgeous swamps. From New Orleans bike tours to the swamp to the cemeteries, there is something for everyone to see on their ideal tour in the Big Easy.\n\nBut take a little time to enjoy the peace, quite, and cryptids that the bayou has to offer. 3. Talk to the Locals\nWe went on tours every night, the entire week we were in NOLA. Some days, we did two per day. Each one was worth it, each guide with their own way of infusing their stories with their own personality. It brought the history to life. However, there was one that stuck with me in a more real way than the others. I wish I could remember the woman’s name. She was different from the other guides. There were no theatrics. There was no elaborate story telling or catchy moments created to make people gasp. We didn’t go to the main attractions. I don’t know if it was because my sister and I were the only people on that particular tour, or if it’s just the way she does things. Either way, she took us to places the other tours didn’t. She took us down quiet streets and along the river at sunset. She took us past her old house, and the home of a friend, and told us her personal ghost stories. She told us of her own experiences in this haunted city. When we go back, I plan to seek out more of that. I remember the first person who talked to us, other than the front desk people at the hotel. He was an exuberant man, sitting on the steps of a home somewhere between our hotel and Bourbon Street. I had my good camera around my neck, and he commented that I must be a photographer, and that I should take his picture. He said that HE was what New Orleans looked like; that he’d lived there his whole life. I took his picture, and we wished each other good days. Looking back, I’m sure he had some amazing stories. He probably could have told us where to find the best ghosts, if only I would have asked. 4. Avoid the Crowds\nI have a full time job in addition to this blog, other writing projects, and the Sister’s and Spirits podcast, so my sister and I went to NOLA when we were both able to get time off work, which happened to be the week of Memorial Day. It was busy. Much more crowded than either of us would have preferred. It was still an amazing trip, but we had to compete for the attention of the ghosts more so than what would have been ideal. It would be better to go when it’s quiet, when you could share the spaces with the spirits in a more intimate setting; when you could enjoy their company during a time that they’re not burnt out from hundreds of people trying to take their picture every day. Best to avoid the crowds of the living if you want to find the crowds of the dead. 5. Be Quite\nThis one is probably self-explanatory, but I’ll elaborate anyway because, well…that’s just who I am as a person. But also because New Orleans is not the type of place where ‘quiet’ comes naturally. In a place where activity is buzzing all around you, it can be hard to be still—to quiet your mind and your voice. It can be hard to draw your attention to a shadowy doorway when the homeless, the merchants, and the cat-callers are vying for your attention every few feet. It’s difficult to lift your eyes and gaze at a figure in a second story window when there are brilliant musicians and artists performing all around you. And how do you remember to sit quietly and scan the darkened corners of a bar for specters and spirits, when you only ducked in to evade a man, clearly under the influence of something not-quite-legal, who had been following you for the past two blocks? (true story)\nYes, it’s hard to be quite. Because New Orleans is not a quiet place. But surely it will be worth the effort when you catch a glimpse of something otherworldly, something unknown. And when you do catch that glimpse into the world of the paranormal, as so many have in a city well known for its hauntings and its vampires:\nLet me know where you were. Let me know what you saw. Did I miss anything? Or do you have a NOLA experience you’d like to share? Let me know in the comments.\n\nGet out!”—thus, he said while laughing at the results, spooking the group. Perhaps such antics will inspire a new generation of ghost hunters, modeled after guide Kalila Katherina Smith of Haunted History Tours and author of New Orleans Ghosts, Voodoo and Vampires (2010). Judging from her book and a nighttime tour I had with her, it appears such ghost-hunting raconteurs need very little evidence—perhaps only a thrice-told anecdote or a bit of pseudoscientific mumbo-jumbo—in order to spin their fantastic tales.

While I was sitting at Lafitte’s Blacksmith Shop, the oldest bar in the United States located on Bourbon Street in the French Quarters of New Orleans. The 18th-century architecture and the liquor aroused my fantasies of what it was like back in the day. How would the ladies and gents be dressed? What was their story? How could I learn more about those spirits, the ghost of New Orleans’s past?

Yet, one very intriguing aspect of New Orleans history is not often articulated, and that is the city’s vast array of ghost tours. Whether you believe in the supernatural or not, it is certain that there is something unnerving about pacing through historic cemeteries, meandering through former murderous establishments, and strutting along ghostly cobblestone streets. Below are listed some of the most captivating ghost tours in the city for those who are inclined to push their limits. With over three decades of experience, the reputable Witches Brew Tours boasts some of the most eerie, most haunting, and most interesting ghostly explorations in the metropolis. The guides themselves are incredibly talented and committed to their role. Although theatrical, their efforts help to make the tour a fully immersive experience that is not soon to be forgotten. While there is, to say the least, a number of ghost tour companies available in the city, I would be hard pressed to name one more worth your time than Witches Brew Tours. With a wealth of options available, the Haunted History\/Ghost Tour companies offers ghost, vampire, and cemetery tours for those looking to engage with potentially otherworldly spirits. The tour guides are immensely knowledgeable, providing haunting detail with every establishment and area visited. Additionally, it should be noted that when traveling through the French Quarter, tour participants will see the voodoo queen Marie Laveaux’s tomb, a vital part to any trip in the Big Easy. Always in competition with aforementioned Haunted History\/Ghost Tour, French Quarter Phantoms provides a nearly unparalleled haunting trip through time. Historically accurate, the tour is not only vastly entertaining but insightfully educational. Appropriate for all ages, the theatricality of this tour is diminished to a lesser degree than in others. In fact, the real fear comes at the hand of stone cold incontrovertible truth. To listen is to feel the transparent hand of the supernatural prickle your skin goosebump by goosebump. The next time you find yourself in the Crescent City, take advantage of these notably eerie supernatural awakenings. The green isn’t always greener on the other side; and it’s time you found that out for yourself.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:0241c846-6edb-447d-955b-62089928a4f1>"]},{"passage":"NEW ORLEANS GHOST TOUR – BEST NEW ORLEANS TOUR\nEnjoy a New Orleans tour by going on a New Orleans ghost tour!

If you are staying in New Orleans for a while take this tour early. It was nice on a hot day to explore the city with ac. Our tour guide was awesome and I got to see a cemetary like I wanted. Definitely fun. The guid definitely knew his stuf....answered questions.....presented information in a very understandable manner. He was outstanding....no other way to say it. His driving was wonderful...and kept us all comfortable. Everything was great. Exactly what we expected. I am so happy I went on this tour. I didn't want to do the Cemetery Tour at first, but once the tour guide started talking I was impressed to learn its history, how the dead are buried above the ground, and how more than 2 bodies are in an only 2-body grave. The Garden District mansions\/homes are beautiful and the French Quarter is historic. Lastly, I learned a great deal about Katrina that media didn't report. It's a very sad tour but informative. My entire stay in NOLA was memorable. I highly recommend going on this tour. Gary gave us an excellent tour with great practical advicee for visiting the city. He was well versed in knowledge of many aspects of New Orleans and was entertaining. Just beware of the timings given in the tour descriptions. We were taken by surprise since the description said the tour would be 3 hours, but build in lots of extra time in case you need to be somewhere right after. Rhonda W USA\nThis was our first tour and a wonderful introduction to NO. The driver was informative and friendly. Our bus broke down and a replacement came fairly quickly. A very informative and interesting tour. A must when visiting New Orleans. Excellent tour guide. 100 recommendation. Guide Donna was fabulous. She truly enjoys sharing her city with visitors. We could have spent the entire day with her. Some content licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License. © 1997–Wed Sep 19 04:08:39 PDT 2018 Viator, Inc.

Arranging tours of the places and attractions that you want to see will help you to make the most of your experience in New Orleans. If you are traveling to New Orleans specifically for massive events like Mardi Gras or the Jazz and Heritage Festival, then you may already have your itinerary pretty well filled. If, however, you are traveling to the city in a non-peak time, you may want to begin looking into which tours are available. Many times you can even save money by booking certain tours along with your hotel accommodations. From New Orleans ghost tours to New Orleans walking tours there is something to peak just about everyone’s excitement in the Big Easy. Tours in New Orleans\nNew Orleans ghost tours are some of the most popular because of the enigmatic nature of the program—what will happen and will the tour actually see a ghost? The answer is that the New Orleans ghost tours are more theater than anything else, but do give tourists a glimpse inside the areas of the city which are claimed to be haunted and where ghost sightings are rumored to have taken place. Every evening from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., New Orleans ghost tours are moderated by master storytellers that take guests on walking tours of the French Quarter. You also have the option of taking one of the interesting cemetery tours that give you access to the European inspired and longstanding places of rest such as St. Louis Cemetery and more. New Orleans bike tours are another great way to check out the city and get to all of the attractions you are interested in seeing at your own speed. There are a variety of providers that offer a range of tours and services. One such provider offers New Orleans bike tours that last for three hours and take you around to some of the most significant historical sights, with the aim of giving riders some real insights into the composition of the city. Most of the New Orleans bike tours are meant to be fun as well as informative. You can choose from ones that take you to popular attractions like the cemeteries, French Market, Garden District, and more, or from journeys that cruise the most notable music venues, art galleries, and other such tailored experiences. Amongst New Orleans tours, those that take people deep into the swamp are also very popular. On the amazing New Orleans swamp tours you are whistled off into the bayou to witness not only authentic Cajun folk living in the swamp, but also a seemingly inexhaustible variety of wildlife. At a place like the Barataria Swamps and Wetlands, you will see a ton of alligators, and even have the chance of witnessing the majestic bald eagle. These are extremely popular New Orleans tours for photographers and lovers of nature who get unrivaled opportunities to snap shots of the gorgeous swamps. From New Orleans bike tours to the swamp to the cemeteries, there is something for everyone to see on their ideal tour in the Big Easy.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ef455bdc-415c-45c2-81f7-7b05e4f715e4>"]},{"passage":"But take a little time to enjoy the peace, quite, and cryptids that the bayou has to offer. 3. Talk to the Locals\nWe went on tours every night, the entire week we were in NOLA. Some days, we did two per day. Each one was worth it, each guide with their own way of infusing their stories with their own personality. It brought the history to life. However, there was one that stuck with me in a more real way than the others. I wish I could remember the woman’s name. She was different from the other guides. There were no theatrics. There was no elaborate story telling or catchy moments created to make people gasp. We didn’t go to the main attractions. I don’t know if it was because my sister and I were the only people on that particular tour, or if it’s just the way she does things. Either way, she took us to places the other tours didn’t. She took us down quiet streets and along the river at sunset. She took us past her old house, and the home of a friend, and told us her personal ghost stories. She told us of her own experiences in this haunted city. When we go back, I plan to seek out more of that. I remember the first person who talked to us, other than the front desk people at the hotel. He was an exuberant man, sitting on the steps of a home somewhere between our hotel and Bourbon Street. I had my good camera around my neck, and he commented that I must be a photographer, and that I should take his picture. He said that HE was what New Orleans looked like; that he’d lived there his whole life. I took his picture, and we wished each other good days. Looking back, I’m sure he had some amazing stories. He probably could have told us where to find the best ghosts, if only I would have asked. 4. Avoid the Crowds\nI have a full time job in addition to this blog, other writing projects, and the Sister’s and Spirits podcast, so my sister and I went to NOLA when we were both able to get time off work, which happened to be the week of Memorial Day. It was busy. Much more crowded than either of us would have preferred. It was still an amazing trip, but we had to compete for the attention of the ghosts more so than what would have been ideal. It would be better to go when it’s quiet, when you could share the spaces with the spirits in a more intimate setting; when you could enjoy their company during a time that they’re not burnt out from hundreds of people trying to take their picture every day. Best to avoid the crowds of the living if you want to find the crowds of the dead. 5. Be Quite\nThis one is probably self-explanatory, but I’ll elaborate anyway because, well…that’s just who I am as a person. But also because New Orleans is not the type of place where ‘quiet’ comes naturally. In a place where activity is buzzing all around you, it can be hard to be still—to quiet your mind and your voice. It can be hard to draw your attention to a shadowy doorway when the homeless, the merchants, and the cat-callers are vying for your attention every few feet. It’s difficult to lift your eyes and gaze at a figure in a second story window when there are brilliant musicians and artists performing all around you. And how do you remember to sit quietly and scan the darkened corners of a bar for specters and spirits, when you only ducked in to evade a man, clearly under the influence of something not-quite-legal, who had been following you for the past two blocks? (true story)\nYes, it’s hard to be quite. Because New Orleans is not a quiet place. But surely it will be worth the effort when you catch a glimpse of something otherworldly, something unknown. And when you do catch that glimpse into the world of the paranormal, as so many have in a city well known for its hauntings and its vampires:\nLet me know where you were. Let me know what you saw. Did I miss anything? Or do you have a NOLA experience you’d like to share? Let me know in the comments.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:d337388e-e519-4e78-b849-bec4fec03908>"]},{"passage":"Get out!”—thus, he said while laughing at the results, spooking the group. Perhaps such antics will inspire a new generation of ghost hunters, modeled after guide Kalila Katherina Smith of Haunted History Tours and author of New Orleans Ghosts, Voodoo and Vampires (2010). Judging from her book and a nighttime tour I had with her, it appears such ghost-hunting raconteurs need very little evidence—perhaps only a thrice-told anecdote or a bit of pseudoscientific mumbo-jumbo—in order to spin their fantastic tales.

While I was sitting at Lafitte’s Blacksmith Shop, the oldest bar in the United States located on Bourbon Street in the French Quarters of New Orleans. The 18th-century architecture and the liquor aroused my fantasies of what it was like back in the day. How would the ladies and gents be dressed? What was their story? How could I learn more about those spirits, the ghost of New Orleans’s past? I checked TripAdvisor on my phone for Ghost Tours in New Orleans and that’s where I found a really good deal: The New Orleans Ghost, Voodoo and Vampire Tour. Spooky! There I was sitting at Lafitte’s Blacksmith Shop and I found the perfect ghost tour in New Orleans. That particular New Orleans haunted tour was going to tell me more about Lafitte’s Blacksmith shop. The spirits were working on me in more ways than one. I considered it a sign and I registered to take the ghost tour of New Orleans adventure. Spoil alert, I’m not going to tell you all about the ghost tour…\nbut sightings have it that there is a tall man with long, dark hair seen standing in a back room at Lafitte’s Blacksmith Shop. The haunted tour history of that place is rich and you’ll learn about Caribbean pirates, Andrew Jackson, and the battle of New Orleans. You’ve got to take this New Orleans ghost tour. Another scary detail involves Lafitte’s guest house and a little girl seen by visitors in a mirror. It’s freaky! It’ll make you afraid of things that go bump in the night. The ghost tour guides explain in detail how and why it happens. You don’t want to miss that New Orleans ghost tour story either. Warning, mirrors in New Orleans can be creepy. Believe me, I had so much fun and enjoyed my visit so much more because I took the ghost tour in New Orleans. It’s family friendly and the Witches Brew ghost tour guides are the best in the business.

An earlier post – this one – explains why I was looking at this particular set of films. When I first started this new blog, I wrote a post outlining where I was up to with my ‘otro cine español’ project but not much has happened since (although if you click on the ‘otro cine español’ tag at the foot of this post, you will be able to see other connected pieces). My trip to the D’A Festival in April 2015 mainly stemmed from a realisation that if I wanted to see these films (and their newer incarnations), then I would need to travel to festivals because it is difficult to cross paths with them otherwise. But I’ve had to accept that I don’t currently have the resources for festival trips, and have put the project to one side for the time being – although I keep an eye on the various Spanish online platforms that might host such films. For now, this piece and the one written specifically for this blog are a summation of the project. I haven’t attempted to update the main part of the text (I haven’t stayed up to date with the saga of Spanish film finance, although I don’t expect that the situation has improved at all – if anything, it’s likely to have got worse) but I am rejigging the postscript because the availability status of several of the films has changed (so that info is current as of August 2017). Un impulso colectivo\nMarginal cinemas – or cinema being made on the margins, outside the norms of a given industrial context – are nearly always present, if not always widely visible. In the past few years in Spain, specific actions by the Rajoy government (for example, dismantling the existing film finance infrastructure without putting anything in its place, and in September 2012 raising the IVA [VAT] on entertainment (including cinema tickets) from 8% to 21%), in combination with the dire economic situation, have thrown film production in Spain into disarray and further undermined confidence in the Spanish film industry – an industry that was already habitually said to be in near-perpetual crisis. These circumstances have exacerbated the financial precariousness of those filmmakers already operating on the margins; the current reliance on self-funding and \/ or crowdfunding is not sustainable in the long term, and nor does it afford people a secure way of making a living. At the same time, the visibility of these films on the margins has increased because their success at film festivals abroad has raised their profiles at home. This international recognition is often presented by the press as a fillip for a beleaguered industry that these filmmakers nonetheless remain outside of. From an outsider’s perspective (i.e. mine), there seem to be two events that crystallised the growing attention directed at goings-on on the margins: the September 2013 issue of Caimán Cuadernos de Cine, which was dedicated to ‘el otro cine español’ (the first time I had seen these films presented as being related to each other, despite their disparities), and the ‘Un impulso colectivo’ [A Collective Impulse] section (which takes its name from programmer Carlos Losilla’s Caimán article) at the D’A – Festival Internacional de Cinema D’Autor de Barcelona in April 2014. That’s not to say that these types of films weren’t being supported and championed elsewhere – many screened abroad and \/ or at festivals such as San Sebastián and Seville prior to these two events – but Caimán and the D’A Festival drew attention to the films and filmmakers as a group in a way that seems important to me because cinema is not created in a vacuum, and the idea of a group (however nebulous) foregrounds that these films are not isolated or unrelated occurrences. A brief outline of each of the 14 films in ‘Un impulso colectivo’ can be found here. In this post I am going to consider the films as a group in order to highlight some areas of commonality across the programme. Form follows content –\nThe ‘Un impulso colectivo’ programme offered a panorama of marginal cinema(s) in Spain, encompassing a range of financial models (including self-financing, crowdfunding, local grants and subsidies) and diverse genres and styles (a deadpan sci-fi, a musical-comedy, essay films, documentaries, and social dramas among them).\n\nHow did you get interested in filmmaking? By going to the pictures. I was very impressed particularly by a film called Goliath and the Dragon, because there was a dinosaur in it, by Ray Harryhausen films, and by the original King Kong. If there was a dinosaur in it, I was there. In your Revengers Tragedy diary, you mention taking footage for use in future mini-DV movies. Can you tell me more about these movies? Are they hobbies, home movies or just for fun? That was probably footage for the additional DVD elements. The producers and I had a feeling while we were in production that the financiers or DVD distributors would want more than a half-hour \"making of.\" So we rustled up a small crew, and later, I concocted half a dozen small films around the making of Revengers. They're on the American and the Japanese DVDs, though strangely not the British one. Are there plans to release the film theatrically or on DVD in mainland Europe? The film has played theatrically in the UK and at festivals in Locarno, Cork, and Bruxelles. It was rejected by the Berlin Festival. I don't know what other European sales on DVD or film there might be. You have mentioned several times your admiration for Buñuel and Kurosawa. What are your personal favorite films by each of them? My favorite Buñuel films are El Ángel exterminador, El and L'Age D'Or. My favorite Kurosawas are Seven Samurai, Ikiru and Madadayo. Do you see any similarities in their work? I don't see any similarities at all! What other films or filmmakers do you admire or have influenced your work? I like very much the work of Francesco Rosi, especially The Mattei Affair, and the Russian film Idi y smotri (Come and See), Corbucci's Il Grande Silenzio (The Great Silence), and Leone's For a Few Dollars More. Of American directors, my favorites are Welles, Peckinpah, Huston, Hellman andAldrich. Everything I've seen has probably had some impact on my stuff, unless it was instantly forgotten. Any current films or filmmakers you admire? The only film I've seen recently that impressed me was Gus Van Sant's Elephant. Music has always played an important role in your films, from the classic soundtracks of Repo Man and Straight to Hell to Chumbawamba scoring your Revengers Tragedy. How do you go about choosing the music for your films? Does music ever come first? That is to say, are characters, scenes or dialog ever shaped by the music you want to use? Music was influential in advance in Sid & Nancy, where sequences are constructed around specific songs, and Walker, where Rudy wrote that Walker's men depart the burning cathedral singing \"Onward Christian Soldiers.\" The main theme for Straight to Hell was composed before the film was made, and it was nice to listen to it out there on a desert evening. But I don't think it made any difference to the film. Whereas some of the songs that arose spontaneously in Straight to Hell - \"Danny Boy,\" the \"Hardware Man's Love Song\" and the \"Weiner Song\" - were very significant. Do you play music yourself? No, I have no musical talents. But I like listening to it. What are some of your current favorites? My favorite bands are the Beatles and the Clash. So you know how old I am. I am also very keen on Chumbawamba, Space, Pete Wylie aka The Mighty Wah!, and when I'm in the mood for film soundtracks, Morricone and Pray For Rain. Yorkie of Space has a massive collection of solo material and I have been enjoying that of late. How did it come about that you lived in Mexico City? I lived in Mexico City because it was the capital of the Mexican film industry - the last two studios were there, as was the editing, camera and sound equipment. So even if you shot in Durango, or Zacatecas, the base was Mexico City. I love the Distrito Federal very much. It has a great Metro system, great steam baths, a superb museum of Mexican art - including landscapes by Jose Maria Velasco - the Museo Nacional. And I made many friends there. If I must be based in a city, Mexico is the city I would prefer. You have made films in several countries.\n\nI've written a script and plan to film it pretty soon, starting later this month and hopefully ending in early july. It should be finished completely around mid august. Last night I went to this talk to see this pretty well known film critic Mark Kermode talk about the future of film criticism and, at the signing I asked him a question: if i sent him my finished film, could he do a mini review of it on this uncut podcast he does on his channel. He told me that it would unlikely unless it was playing on some short film circuit, but if it was and i reminded him of who i am, there's a chance he could do somethin about it. of course he probably wouldn't if the film was shit but, if its was possibly quality, there's a chance. so i'm 16 and the short film will probably be around 40-50 minutes long. i live in the uk, in oxford. as for the genre of the film, i'm not too sure how to categorize it. hopefully, if it all goes technically right, i can see it turning out to be something like mullholand drive with hints of 2001 and PDL. but then again i hope it's more of its own thing. It'll be finished by around mid-august and i'll post it here when its done no matter what. Does anyone have any recommendations for a short film circuit that i could put it on, based on my age\/the length of the film\/the genre\/where i live so that i could promote it somehow? Also, if you know of Mark Kermode, do you know which circuits or festivals he looks out for? For an aspiring young filmmaker, it would useful to have someone like him (HOPEFULLY, if it turns out to be quality) promote me and act as a foothold in the industry.\n\nFor example since I decided to make this film as observational as possible therefore I had to spend a lot of time (almost live with the subjects of the film) and see what was happening in their lives. That demanded a lot personal life sacrificing which I did for the sake of capturing the story. Please tell me about the technical side of the film; your relation to the film’s cinematographer, what the film was shot on and why it was decided to be photographed this way. The style of the film was observational. I’ve done the camera work and sound because of the nature of this film (being observational) and the unknown duration of the production I decided to conduct the filming sessions by my self. I became a fly on the wall and as I said on above I almost lived with them. Talk a bit about the experiences (festival or non-festival) that you have had with this particular film. Have you had any interesting audience stories or questions that have arisen at screenings? Many prestige film festivals around the world have received this film very well. During the last 9 months this film has gone to more that 25film festivals. The highlight of them were IDFA, Tribeca, Singapore, Goteborg and of course VIFF. There are so many interesting stories happened and so many audience have express their opinions and we had so many very interesting in the Q & A during the last few months while I’ve toured with this film. I could say easily that ninety nine percent of the time the audiences become so interested in the film that after almost two hours screening of the film they would stay back and want to ask a lot questions about the film and the characters. This has been an exciting experience for me to meet my film’s audience and learn more about what they think of the film. Who would you say your biggest inspirations are in the film world (directors, actors, cinematographers, etc)? Did you have any direct inspirations from filmmakers for this film in particular? There are few people who I normally look up at their works. This list is long but if I want to drop few names they would be Master Abas Kiarostrami from Iran, and David Caesar from Australia. How far do you think you would want to go in this industry? Do you see yourself working on larger stories for a larger budget under the studio system, or do you feel that you would like to continue down the independent film path? This is a very difficult question to answer since the industry has been changing so rapidly during the last decade and therefore the sources as well as method of funding have changed too. If you weren’t in this profession, what other career do you think you would be interested in? I would probably would have been working with NGOs and UN in Educational areas. Do you think that you have “made it” in this profession yet? If you don’t believe so, what do you think would happen for that moment to occur? I don’t think there is such thing for me to say that “I made it “since I look at my courier from different angles. I have achieved many of my goals but there are many more to achieve in the future. How important do you think the critical\/media response is to film these days, be it a large production, independent film or festival title? The media’s response to film is very important. What would you say to someone on the street to see your film instead of the latest blockbuster playing at the local megaplex? Good on you Mate! No doubt there are a lot of aspiring filmmakers at film festivals who are out there curious about making a film of their own. Do you have any advice that you could provide for those looking to get a start? Filmmaking is very affordable craft these days especially for those who are new in this industry! What they need is just a good story and clear vision. The rest comes with it! And finally…what is your all time favorite motion picture, and why? There are many! I can’t even give you a list since it’s going to be really long! This is one of the many films screening at this year’s Vancouver International Film Festival.

In this post I am going to consider the films as a group in order to highlight some areas of commonality across the programme. Form follows content –\nThe ‘Un impulso colectivo’ programme offered a panorama of marginal cinema(s) in Spain, encompassing a range of financial models (including self-financing, crowdfunding, local grants and subsidies) and diverse genres and styles (a deadpan sci-fi, a musical-comedy, essay films, documentaries, and social dramas among them).","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:8d038da1-775f-4af5-8e45-945e99ded6e6>"]},{"passage":"How did you get interested in filmmaking? By going to the pictures. I was very impressed particularly by a film called Goliath and the Dragon, because there was a dinosaur in it, by Ray Harryhausen films, and by the original King Kong. If there was a dinosaur in it, I was there. In your Revengers Tragedy diary, you mention taking footage for use in future mini-DV movies. Can you tell me more about these movies? Are they hobbies, home movies or just for fun? That was probably footage for the additional DVD elements. The producers and I had a feeling while we were in production that the financiers or DVD distributors would want more than a half-hour \"making of.\" So we rustled up a small crew, and later, I concocted half a dozen small films around the making of Revengers. They're on the American and the Japanese DVDs, though strangely not the British one. Are there plans to release the film theatrically or on DVD in mainland Europe? The film has played theatrically in the UK and at festivals in Locarno, Cork, and Bruxelles. It was rejected by the Berlin Festival. I don't know what other European sales on DVD or film there might be. You have mentioned several times your admiration for Buñuel and Kurosawa. What are your personal favorite films by each of them? My favorite Buñuel films are El Ángel exterminador, El and L'Age D'Or. My favorite Kurosawas are Seven Samurai, Ikiru and Madadayo. Do you see any similarities in their work? I don't see any similarities at all! What other films or filmmakers do you admire or have influenced your work? I like very much the work of Francesco Rosi, especially The Mattei Affair, and the Russian film Idi y smotri (Come and See), Corbucci's Il Grande Silenzio (The Great Silence), and Leone's For a Few Dollars More. Of American directors, my favorites are Welles, Peckinpah, Huston, Hellman andAldrich. Everything I've seen has probably had some impact on my stuff, unless it was instantly forgotten. Any current films or filmmakers you admire? The only film I've seen recently that impressed me was Gus Van Sant's Elephant. Music has always played an important role in your films, from the classic soundtracks of Repo Man and Straight to Hell to Chumbawamba scoring your Revengers Tragedy. How do you go about choosing the music for your films? Does music ever come first? That is to say, are characters, scenes or dialog ever shaped by the music you want to use? Music was influential in advance in Sid & Nancy, where sequences are constructed around specific songs, and Walker, where Rudy wrote that Walker's men depart the burning cathedral singing \"Onward Christian Soldiers.\" The main theme for Straight to Hell was composed before the film was made, and it was nice to listen to it out there on a desert evening. But I don't think it made any difference to the film. Whereas some of the songs that arose spontaneously in Straight to Hell - \"Danny Boy,\" the \"Hardware Man's Love Song\" and the \"Weiner Song\" - were very significant. Do you play music yourself? No, I have no musical talents. But I like listening to it. What are some of your current favorites? My favorite bands are the Beatles and the Clash. So you know how old I am. I am also very keen on Chumbawamba, Space, Pete Wylie aka The Mighty Wah!, and when I'm in the mood for film soundtracks, Morricone and Pray For Rain. Yorkie of Space has a massive collection of solo material and I have been enjoying that of late. How did it come about that you lived in Mexico City? I lived in Mexico City because it was the capital of the Mexican film industry - the last two studios were there, as was the editing, camera and sound equipment. So even if you shot in Durango, or Zacatecas, the base was Mexico City. I love the Distrito Federal very much. It has a great Metro system, great steam baths, a superb museum of Mexican art - including landscapes by Jose Maria Velasco - the Museo Nacional. And I made many friends there. If I must be based in a city, Mexico is the city I would prefer. You have made films in several countries.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:387bb762-3aba-4518-a585-f4834a1b5a14>"]},{"passage":"I've written a script and plan to film it pretty soon, starting later this month and hopefully ending in early july. It should be finished completely around mid august. Last night I went to this talk to see this pretty well known film critic Mark Kermode talk about the future of film criticism and, at the signing I asked him a question: if i sent him my finished film, could he do a mini review of it on this uncut podcast he does on his channel. He told me that it would unlikely unless it was playing on some short film circuit, but if it was and i reminded him of who i am, there's a chance he could do somethin about it. of course he probably wouldn't if the film was shit but, if its was possibly quality, there's a chance. so i'm 16 and the short film will probably be around 40-50 minutes long. i live in the uk, in oxford. as for the genre of the film, i'm not too sure how to categorize it. hopefully, if it all goes technically right, i can see it turning out to be something like mullholand drive with hints of 2001 and PDL. but then again i hope it's more of its own thing. It'll be finished by around mid-august and i'll post it here when its done no matter what. Does anyone have any recommendations for a short film circuit that i could put it on, based on my age\/the length of the film\/the genre\/where i live so that i could promote it somehow? Also, if you know of Mark Kermode, do you know which circuits or festivals he looks out for? For an aspiring young filmmaker, it would useful to have someone like him (HOPEFULLY, if it turns out to be quality) promote me and act as a foothold in the industry.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:660781f4-2026-4753-996f-577727eb0411>"]},{"passage":"For example since I decided to make this film as observational as possible therefore I had to spend a lot of time (almost live with the subjects of the film) and see what was happening in their lives. That demanded a lot personal life sacrificing which I did for the sake of capturing the story. Please tell me about the technical side of the film; your relation to the film’s cinematographer, what the film was shot on and why it was decided to be photographed this way. The style of the film was observational. I’ve done the camera work and sound because of the nature of this film (being observational) and the unknown duration of the production I decided to conduct the filming sessions by my self. I became a fly on the wall and as I said on above I almost lived with them. Talk a bit about the experiences (festival or non-festival) that you have had with this particular film. Have you had any interesting audience stories or questions that have arisen at screenings? Many prestige film festivals around the world have received this film very well. During the last 9 months this film has gone to more that 25film festivals. The highlight of them were IDFA, Tribeca, Singapore, Goteborg and of course VIFF. There are so many interesting stories happened and so many audience have express their opinions and we had so many very interesting in the Q & A during the last few months while I’ve toured with this film. I could say easily that ninety nine percent of the time the audiences become so interested in the film that after almost two hours screening of the film they would stay back and want to ask a lot questions about the film and the characters. This has been an exciting experience for me to meet my film’s audience and learn more about what they think of the film. Who would you say your biggest inspirations are in the film world (directors, actors, cinematographers, etc)? Did you have any direct inspirations from filmmakers for this film in particular? There are few people who I normally look up at their works. This list is long but if I want to drop few names they would be Master Abas Kiarostrami from Iran, and David Caesar from Australia. How far do you think you would want to go in this industry? Do you see yourself working on larger stories for a larger budget under the studio system, or do you feel that you would like to continue down the independent film path? This is a very difficult question to answer since the industry has been changing so rapidly during the last decade and therefore the sources as well as method of funding have changed too. If you weren’t in this profession, what other career do you think you would be interested in? I would probably would have been working with NGOs and UN in Educational areas. Do you think that you have “made it” in this profession yet? If you don’t believe so, what do you think would happen for that moment to occur? I don’t think there is such thing for me to say that “I made it “since I look at my courier from different angles. I have achieved many of my goals but there are many more to achieve in the future. How important do you think the critical\/media response is to film these days, be it a large production, independent film or festival title? The media’s response to film is very important. What would you say to someone on the street to see your film instead of the latest blockbuster playing at the local megaplex? Good on you Mate! No doubt there are a lot of aspiring filmmakers at film festivals who are out there curious about making a film of their own. Do you have any advice that you could provide for those looking to get a start? Filmmaking is very affordable craft these days especially for those who are new in this industry! What they need is just a good story and clear vision. The rest comes with it! And finally…what is your all time favorite motion picture, and why? There are many! I can’t even give you a list since it’s going to be really long! This is one of the many films screening at this year’s Vancouver International Film Festival.

Warning: Unlike other Arduino boards, the Arduino Due board runs at 3.3V. The maximum voltage that the I\/O pins can tolerate is 3.3V. Providing higher voltages, like 5V to an I\/O pin could damage the board. If you are looking to interface 5V based product to the due we recommend using the Adafruit 8 channel bi-directional level converter.

It has 54 digital input\/output pins (of which 12 can be used as PWM outputs), 12 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 84 MHz clock, an USB OTG capable connection, 2 DAC (digital to analog), 2 TWI, CAN bus, a power jack, an SPI header, a JTAG header, a reset button and an erase button. If you're curious to what the erase button does well it.....hmmm....how can we put this?....it swiftly eliminates the sketch you've uploaded to it....and in other terms: it erases your sketch. The board contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a micro-USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. The Due is compatible with Arduino shields that work at 3.3V and are compliant with the 1.0 Arduino pinout.

The Cortex-M3 processor is a 32-bit processor, with a 32-bit wide data path, register bank, and memory interface. A total of 13 general-purpose registers, two stack pointers, a link register, a program counter, and a number of special registers, including a program status register, are available. The Arm Cortex-M3 is a microcontroller. The 32-bit Arm Cortex-M3 core microcontroller is designed for high-performance, real-time processing in cost-constrained applications and can handle complex tasks. Any Arm Cortex-M3 microcontroller offers high scalability combined with an optimal trade-off between performance and cost. The Due can be powered either by USB or by an external power supply. The power source is automatically selected. An AC-to-DC adapter (wall-wart) or a battery can provide external (non-USB) power. A 2.1mm center-positive plug can be plugged into the board's power jack to connect the adapter. The speed of the processor for the due board is much faster compared to the mega board. The processor used in the due board is considered the fastest processor compared to other boards. The other difference between the due board and the mega board is the size of the memory.\n\nStep 1: What is Arduino? Arduino boards are open-source electronics platform that can be used to easily interface with hardware and sensors to expand the possibilities of your project. Arduino started in Italy in 2005. It has expanded over the years, with multiple manufacturers and distributors around the world. Arduino also has the Arduino IDE, the software that you use to program the board. The Arduino is a great educational tool to learn the basics of coding and electronics. There are lots of boards, starter kits, and shields to ensure that whatever your project is, you can find the parts for it. Arduino is simple enough that beginners can dive in easily, yet has enough options that advanced users can use it as well. The Arduino software can be used with any Windows, Linux or Mac computer. See the Official Arduino Introduction for a more in depth overview of the board. You can also see the Arduino Foundations page to get an idea of what’s involved in Arduino programming. Step 2: Which board do I use? Through the years, there have been many revisions of the Arduino board. We will go over a few key differences between the boards. You can see a full overview of all the Arduino products here: www.arduino.cc\/en\/Main\/Products\nThese boards are good for getting started with, and good for basic programming. Arduino Uno – Get it now! This is the basic beginners board. It has 14 digital input\/outputs (6 of which can be PWM pins), 6 analog inputs, and a 16MHz clock. This allows it to interface with a variety of sensors and applications. The Uno operates at 5V, and can be powered via the USB port, or it can take an input voltage of 6-20V (7-12 recommended) on the Vin pin. The 5V pin can supply 1A max for powering external sensors and outputs, if more then that is required you need an external power supply. If you try to draw more then 1A, the board will be damaged. The Arduino Uno measures 2.7″ by 2.1″. Arduino Micro – Get it now! The Arduino Micro is a small control board for when space is at a premium in your project. It measures 0.7″ by 1.9″. The Arduino Micro has many of the same specifications as the Uno, with a few differences. The Micro has 20 digital input\/output pins. 7 can be used as PWM pins, 12 as analog inputs. The serial communication with the computer is done differently, see the Arduino Leonardo board for more details. Arduino Pro\/Pro Micro\nThe Arduino Pro is a board with a few different versions. The Pro is a full sized board, compatible with the various shields. The Pro Mini measures 0.7″ by 1.3″, which makes it perfect for small projects. Each board comes in a 5V and 3.3V version. There are no headers attached to the board, which makes it slightly harder to use for prototyping, but gives it more flexibility when you are soldering the board into your project. The Arduino Pro has many of the same specifications as the Uno, with a few differences.The 3.3V version runs on a 8MHz clock, the 5V has a 16MHz clock. For power input, you need 3.3-12V for the 3.3V board, and 5-12V for the 5V board. The Arduino Nano is used for when you want the size of an Arduino Micro, but the functionality of an Uno. It has 14 digital input\/output pins (6 can be PWM), 8 analog inputs, and a 16MHz clock. It runs on 5V, taking an input power voltage of 7-12V. It measures 0.73″ x 1.7″. More Advanced Boards:\nThese boards have more advanced features for your next level projects. Arduino Mega – Get it now! The Arduino Mega is used for projects with tons of inputs and outputs. All the specs are the same as the Arduino Uno, but it has 54 digital inputs\/outputs (14 can be PWM), 16 analog inputs, and 4 UARTs for serial communication. It measures 2.1″ by 4″. Arduino Leonardo – Get it now! The Arduino Leonardo has the same specifications as the Arduino Micro. The big difference between the Leonardo\/Micro and all the other boards, is that there is no external chip for USB programming. Everything is built in to one controller. This allows these boards to be connected through a “Virtual COM port”, and allows the Leonardo\/Micro to communicate as a keyboard\/mouse to the computer. This also means that unlike the other boards, there is no reset when the serial port is opened.\n\nBest hardware solutions for Andruino project\nArduino Mega 2560\nThe Arduino Mega 2560 is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega2560. It has 54 digital input\/output pins (of which 15 can be used as PWM outputs), 16 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. - PINS (PIN mapping)\n- Operating Voltage 5V\n- Input Voltage (recommended) 7-12V\n- Input Voltage (limit) 6-20V\n- Digital I\/O Pins 54 (of which 15 provide PWM output)\n- Analog Input Pins 16\n- DC Current per I\/O Pin 20 mA\n- DC Current for 3.3V Pin 50 mA\n- Flash Memory 256 KB of which 8 KB used by bootloader\n- SRAM 8 KB\n- EEPROM 4 KB\n- Clock Speed 16 MHz\n- Internet connectivity (external shield)\n- Wifi with ESP8266 (UART)\n- Cable ethernet with Arduino Shield W5100\/W5200 (SPI interface)\nDocumentation link: Arduino MEGA\nNode MCU\/ESP8266 12-E\nNodeMCU is an open source IoT platform including a firmware which runs on the ESP8266 with the Espressif Non-OS SDK, and hardware based on the ESP-12 module.

Arduino Due – Get it now! The Arduino Due is the biggest and baddest of the boards. The most crucial difference between this board and the others is that it runs at 3.3V, not 5V. This means that you may need external circuitry to interface this with regular 5V sensors. You can still input 7-12V, but the input\/output pins require 3.3V. The Arduino Due is the size of a Mega, 2.1″ by 4″. It has 54 digital inputs\/outputs (12 can be PWM), 12 analog inputs, and 4 UARTs for serial communication. It runs on a 32 bit processor, running at 84MHz. This allows it to do bigger calculations (4 bytes at a time, rather then 2), over 5 times faster then the other Arduino boards. This makes the programs run up to 10x faster. The Due also has an unlimited number of interrupt pins, due to the second processor, allowing it to get even more feedback from the world around it. Arduino Ethernet – Get it now! The Arduino Ethernet board is like a Arduino Uno with an Ethernet shield built into it. There is also a micro SD card reader built in. It has the same number of inputs\/outputs as the Uno, but 4 are used for communication with the Ethernet system, and 4 are used for the SD reader. This leaves 6 available digital input\/outputs (4 can be PWM), and 6 analog inputs. By using the ethernet port, you can connect this board to the internet to open a whole new world of possibilities for your projects. The Arduino Yun is a very special board. First, is a combination of two processors. One processor runs the Arduino programs, and the other processor runs a Linux distribution that allows you to write shell and python scripts. Second, it has built in WiFi and Ethernet capabilities, to make it easy to connect your projects to the internet. Finally, it has a built in SD card reader to expand the storage space of your programs. The Yun has 20 digital input\/output pins (7 can be PWM), 12 analog inputs, and a 16MHz clock. It measures 2.09″ by 2.87″. Now that we’ve gone over all the Arduino boards, it’s time to move on to setting up the software! Step 3: Software Setup\nOnce you’ve picked your board, you need to install all the software and drivers so that you can start programming! Arduino has written the best getting started guide, see here for the various instructions for each board. Once all the drivers and the Arduino IDE is installed, you can begin programming. Before you can upload code, ensure that the correct board and port is selected. On the top menus, go to “Tools” – “Board”, and choose which board you are using. Then, go to “Tools” – “Port” and choose the port that corresponds to your Arduino. The getting started guide that is linked above has more information and troubleshooting options if you are having issues getting everything working. Step 4: Basic Examples\nThe easiest example to test your board is the “Blink” example. Most boards have a built in LED, so you can use the “Blink” example to make sure that you can upload code to the board. Find the example by opening the Arduino IDE, then going to “File” – “Examples” – “Basics” – “Blink”. You can change the Pin from 13 to whatever pin the LED is on on your board. The delay(1000) will pause the program for the specified amount of time. It is called in milliseconds, so 1000 means the program will pause for 1 second. Step 5: Conclusion\nWe learned how to get started using an Arduino in your project. Arduinos are a powerful, cost effective microcontroller that can be used in a variety of projects.\n\nThe Due board for Arduino is a microcontroller board based on the Atmel SAM3X8E ARM Cortex-M3 CPU.

In addition, if the games you want to play do not demand more than 8 GB of RAM, you might as well save money and invest it in something more worthwhile! 32 GB is also a realistic option if you have the funds and want to future-proof your system or if you want to utilize the computer for memory-intensive jobs such as game programming or video editing. Otherwise, buying such high-capacity gear makes little sense. If you wish to update the memory in your computer or build your computer, you must check that the memory you purchase is compatible with the computer’s other components. Before considering speed and other advantages, selecting the proper memory technology is necessary. Check out: First DDR5 memory modules by SK Hynix\n\nArduino Due is here! Arduino announces the release of the new Arduino Due board based on the Cortex M3 ARM processor\nThe release of the 1.0 Arduino platform in 2011 represented a milestone for Open Source Hardware: after six years of development, Arduino is declared mature and stable. Once this was achieved, the team applied itself to the new version of Arduino designed to provide more creative options to users. The result of this work is the Arduino Due, a board that provides increased performance and faster connectivity at an affordable price (49 USD MSRP). Arduino Due is ideal for those who want to build projects that require high computing power such as the remotely-controlled drones that, in order to fly, need to process a lot of sensor data per second. Arduino Due gives students the opportunity to learn the inner workings of the ARM processor in a cheaper and much simpler way than before. To Scientific projects, which need to acquire data quickly and accurately, Arduino Due provides a platform to create open source tools that are much more advanced than those available now. The new platform enables the open source digital fabrication community (3d Printers, Laser cutters, CNC milling machines) to achieve higher resolutions and faster speed with fewer components than in the past. Main features of Arduino Due\n• The board is equipped with a SAM3X8E processor from Atmel, based on the 32 bit ARM Cortex M3 architecture running at 84MHz. • USB 2.0 interface running at 480 Megabits that allows Arduino Due to act as a USB Host (so you can interface it to USB devices like mice, keyboards, cameras, mobile phones and more). Arduino Due supports the Android ADK 2012 protocol. • 12 analog inputs (ADC) with 12-bit resolution and high speed, opening the door to audio applications and signal processing projects that were impossible with Arduino Uno. • High-resolution Analog outputs (DAC). The board provides two 12-bit outputs that can be used to generate audio signals. The Arduino Due software comes with software examples for a WAV and OGG player. • 4 high-speed serial communication ports. • 70 input\/output pins. • High-speed CAN interface. The CAN protocol is used in the automotive industry to network the different components of the car, is now becoming popular in the field of industrial automation thanks to its speed and ability to withstand electrical noise. • 12 PWM channels. • 2 I2C bus.

A simple memory upgrade will often greatly improve your PC's performance. An example of a memory chip is shown above. These can be found within your PC on the computer's main board (also known as the motherboard). In order to assess your memory requirements, it is essential to understand two things. Firstly, the memory module capacity of your motherboard, and secondly, the specific types of memory modules needed. This information is available from your motherboard manual, but quite often this manual has been lost. Thankfully, there is an easy way to identify this information. A very useful tool provided by memory manufacturers Crucial Technologies, which can be found here : http:\/\/www.crucial.com\/uk\/systemscanner\/ (this link will open up in a new browser page). Downloading and running the Crucial System Scanner is easy. 1. First, agree to the\nterms and conditions. 2. Click the \"download the scanner\" button, and choose \"Save File\" when prompted. 3. Save the file to your desktop, or anywhere you prefer. 4. Navigate to this saved CrucialScan.exe file and open. If you get a security warning, click \"Run\" to allow the download. 5. It will take several moments while your browser is updated with your scan results. This will provide you with information similar to that shown in the following screen capture. This tells you 4 things which I have highlighted below:\n1) The motherboard model (and a quick search on Google will reveal the manufacturer, if not shown as is the case here). 2) The number of available slots in which memory can be insserted, and the number already in use (in this case, 2 x 1GB modules occupy two slots, with two more slots unused)\n3) the type of memory used by the motherboard - again, in this case, it shows two diferent speeds of memory 2700 or 3200 of type DDR. It also shows that DDR PC3200 modules are currently present. 4) Motherboard specification. It may be that you already have filled your motherboard, and that an upgrade will require new higher capacity memory modules to replace your existing configuration. For instance, your motherboard may have two slots which supports a maximum of 1GB, but you already have 2 x 256MB modules installed (512MB total). Therfore you will likely need to fit 2 x 512MB modules to replace the existing 256MB modules in order to achieve this maximum capacity. I hope this helps in understanding the basic needs of memory module selection! Please keep checking back for other hints and tips!

Arduino boards are open-source electronics platform that can be used to easily interface with hardware and sensors to expand the possibilities of your project. Arduino started in Italy in 2005. It has expanded over the years, with multiple manufacturers and distributors around the world. Arduino also has the Arduino IDE, the software that you use to program the board. The Arduino is a great educational tool to learn the basics of coding and electronics. There are lots of boards, starter kits, and shields to ensure that whatever your project is, you can find the parts for it. Arduino is simple enough that beginners can dive in easily, yet has enough options that advanced users can use it as well. The Arduino software can be used with any Windows, Linux or Mac computer. See the Official Arduino Introduction for a more in depth overview of the board. You can also see the Arduino Foundations page to get an idea of what’s involved in Arduino programming. Step 2: Which board do I use? Through the years, there have been many revisions of the Arduino board. We will go over a few key differences between the boards. You can see a full overview of all the Arduino products here: www.arduino.cc\/en\/Main\/Products\nThese boards are good for getting started with, and good for basic programming. Arduino Uno – Get it now! This is the basic beginners board. It has 14 digital input\/outputs (6 of which can be PWM pins), 6 analog inputs, and a 16MHz clock. This allows it to interface with a variety of sensors and applications. The Uno operates at 5V, and can be powered via the USB port, or it can take an input voltage of 6-20V (7-12 recommended) on the Vin pin. The 5V pin can supply 1A max for powering external sensors and outputs, if more then that is required you need an external power supply. If you try to draw more then 1A, the board will be damaged. The Arduino Uno measures 2.7″ by 2.1″. Arduino Micro – Get it now! The Arduino Micro is a small control board for when space is at a premium in your project. It measures 0.7″ by 1.9″. The Arduino Micro has many of the same specifications as the Uno, with a few differences. The Micro has 20 digital input\/output pins. 7 can be used as PWM pins, 12 as analog inputs. The serial communication with the computer is done differently, see the Arduino Leonardo board for more details. Arduino Pro\/Pro Micro\nThe Arduino Pro is a board with a few different versions. The Pro is a full sized board, compatible with the various shields. The Pro Mini measures 0.7″ by 1.3″, which makes it perfect for small projects. Each board comes in a 5V and 3.3V version. There are no headers attached to the board, which makes it slightly harder to use for prototyping, but gives it more flexibility when you are soldering the board into your project. The Arduino Pro has many of the same specifications as the Uno, with a few differences.The 3.3V version runs on a 8MHz clock, the 5V has a 16MHz clock. For power input, you need 3.3-12V for the 3.3V board, and 5-12V for the 5V board. The Arduino Nano is used for when you want the size of an Arduino Micro, but the functionality of an Uno. It has 14 digital input\/output pins (6 can be PWM), 8 analog inputs, and a 16MHz clock. It runs on 5V, taking an input power voltage of 7-12V. It measures 0.73″ x 1.7″. More Advanced Boards:\nThese boards have more advanced features for your next level projects. Arduino Mega – Get it now! The Arduino Mega is used for projects with tons of inputs and outputs. All the specs are the same as the Arduino Uno, but it has 54 digital inputs\/outputs (14 can be PWM), 16 analog inputs, and 4 UARTs for serial communication. It measures 2.1″ by 4″. Arduino Leonardo – Get it now! The Arduino Leonardo has the same specifications as the Arduino Micro. The big difference between the Leonardo\/Micro and all the other boards, is that there is no external chip for USB programming. Everything is built in to one controller. This allows these boards to be connected through a “Virtual COM port”, and allows the Leonardo\/Micro to communicate as a keyboard\/mouse to the computer. This also means that unlike the other boards, there is no reset when the serial port is opened.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:7c5d5e43-7417-4570-8ecf-9acade1da1ed>"]},{"passage":"Best hardware solutions for Andruino project\nArduino Mega 2560\nThe Arduino Mega 2560 is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega2560.

Arduino Due – Get it now! The Arduino Due is the biggest and baddest of the boards. The most crucial difference between this board and the others is that it runs at 3.3V, not 5V. This means that you may need external circuitry to interface this with regular 5V sensors. You can still input 7-12V, but the input\/output pins require 3.3V. The Arduino Due is the size of a Mega, 2.1″ by 4″. It has 54 digital inputs\/outputs (12 can be PWM), 12 analog inputs, and 4 UARTs for serial communication. It runs on a 32 bit processor, running at 84MHz. This allows it to do bigger calculations (4 bytes at a time, rather then 2), over 5 times faster then the other Arduino boards. This makes the programs run up to 10x faster. The Due also has an unlimited number of interrupt pins, due to the second processor, allowing it to get even more feedback from the world around it. Arduino Ethernet – Get it now! The Arduino Ethernet board is like a Arduino Uno with an Ethernet shield built into it. There is also a micro SD card reader built in. It has the same number of inputs\/outputs as the Uno, but 4 are used for communication with the Ethernet system, and 4 are used for the SD reader. This leaves 6 available digital input\/outputs (4 can be PWM), and 6 analog inputs. By using the ethernet port, you can connect this board to the internet to open a whole new world of possibilities for your projects. The Arduino Yun is a very special board. First, is a combination of two processors. One processor runs the Arduino programs, and the other processor runs a Linux distribution that allows you to write shell and python scripts. Second, it has built in WiFi and Ethernet capabilities, to make it easy to connect your projects to the internet. Finally, it has a built in SD card reader to expand the storage space of your programs. The Yun has 20 digital input\/output pins (7 can be PWM), 12 analog inputs, and a 16MHz clock. It measures 2.09″ by 2.87″. Now that we’ve gone over all the Arduino boards, it’s time to move on to setting up the software! Step 3: Software Setup\nOnce you’ve picked your board, you need to install all the software and drivers so that you can start programming! Arduino has written the best getting started guide, see here for the various instructions for each board. Once all the drivers and the Arduino IDE is installed, you can begin programming. Before you can upload code, ensure that the correct board and port is selected. On the top menus, go to “Tools” – “Board”, and choose which board you are using. Then, go to “Tools” – “Port” and choose the port that corresponds to your Arduino. The getting started guide that is linked above has more information and troubleshooting options if you are having issues getting everything working. Step 4: Basic Examples\nThe easiest example to test your board is the “Blink” example. Most boards have a built in LED, so you can use the “Blink” example to make sure that you can upload code to the board. Find the example by opening the Arduino IDE, then going to “File” – “Examples” – “Basics” – “Blink”. You can change the Pin from 13 to whatever pin the LED is on on your board. The delay(1000) will pause the program for the specified amount of time. It is called in milliseconds, so 1000 means the program will pause for 1 second. Step 5: Conclusion\nWe learned how to get started using an Arduino in your project.

It will take several moments while your browser is updated with your scan results. This will provide you with information similar to that shown in the following screen capture. This tells you 4 things which I have highlighted below:\n1) The motherboard model (and a quick search on Google will reveal the manufacturer, if not shown as is the case here). 2) The number of available slots in which memory can be insserted, and the number already in use (in this case, 2 x 1GB modules occupy two slots, with two more slots unused)\n3) the type of memory used by the motherboard - again, in this case, it shows two diferent speeds of memory 2700 or 3200 of type DDR. It also shows that DDR PC3200 modules are currently present. 4) Motherboard specification. It may be that you already have filled your motherboard, and that an upgrade will require new higher capacity memory modules to replace your existing configuration. For instance, your motherboard may have two slots which supports a maximum of 1GB, but you already have 2 x 256MB modules installed (512MB total). Therfore you will likely need to fit 2 x 512MB modules to replace the existing 256MB modules in order to achieve this maximum capacity. I hope this helps in understanding the basic needs of memory module selection! Please keep checking back for other hints and tips!

A ceremony will take place Wednesday at 4 p.m. at Government House.\n\nAlberta is renowned for its natural beauty, richness in fossils and for housing important nature reserves. Alberta is home to six UNESCO World Heritage Sites: The Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks, Dinosaur Provincial Park, the Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump, Waterton–Glacier International Peace Park, Wood Buffalo National Park and Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park. Other popular sites include: Banff, Canmore, Drumheller, Jasper, Sylvan Lake and Lake Louise. Alberta was named after Princess Louise Caroline Alberta (1848–1939), the fourth daughter of Queen Victoria. Princess Louise was the wife of John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, Governor General of Canada (1878–83). Lake Louise and Mount Alberta were also named in her honour. The name \"Alberta\" itself is a feminine Latinized form of Albert, the name of Princess Louise's father, the Prince Consort (cf. Latin: [[Albertus (given name)|Albertus]], masculine) and its Germanic cognates, ultimately derived from Proto-Germanic *Aþalaberhtaz (compound of \"noble\" + \"bright\/famous\"). Alberta's southern border is the 49th parallel north, which separates it from the U.S. state of Montana. The 60th parallel north divides Alberta from the Northwest Territories. The 110th meridian west separates it from the province of Saskatchewan; while on the west its boundary with British Columbia follows the 120th meridian west south from the Northwest Territories at 60°N until it reaches the Continental Divide at the Rocky Mountains, and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the Continental Divide in a generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the Montana border at 49°N. The province extends north to south and east to west at its maximum width. Its highest point is at the summit of Mount Columbia in the Rocky Mountains along the southwest border while its lowest point is on the Slave River in Wood Buffalo National Park in the northeast. With the exception of the semi-arid steppe of the south-eastern section, the province has adequate water resources. There are numerous rivers and lakes used for swimming, fishing and a range of water sports. There are three large lakes, Lake Claire (1436km2) in Wood Buffalo National Park, Lesser Slave Lake (1168km2), and Lake Athabasca which lies in both Alberta and Saskatchewan. The longest river in the province is the Athabasca River which travels from the Columbia Icefield in the Rocky Mountains to Lake Athabasca. The largest river is the Peace River with an average flow of 2161 m3\/s. The Peace River originates in the Rocky Mountains of northern British Columbia and flows through northern Alberta and into the Slave River, a tributary of the Mackenzie River. Alberta's capital city, Edmonton, is located at about the geographic centre of the province. It is the most northerly major city in Canada, and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern Canada. The region, with its proximity to Canada's largest oil fields, has most of western Canada's oil refinery capacity. Calgary is about south of Edmonton and north of Montana, surrounded by extensive ranching country. Almost 75% of the province's population lives in the Calgary–Edmonton Corridor. The land grant policy to the railroads served as a means to populate the province in its early years. Most of the northern half of the province is boreal forest, while the Rocky Mountains along the southwestern boundary are largely forested (see Alberta Mountain forests and Alberta-British Columbia foothills forests). The southern quarter of the province is prairie, ranging from shortgrass prairie in the southeastern corner to mixed grass prairie in an arc to the west and north of it. The central aspen parkland region extending in a broad arc between the prairies and the forests, from Calgary, north to Edmonton, and then east to Lloydminster, contains the most fertile soil in the province and most of the population.\n\nEvery society confers honours and awards on individual citizens to recognize achievement and special contributions. It's an appropriate way to say thank you and to promote role models for society. Honours provide official recognition of citizens by the people through their head of state - in Canada's case, the Queen. Honours, by international custom, entitle the recipients to wear the \"insignia\" (usually medals on a ribbon) around the neck in some cases, on the left side of the jacket, dress or uniform in most others. Some honours entitle the recipients to post-nominal letters (initials after their names). Awards are a form of recognition which can be given by any organization, including governments, and may take the form of certificates, plaques, trophies, lapel pins and sometimes medals - although these should not be worn in the same place as the insignia of honours. History of Honours and Awards in Saskatchewan\nIn 1985, the Province of Saskatchewan established a comprehensive program to recognize achievement, excellence, and contributions to the public good in the province. The Saskatchewan Honours and Awards Program has three areas: provincial honours, provincial awards and recognition of national honours. The Provincial Emblems and Honours Act, adopted in 1988, defines and protects the honours and their insignia; provides for the Saskatchewan Honours Advisory Council; and outlines the processes of nomination, selection, appointment, and revocation for the honours and awards program in Saskatchewan. The Lieutenant Governor, as Chancellor of the Order and in the name of the Crown, invests the members of the Saskatchewan Order of Merit, presents the Saskatchewan Volunteer Medal, and either presents or authorizes another person to present the Saskatchewan Protective Services Medal. Every year, the Saskatchewan Honours Advisory Council recommends recipients for the Saskatchewan Order of Merit, Saskatchewan Volunteer Medal, the Premier's Service Club Award, and the Saskatchewan Distinguished Service Award. The council also provides the government with advice on provincial honours. The Chief of Protocol acts as Secretary of the Council which has 10 members:\n- a chairperson appointed by the President of the Executive Council for a term not exceeding three years. - four \"ex officio\" members: the Chief Justice of Saskatchewan and the Chief Justice of Queen's Bench, alternating every two-years; the Cabinet Secretary; the President of the University of Saskatchewan or the President of the University of Regina, alternating every two-years; and the Provincial Archivist;\n- not more than five members from the community appointed by the President of the Executive Council for three-year terms. Recommendations for the Premier's Award for Excellence in Public Service and Saskatchewan Protective Services Medal are made by independent selection committees.\n\nAnd while the hurting hasn’t stopped, she feels pride in knowing her son did the right thing, she said. “I’ve lost my son, but he became part of history.”\nThe highest honor\nThe Medal of Honor is the nation’s highest medal for valor in combat that can be awarded to members of the armed forces. It is sometimes referred to as the “Congressional Medal of Honor” because the president awards it on behalf of Congress. Because of the need for accuracy the recommendation process can take in excess of 18 months, with intense scrutiny every step of the way. The medal was first authorized in 1861 for sailors and Marines, and the following year for soldiers as well. Since then, more than 3,400 Medals of Honor have been awarded. Medals of Honor are bestowed only to the bravest of the brave, and that valor must be well-documented. So few Medals of Honor are awarded, in fact, that the only ones awarded after the Vietnam War were bestowed posthumously to Army Master Sgt. Gary I. Gordon and Army Sgt. 1st Class Randall D. Shughart for valor in Somalia in 1993, and posthumously to the most recent recipient, Sgt. 1st Class Paul R. Smith for valor in Iraq. There were no Medals of Honor awarded during Operation Desert Storm or operations in Grenada, Panama and Lebanon. Source: U.S. Army\nAwards by service\nAlthough soldiers have received the lion’s share of the nation’s highest military award, Marines, sailors, airmen and one Coast Guardsman have earned the Medal of Honor as well.

In service with Special Operations Joint Task Force-Afghanistan, Major Richards was contacted about a Mi-17 which had crash landed just 3 kilometers from his site. With the knowledge that enemy insurgents could utilize key components of the military vehicle, Major Richards made quick and decisive decisions to first send a team to guard the downed helicopter. He then proceeded to use his leadership skills in the recovery of the downed rig. During the recovery operations, a firefight ensued with terrorist elements. Due to Major Richards’ solid and quick thinking, United States Army equipment and personnel were evacuated, and 4 insurgents were killed in the process. The leadership accomplishments of Major Richards reflect great credit upon himself, SOJTF-Afghanistan, and the United States Army. This should have a cover letter attached explaining what award the service member is recommended for, his\/her name and serial number, operation, his\/her duty, and previous awards.

Main article: Geography of Alberta\nAlberta, with an area of 661,848 km (255,500 sq mi), is the fourth largest province after Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia. To the south, the province borders on the 49th parallel north, separating it from the US state of Montana, while on the north the 60th parallel north divides it from the Northwest Territories. To the east, the 110th meridian west separates it from the province of Saskatchewan, while on the west its boundary with British Columbia follows the 120th meridian west south from the Northwest Territories at 60°N until it reaches the Continental Divide at the Rocky Mountains, and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the Continental Divide in a generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the Montana border at 49°N.

Latin: [[Albertus (given name)|Albertus]], masculine) and its Germanic cognates, ultimately derived from Proto-Germanic *Aþalaberhtaz (compound of \"noble\" + \"bright\/famous\"). Alberta's southern border is the 49th parallel north, which separates it from the U.S. state of Montana. The 60th parallel north divides Alberta from the Northwest Territories. The 110th meridian west separates it from the province of Saskatchewan; while on the west its boundary with British Columbia follows the 120th meridian west south from the Northwest Territories at 60°N until it reaches the Continental Divide at the Rocky Mountains, and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the Continental Divide in a generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the Montana border at 49°N. The province extends north to south and east to west at its maximum width. Its highest point is at the summit of Mount Columbia in the Rocky Mountains along the southwest border while its lowest point is on the Slave River in Wood Buffalo National Park in the northeast. With the exception of the semi-arid steppe of the south-eastern section, the province has adequate water resources. There are numerous rivers and lakes used for swimming, fishing and a range of water sports. There are three large lakes, Lake Claire (1436km2) in Wood Buffalo National Park, Lesser Slave Lake (1168km2), and Lake Athabasca which lies in both Alberta and Saskatchewan. The longest river in the province is the Athabasca River which travels from the Columbia Icefield in the Rocky Mountains to Lake Athabasca. The largest river is the Peace River with an average flow of 2161 m3\/s. The Peace River originates in the Rocky Mountains of northern British Columbia and flows through northern Alberta and into the Slave River, a tributary of the Mackenzie River. Alberta's capital city, Edmonton, is located at about the geographic centre of the province. It is the most northerly major city in Canada, and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern Canada. The region, with its proximity to Canada's largest oil fields, has most of western Canada's oil refinery capacity. Calgary is about south of Edmonton and north of Montana, surrounded by extensive ranching country. Almost 75% of the province's population lives in the Calgary–Edmonton Corridor. The land grant policy to the railroads served as a means to populate the province in its early years. Most of the northern half of the province is boreal forest, while the Rocky Mountains along the southwestern boundary are largely forested (see Alberta Mountain forests and Alberta-British Columbia foothills forests). The southern quarter of the province is prairie, ranging from shortgrass prairie in the southeastern corner to mixed grass prairie in an arc to the west and north of it. The central aspen parkland region extending in a broad arc between the prairies and the forests, from Calgary, north to Edmonton, and then east to Lloydminster, contains the most fertile soil in the province and most of the population.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:9cd3be2c-844c-4899-9002-ade959501ac2>"]},{"passage":"Every society confers honours and awards on individual citizens to recognize achievement and special contributions. It's an appropriate way to say thank you and to promote role models for society. Honours provide official recognition of citizens by the people through their head of state - in Canada's case, the Queen. Honours, by international custom, entitle the recipients to wear the \"insignia\" (usually medals on a ribbon) around the neck in some cases, on the left side of the jacket, dress or uniform in most others. Some honours entitle the recipients to post-nominal letters (initials after their names). Awards are a form of recognition which can be given by any organization, including governments, and may take the form of certificates, plaques, trophies, lapel pins and sometimes medals - although these should not be worn in the same place as the insignia of honours. History of Honours and Awards in Saskatchewan\nIn 1985, the Province of Saskatchewan established a comprehensive program to recognize achievement, excellence, and contributions to the public good in the province. The Saskatchewan Honours and Awards Program has three areas: provincial honours, provincial awards and recognition of national honours. The Provincial Emblems and Honours Act, adopted in 1988, defines and protects the honours and their insignia; provides for the Saskatchewan Honours Advisory Council; and outlines the processes of nomination, selection, appointment, and revocation for the honours and awards program in Saskatchewan. The Lieutenant Governor, as Chancellor of the Order and in the name of the Crown, invests the members of the Saskatchewan Order of Merit, presents the Saskatchewan Volunteer Medal, and either presents or authorizes another person to present the Saskatchewan Protective Services Medal. Every year, the Saskatchewan Honours Advisory Council recommends recipients for the Saskatchewan Order of Merit, Saskatchewan Volunteer Medal, the Premier's Service Club Award, and the Saskatchewan Distinguished Service Award. The council also provides the government with advice on provincial honours. The Chief of Protocol acts as Secretary of the Council which has 10 members:\n- a chairperson appointed by the President of the Executive Council for a term not exceeding three years. - four \"ex officio\" members: the Chief Justice of Saskatchewan and the Chief Justice of Queen's Bench, alternating every two-years; the Cabinet Secretary; the President of the University of Saskatchewan or the President of the University of Regina, alternating every two-years; and the Provincial Archivist;\n- not more than five members from the community appointed by the President of the Executive Council for three-year terms. Recommendations for the Premier's Award for Excellence in Public Service and Saskatchewan Protective Services Medal are made by independent selection committees.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:8e9dc2db-3ccd-4039-b90d-21e17f0842fd>"]},{"passage":"And while the hurting hasn’t stopped, she feels pride in knowing her son did the right thing, she said. “I’ve lost my son, but he became part of history.”\nThe highest honor\nThe Medal of Honor is the nation’s highest medal for valor in combat that can be awarded to members of the armed forces. It is sometimes referred to as the “Congressional Medal of Honor” because the president awards it on behalf of Congress. Because of the need for accuracy the recommendation process can take in excess of 18 months, with intense scrutiny every step of the way. The medal was first authorized in 1861 for sailors and Marines, and the following year for soldiers as well. Since then, more than 3,400 Medals of Honor have been awarded. Medals of Honor are bestowed only to the bravest of the brave, and that valor must be well-documented. So few Medals of Honor are awarded, in fact, that the only ones awarded after the Vietnam War were bestowed posthumously to Army Master Sgt. Gary I. Gordon and Army Sgt. 1st Class Randall D. Shughart for valor in Somalia in 1993, and posthumously to the most recent recipient, Sgt. 1st Class Paul R. Smith for valor in Iraq.

With the knowledge that enemy insurgents could utilize key components of the military vehicle, Major Richards made quick and decisive decisions to first send a team to guard the downed helicopter. He then proceeded to use his leadership skills in the recovery of the downed rig. During the recovery operations, a firefight ensued with terrorist elements.

Main article: Geography of Alberta\nAlberta, with an area of 661,848 km (255,500 sq mi), is the fourth largest province after Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia. To the south, the province borders on the 49th parallel north, separating it from the US state of Montana, while on the north the 60th parallel north divides it from the Northwest Territories. To the east, the 110th meridian west separates it from the province of Saskatchewan, while on the west its boundary with British Columbia follows the 120th meridian west south from the Northwest Territories at 60°N until it reaches the Continental Divide at the Rocky Mountains, and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the Continental Divide in a generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the Montana border at 49°N. The province extends 1,223 km (760 mi) north to south and 660 km (410 mi) east to west at its maximum width. Its highest point is 3,747 m (12,293 ft) at the summit of Mount Columbia in the Rocky Mountains along the southwest border while its lowest point is 152 m (499 ft) on the Slave River in Wood Buffalo National Park in the northeast. With the exception of the semi-arid steppe of the south-eastern section, the province has adequate water resources. There are numerous rivers and lakes used for swimming, fishing and a range of water sports. There are three large lakes, Lake Claire (1,436 km (554 sq mi)) in Wood Buffalo National Park, Lesser Slave Lake (1,168 km (451 sq mi)), and Lake Athabasca (7,898 square kilometres (3,049 sq mi)) which lies in both Alberta and Saskatchewan. The longest river in the province is the Athabasca River which travels 1,538 km (956 mi) from the Columbia Icefield in the Rocky Mountains to Lake Athabasca. The largest river is the Peace River with an average flow of 2161 m\/s.

Unfortunately, it's not always easy to offer an apology or to admit that we have done something wrong. Some people seem to have a more difficult time than others do when it comes to acknowledging their faults and making amends. Many factors -- including our upbringing, age, gender, personalities, geographic location, religious or spiritual beliefs, and culture -- can influence how skilled and comfortable we are in apologizing for our actions. This guide provides some tips for offering an effective apology. What is An Apology? An apology is a statement that expresses regret over an action or asks pardon for a fault or offense. An effective apology both acknowledges responsibility and expresses remorse. Statements such as \"I am very sorry,\" \"How can I make up for this?\" and \"I won't ever do that again\" are examples of the ways in which we can admit that we are at fault and that we regret our actions. Good apologies can prevent small problems from escalating and are a useful tool in conflict resolution. An effective apology -- one that is thoughtful, genuine and timely – can eases tension, restores trust, and benefits both parties. On the other hand, an insincere apology can make matters worse. Most people can sense when someone is being insincere and they may become even more offended than they initially were. When people feel that they have been wronged and fail to receive the apology they deserve, they often continue to feel hurt and resentment and are more likely to seek revenge or punishment. As you might imagine, it becomes much more difficult to resolve the offense and to move forward. How to Offer An Apology\nAre you involved in a conflict in which you must apologize to someone? Here are some elements you might want to include. - Acknowledge what you did. \"I arrived an hour late for our meeting and did not make my presentation.\" - Take responsibility for your actions and admit that you made a mistake or behaved inappropriately. \"I know that people were counting on me to describe our project. It was my responsibility to let people know that I was running late. I know that I was wrong.\" - Acknowledge the impact that your actions may have had on other people. This might include bruised feelings, inconvenience, stress, or other costs. \"My absence created a great deal of confusion among the other team members, made us appear to be disorganized, and meant that everyone had to work later.\" - Apologize for having caused pain or having done damage. \"I am sorry for the inconvenience I caused and for placing the project in jeopardy.\" - Repair the damage and state your future intentions. An effective apology must include corrective action and convey your desire not to repeat this mistake. \"I would like to make up for my absence by sending everyone a written copy of my presentation. In the future, I will notify people that I may be late and will arrange to have someone cover for me in my absence.\" One of the quickest ways to ruin a perfectly good apology is to offer an excuse or try to cast blame somewhere else. When we err, we sometimes find it easier to offer excuses or to try to justify our actions than to say we are sorry. Excuses such as \"I wasn't feeling well,\" and \"the phone was busy,\" allow us to avoid blame. Although we may acknowledge that a mistake occurred, excuses enable us to deny responsibility for the mistake. \"But It's Much More Complicated...\"\nMost of us, at one time or another, have encountered complex situations in which multiple persons share responsibility for having contributed to a problem. We not only need to offer an apology, we expect to receive an apology from another person. At other times, we may believe that we have not done anything wrong and, consequently, are reluctant to apologize. In these complex situations, conversations between the involved persons might help to clarify each person's concerns and feelings.

As we all know, relationships aren’t perfect. This permits the possibility that sometimes, we might utter or do wrong and hurtful things to our partners. This means that once we hurt our spouse (whether deliberately or accidentally), their impact are bound to take effect on our loved one consequently, affecting the relationship. The remedy for doing wrong is by apologizing. But unfortunately, sincere apologies are tough to carry out. Thankfully, this step-by-step guide is all the difference to ace an apology game. Admit you’re wrong\nPerhaps one of the mistakes individuals make when apologizing, is refusing to admit their wrong doing. Selfishness, pride, and the need to always be right are a few flaws manifesting during an awful apology. Contrarily, when apologizing correctly, it is important to first admit the wrongful act. It doesn’t matter whether your mind keeps repeating how ‘totally right you handled the (wrongful) situation’. By humbling yourself and placing the happiness of your partner first, you can go about apologizing the right way. Take care to choose your words wisely. For instance, never say something silly like, ‘I apologize if the way I acted offended you’, or ‘I’m sorry that you think I did the wrong thing’. These two phrases although masked as apologies, simple denote that; ultimately you are right and your partner (is merely being dramatic) for finding your actions or words offensive. Try using more precise words or phrases expressing your acknowledgement of wrong-doing instead. For instance, saying, ‘I am sorry for the way I acted earlier’, or ‘I am sorry. I shouldn’t have said the things I said earlier.’ These phrases successfully convey that you have manned (or womaned) up to accept your errors. Admit that you hurt your partner’s feelings\nAfter you have passed through stage 1 successfully, your partner will need to hear that you also hurt their feelings. Remember you and your partner are a team hence, in communicating your apology, acknowledging both of you as major subjects in the matter is paramount. How exactly did you hurt your partner’s feelings? Was it what you said or did? Did you refer to them as ‘lazy’, ‘slow’, ‘stubborn’, etc. Did you passive-aggressively refuse to speak to them throughout the week and etcetera? Whatever it was, you have to openly admit to your spouse that although you said or did those things, you’re equally aware that their feelings were hurt. Remember, you cannot rebuild your relationship without first addressing those things that went collapsed (went wrong). Express your remorse sincerely\nTo express remorse typically means the manner in which you demonstrate your regretful acknowledgement of an offence you committed. Language, tone of voice, facial expression and body language must all play together in convincing your partner that you’re truly apologetic for failing them. It is for this reason that apologies to your spouse (no matter how little), must be done face-to-face. This way they can feel, sense and see the sincerity of your expression of regret. Offer to make amends\nOffering to make amends after an apology is different from buying your spouse’s affection. This simple difference is often misinterpreted by some couples making the error of trying to buy the affection of the offended partner through gifts,and cash. The aforementioned strategy is only short-lived with repercussions lasting for long. Instead try to make practical and sustainable amends. If you’re finding it difficult, ask your partner how you can make it up and down. If they however, insist you figure it out on your own, get to work and figure it out. Consult books and relationship experts to point you in the right direction. Do not impose forgiveness on your partner\nHaving practised stages 1 to 4, it’s only human that you expect your partner’s instant forgiveness. But this isn’t always the case. Just as individual faces differ, so also do their personality and consequently, their response to forgiveness. Should your partner not have admitted they have forgiven you, be patient. Never try to blackmail your partner emotionally to forgive you.\n\nThe Art of Apology\nLet's face it: when you work and study with others, sooner or later something will happen that could prompt you or someone else to think an apology could help restore the balance in the relationship. But how do you actually apologize, if you determine that's what is needed? The following is shared with the permission of its author, Marsha Wagner, ombudsperson at Columbia University. Elements of an Effective Apology\nAn apology is a powerful means of reconciliation and restoring trust. However, sometimes even a well-intentioned apology can exacerbate a conflict. It may be helpful to consider what elements to include in a statement of apology to make it most effective and constructive. Not all elements apply to all situations. Some of the most common considerations include the following:\n1. A common understanding of the exact substance and nature of the offense, or perceived offense (Example: “Yesterday on the telephone, I said….”)\n2. Recognition of responsibility or accountability on the part of the one who offended\n(Example: “I could have chosen other words.” “I spoke without thinking.”)\n3. Acknowledgement of the pain or embarrassment that the offended party experienced\n(Example: “It’s understandable that was upsetting to you.” “If someone had said that to me, I would not have liked it, either.” But not, “I’m sorry you’re so easily hurt.”)\n4. A judgment about the offense (Example: “I was insensitive.” “What I did was wrong.”)\n5. A statement of regret (Example: “I’m sorry I used those words.”)\n6. An indication of future intentions (Example: “In the future, I will try to think about the impact of my words before speaking.” “I hope we can have a relationship of mutual respect.”)\nSometimes it is helpful to include an explanation of why the perceived offender acted in this way, but it’s important not to reiterate the offense or to give a flippant excuse or defensive justification. (Example: “What I did was a poor attempt at humor.” But not, “When I’m mad, I can say anything but I don’t really mean it.”)\nThe circumstances of the apology are also important, and should be carefully planned. Many people appreciate a written apology, because it implies time and effort put into this step toward reconciliation. Some people who have been offended want an opportunity to state the intensity of their pain or embarrassment directly to the offender. Some people would appreciate a face-to-face apology, and a chance to shake hands or otherwise take the next step toward improved future relations. Some people who apologize want an acknowledgement that the apology has been received, or that the offender is forgiven. © 2003 Marsha L. Wagner, Columbia University\n\nI recently found myself in a situation where I needed to apologize to someone I hurt. I was conflicted, my thoughts filled with self-justifying righteousness, “I am right, and I am hurt, too!” Yet at the same time, I was filled with regret, choking on unfinished words and self-reproach. “This isn’t turning out the way I want it to,” I said to myself. Ugh…the only way to get myself out of my self-inflected situation was to say, “I’m sorry.”\nApologizing is difficult, especially when the stakes are high and the hurt runs deep. It’s easy to let yourself off the hook, blaming the other person and minimizing your role in the situation. When you finally bring yourself to say the words, stress hormones flood the body creating fight or flight responses. Your brain screams, “Don’t do it! Run!” or “Get mad! Don’t go down without a fight!” It’s takes everything in your power to go through with it. Your mind spins as you think of the million ways to express yourself. But in the end, it’s worth it. When you apologize, it allows space for both you and the other person to move forward, to let go, to forgive. It will make you and the other person feel better. So how do you apologize the right way? Write Down the Outcomes You Want\nBefore you go into a high stress situation, know what you want to get out of it. Write down your desired outcomes and keep them handy during the conversation; it will help you stay on track if the person responds emotionally and you can review them if you find yourself getting emotional or making excuses. Examples of outcomes might be to repair a damaged relationship, defuse an emotional situation, or simply to own your part in a conflict. Check Your Emotions. Choose How You Want to Feel\nEmotions don’t have to dictate your feelings and reactions. Even when they are strong, you can still choose how you want to feel. You can choose to feel compassion, relief, or ownership. Or you can also choose to feel angry, justified, or shameful. It’s up to you to determine your outlook on the situation, so check your emotions and choose to see the bright side of apologizing. Apologize. Own it. Don’t Over Explain Your Actions\nIt’s best to just say, “I am sorry; I own what I did.” Most people don’t want to hear excuses because they water down the apology and make it feel insincere. Sometimes though, it may be appropriate to explain your side, but only do it to help the person forgive, not to minimize your role in what happened. Over explaining sounds like excuse making. Express Regret, Be Specific\nIn addition to saying, “I’m sorry,” you should express regret for hurting the other person. For example, “I regret hurting you; it was wrong of me to blame you and it damaged our relationship. Our relationship is important to me and I understand that I have to earn your trust back.” This validates the person’s feelings which is what most people want out of an apology. Being specific brings a tone of sincerity and it shows you understand how your actions affected the person. Ask Questions and Listen\nRemember, the person you are apologizing to isn’t there to only hear you out. Give him or her the opportunity to respond. Ask questions to draw out meaningful dialogue, listen carefully and don’t get defensive. Make Commitments and Keep Them\nAfter you’ve apologized and expressed regret, make a commitment to change your behavior. Outline what you are going to do differently and follow through. Everyone makes mistakes but there is nothing worse than repeating it because you didn’t change your behavior. Trust can be rebuilt quickly if you demonstrate that you’ve learned from what happened. Smile, Say Thank You and Leave\nAt the end of your apology, smile. Smiling makes everyone feel better and it releases tension. Thank the person for listening and then leave. Most people need time to process and hanging around afterwards doesn’t allow the space required to do so. Following these steps will help you deliver a sincere, meaningful apology and will start the process of forgiveness. As famous cartoonist Lynn Johnson famously wrote, “An apology is the super glue of life. It can repair just about anything.”\nThanks for reading and as always, I appreciate comments, likes and shares! We all have high maintenance people in our lives.\n\nHave you ever had someone apologize to you but you questioned their sincerity? Have you ever asked yourself ‘why?’ It’s probably because they did not speak your apology language. They said, “I’m sorry.” But what you wanted to hear was, “I was wrong.” They said, “Will you forgive me?” But what you wanted to hear was, “What can I do to make this right?” After three years of surveys, we have concluded that there are five basic elements to an apology. We have titled them the five languages of apology. Each person has a primary apology language, and one of the five speaks more deeply to them emotionally than the other four. The danger is that if you don’t speak their language, they may consider your apology insincere. 1. Expressing Regret: Say, “I’m sorry. I feel badly about what I did.” Show that you understand how your actions affected them. Expressing an understanding of the pain caused by your offense. Be specific. Remove the emotional barrier in your relationship by conveying your deep sorrow about your actions. 2. Accepting Responsibility: Say, “I was wrong.” “It was my fault.” Resist the temptation to blame others, excuse your actions, or deny responsibility for the offense. If you can fully shoulder the responsibility for the offense, gaining forgiveness will be much easier. 3. Making Restitution: Ask, “What can I do to make it right?” Offer to restore the other person to their prior status by reclaiming their reputation, providing resources for restoration, or taking steps to rebuild their trust. 4. Genuinely Repenting: Make this commitment: “I’ll try not to do that again.” Engage in problem-solving to prevent a similar offense from occurring in the future. Follow up with a credible action plan. 5. Requesting Forgiveness: Ask, “Will you please forgive me?” Realize that some people won’t believe you are really trying to make things right until you humbly ask for their forgiveness. In their mind, it is your willingness to give up your control and put the future of the relationship in their hands that conveys your sincerity. If you don’t know what others are looking for you to do, you will feel frustrated and won’t know how to proceed. The problem is not your sincere affection or remorse; it’s that you may not be speaking their language. Arm yourself with these practical tips. Speaking the right language to your partner, friends, and co-workers can boost all these vital relationships.\n\nWe know that you’re probably already familiar with love languages. Now, meet the five apology languages. I bet you didn’t know that there are different ways of apologizing, however, understanding your apology language can make a huge impact on your relationships. The idea of love languages and apology languages were both coined by author and radio hot Gary Chapman, Ph.D. He published the book “The Five Languages of Apology” in 2006 and lists these five languages as expressing regret, accepting responsibility, making restitution, genuinely repenting and requesting forgiveness. Take a look at our guide to the five apology languages in the gallery below, then let us know your apology language in the comments section on social media. If your apologies often start with “I’m Sorry,” then your apology language may be expressing regret. This is one of the most simple and straight forward apology languages, often going along the lines of “I’m sorry that I hurt you.” If this is your apology language, it’s important to look within and recognized the hurt you caused to the other person. If your apologies revolve around admitting what you’ve done wrong, then your apology language may be accepting responsibility. This apology language is similar to expressing regret, however, it specifically resolves around accepting wrongdoing to the other person. It often sounds like “I was wrong” or “I made a mistake.” If this is your apology language, be clear with what you’ve done wrong and keep it short yet sincere. If your apologies include phrases like “How can I make it up to you?” then your apology language may be making restitution. This apology language is all about promising an action and hopefully, delivering. It often sounds like “Let me make it up to you” or “Next time, I’ll do_____ to make sure it doesn’t happen again.” If this is your apology language, make sure you actually take action and make it up to the person you’re apologizing. If your apologies show your desire to make a change, then your apology language may be genuinely repenting. This apology language is all about verbalizing that you feel badly and want to go about things differently. It often sounds like “I wish I hadn’t done that. What can I do to not do it again?” If this is your apology language, make sure you follow up on your desire to change. If your apologies include you begging for forgiveness over asking for permission, then your apology language may be requesting forgiveness. This apology language isn’t just about begging, it’s giving the other person the time to think and process what you’ve done. It often sounds like “Can you forgive me?” or “I hope you will forgive me.” If this is your apology language, be sure not to use it as a manipulative tactic and allow the other person to make their choice on their own accord.\n\nIn these cases you contribute something else to the person you harmed. You can work it out with them to figure out what would be acceptable. You might also make restitution to show others that you are a good person. This line of thought comes from the virtue signaling ethic, and while it is great that you are doing the right thing, this is not the best way too apologize. It could lead you to think that you can just balance your bad deeds with good deeds, but this idea fails to strengthen the bonds that you have with others. Language 3: Request Forgiveness\nWhen you request forgiveness from someone you are showing them that their opinion really matters to you, and you want to rebuild the relationship that you have with them. This follows the negotiation ethic which states that you should change your social contracts in order to benefit everyone involved in them. When you request forgiveness you recognize that your actions went against the best interest of the person you wronged, and that you should have received their permission before acting. The autonomy ethic states that you should change your values in order to bolster your identity depending on each scenario. If you request forgiveness not because you care about what the other person thinks, but to avoid retribution from them, then you are following this ethic. This request for forgiveness is not a heartfelt apology because you are only thinking of yourself. Language 4: Accept Responsibility\nThe responsibility ethic states that you should change your social contracts in order to help the people you lead. When you accept the responsibility for your actions you try to manage the consequences of your actions. This shows the people that you have wronged that you still want to help them. You don't want your actions to be a burden to them. The branding ethic states that you should change your values in order to best embody the things you represent. If you take responsibility of your actions so that you can save your image this is a great thing to do, but it isn't a great apology. It shows people that you care about yourself more than the people that you harmed. Language 5: Expressing Regret\nWhen you express regret for your behavior you are being accountable to others. This follows the fifth relationship ethic which states that you must hold other people accountable for their actions by telling them how their actions have influenced others. When you express regret you tell the person you have wronged that you realize how much your actions have hurt them, and let them know that you wish you hadn't hurt them because of how much they mean to you. The self assessment ethic is the opposing ethic it states that you should evaluate your own behavior, and determine if it is actually beneficial to you. You might feel bad because you realize that your behavior is wrong and it is hurting you. But this regret is not an apology, because you don't have anyone to express it to. If you do express regret to someone because you realize that your actions are hurting yourself you will seem insincere. They will probably be like the kid with terrible drawing skills, and claim you aren't actually sorry, just sorry that your actions caught up to you. Although there are several ways to apologize, not all of the methods are necessary every time. For instance the kid whose feelings I hurt seemed to be fine after I expressed regret, and I stopped hurting his feelings. Something that I did not talk about is the relationship between personality, and apology methods. Gary Chapman's work focusses on this topic a lot, and suggests that for some people one of the apology methods will resonate with them far better than the others. One other thing that I wanted to point out is that the different apology methods are also the steps of repentance. So repentance is making an apology to God for the sins that you committed against Him. Its purpose is to initiate the rebuilding of your relationship with God. If done properly both repentance and apologizing will lead you to become a better person, and they will allow God and others to regain their trust in you.\n\nWomen apologize way too much; hey, we’re all socialized with that expectation. Because of this, one might think that when the times comes for us to say “I’m sorry” to someone who actually deserves it, we’d be rockstars at it. But unfortunately, this isn’t always the case. Saying these two little words can be quite a trying task, even when we really think we mean them and despite knowing that they’re imperative to mending and maintaining all of our relationships. Nick Hobson, director of science for PsychologyCompass and a behavioral scientist who researches emotional functioning, makes it simple with his step-by-step instructions. 1. Do it face-to-face\nAs it does most things, technology can convolute apologies too. For this reason, Hobson recommends you apologize to someone in person rather than via email, text, or even a phone call. “The sincerity in social cues will come through much more in person,” he says. “There’s far too much ambiguity in word use and tone that gets lost. It will only make things worse.” An in-person apology might be intimidating, but in the end, you owe it to them. 2. Actually mean it\nAnd, of course, for any apology to prove effective, the apologizer must be genuinely sorry for their words or actions. Fake apologies are fairly transparent, Hobson says, especially thanks to body language, tone, etc., if you’re following instruction #1. As much as not apologizing for your words and actions will weaken a relationship, a feigned apology can tank things even faster. 3. Take responsibility\nMost people love talking about themselves, so why not keep it up when saying you’re sorry? Cue the “I” statements! “The apology should include an acknowledgment of personal responsibility,” explains Hobson. “What a lot of people tend to do is offer an apology saying where they went wrong.” This will mean a lot more to a person than blaming their hurt feelings on an outside factor — or worse, on them. 4. Provide context\nThis is the one part of an apology when you’re able to explain your understanding of where things went wrong and why. But this step leaves room for some big mistakes, such as, say, sounding like you’re trying to justify or excuse your behavior. Ensure the context is about reassuring the person you hurt that you understand where you went wrong and how to prevent it from recurring — not about making yourself look better. “After explaining what happened, the person apologizing should add the important caveat that, despite the rationale, they still recognize what they did was wrong, selfish, mean, etc.,” Hobson says. 5. Make up for it\nAnyone who’s received an empty apology has been able to identify it after the fact because the person kept up their problematic behavior. “A person feeling wronged by another will be looking for some honest signal that says they’re not going to do it again,” asserts Hobson. “A key tactic, then, is to build in the apology, at the moment or shortly after, an act of generosity or kindness.” Taking the time to ensure they feel appreciated and cared for by you after breaking their trust is paramount to rebuilding your relationship. What’s your “I’m sorry” strategy? Let us know @BritandCo. This article first appeared on Brit + Co.\n\nWhile an earnest apology takes a minute or two to make, accepting an apology can take a day, a week, a month – or two. Or longer. It will differ, as with all things human, from one person to another and from one situation to another. Many articles point out that forgiving does not mean forgetting; in a similar light accepting an apology does not equate to everything being forgiven which would suit our sometimes linear thought patterns. As an apology is an acknowledgement of wrong-doing, accepting the apology is an acknowledgement that the wrong-doer feels remorse. Phrased this way, it is all about the wrong doer; the wronged has not yet begun the journey toward mending the relationship which the wrong doer is already two steps into. It is this feeling of being behind in the process that is most difficult to manage. “I know person is sorry, why can’t I get over it?”\nBecause there are many emotions to deal with: betrayal, anger that the incident happened in the first place, fear that it will happen again, and even a sense of loss. We cannot deal with these emotions all at once, and passing one does not mean it will not circle around again at some stage in the process. Communication, perhaps ironically, is vital, not necessarily about what was done as this often leads to blame, but about what is needed. This communication is essential if the parties have different methods of dealing with conflict. Some personalities require introspection, while others need an immediate conversation. Pushing one’s own need onto the other will be counterproductive. If a contemplative, cooling off period is needed, regular phonecalls or texts may draw the process out; if increased trips to the gym are needed, suggesting a lunch date may be viewed as interfering instead of sweet. Once all the above emotions have been worked through, the decision to forgive or not can be made. As stated many times over the years by numerous articles, forgiveness is not synonymous with condoning or forgetting. Forgiving means wanting to remain in the relationship, albeit with potentially different boundaries.\n\n### Question: I need to express regret for something I did, but I want to use a different word than 'sorry.' What are some alternative words I can use to express an apology?","passages":[{"passage":"If you have ever been offended, chances are you already know how far a simple apology can go toward restoring a strained relationship. Unfortunately, it's not always easy to offer an apology or to admit that we have done something wrong. Some people seem to have a more difficult time than others do when it comes to acknowledging their faults and making amends. Many factors -- including our upbringing, age, gender, personalities, geographic location, religious or spiritual beliefs, and culture -- can influence how skilled and comfortable we are in apologizing for our actions. This guide provides some tips for offering an effective apology. What is An Apology? An apology is a statement that expresses regret over an action or asks pardon for a fault or offense. An effective apology both acknowledges responsibility and expresses remorse. Statements such as \"I am very sorry,\" \"How can I make up for this?\" and \"I won't ever do that again\" are examples of the ways in which we can admit that we are at fault and that we regret our actions. Good apologies can prevent small problems from escalating and are a useful tool in conflict resolution. An effective apology -- one that is thoughtful, genuine and timely – can eases tension, restores trust, and benefits both parties. On the other hand, an insincere apology can make matters worse. Most people can sense when someone is being insincere and they may become even more offended than they initially were. When people feel that they have been wronged and fail to receive the apology they deserve, they often continue to feel hurt and resentment and are more likely to seek revenge or punishment. As you might imagine, it becomes much more difficult to resolve the offense and to move forward. How to Offer An Apology\nAre you involved in a conflict in which you must apologize to someone? Here are some elements you might want to include. - Acknowledge what you did. \"I arrived an hour late for our meeting and did not make my presentation.\" - Take responsibility for your actions and admit that you made a mistake or behaved inappropriately. \"I know that people were counting on me to describe our project. It was my responsibility to let people know that I was running late. I know that I was wrong.\" - Acknowledge the impact that your actions may have had on other people. This might include bruised feelings, inconvenience, stress, or other costs. \"My absence created a great deal of confusion among the other team members, made us appear to be disorganized, and meant that everyone had to work later.\" - Apologize for having caused pain or having done damage. \"I am sorry for the inconvenience I caused and for placing the project in jeopardy.\" - Repair the damage and state your future intentions. An effective apology must include corrective action and convey your desire not to repeat this mistake. \"I would like to make up for my absence by sending everyone a written copy of my presentation. In the future, I will notify people that I may be late and will arrange to have someone cover for me in my absence.\" One of the quickest ways to ruin a perfectly good apology is to offer an excuse or try to cast blame somewhere else. When we err, we sometimes find it easier to offer excuses or to try to justify our actions than to say we are sorry. Excuses such as \"I wasn't feeling well,\" and \"the phone was busy,\" allow us to avoid blame. Although we may acknowledge that a mistake occurred, excuses enable us to deny responsibility for the mistake. \"But It's Much More Complicated...\"\nMost of us, at one time or another, have encountered complex situations in which multiple persons share responsibility for having contributed to a problem. We not only need to offer an apology, we expect to receive an apology from another person. At other times, we may believe that we have not done anything wrong and, consequently, are reluctant to apologize. In these complex situations, conversations between the involved persons might help to clarify each person's concerns and feelings.

As we all know, relationships aren’t perfect. This permits the possibility that sometimes, we might utter or do wrong and hurtful things to our partners. This means that once we hurt our spouse (whether deliberately or accidentally), their impact are bound to take effect on our loved one consequently, affecting the relationship. The remedy for doing wrong is by apologizing. But unfortunately, sincere apologies are tough to carry out. Thankfully, this step-by-step guide is all the difference to ace an apology game. Admit you’re wrong\nPerhaps one of the mistakes individuals make when apologizing, is refusing to admit their wrong doing. Selfishness, pride, and the need to always be right are a few flaws manifesting during an awful apology. Contrarily, when apologizing correctly, it is important to first admit the wrongful act. It doesn’t matter whether your mind keeps repeating how ‘totally right you handled the (wrongful) situation’. By humbling yourself and placing the happiness of your partner first, you can go about apologizing the right way. Take care to choose your words wisely. For instance, never say something silly like, ‘I apologize if the way I acted offended you’, or ‘I’m sorry that you think I did the wrong thing’. These two phrases although masked as apologies, simple denote that; ultimately you are right and your partner (is merely being dramatic) for finding your actions or words offensive. Try using more precise words or phrases expressing your acknowledgement of wrong-doing instead. For instance, saying, ‘I am sorry for the way I acted earlier’, or ‘I am sorry. I shouldn’t have said the things I said earlier.’ These phrases successfully convey that you have manned (or womaned) up to accept your errors. Admit that you hurt your partner’s feelings\nAfter you have passed through stage 1 successfully, your partner will need to hear that you also hurt their feelings. Remember you and your partner are a team hence, in communicating your apology, acknowledging both of you as major subjects in the matter is paramount. How exactly did you hurt your partner’s feelings? Was it what you said or did? Did you refer to them as ‘lazy’, ‘slow’, ‘stubborn’, etc. Did you passive-aggressively refuse to speak to them throughout the week and etcetera? Whatever it was, you have to openly admit to your spouse that although you said or did those things, you’re equally aware that their feelings were hurt. Remember, you cannot rebuild your relationship without first addressing those things that went collapsed (went wrong). Express your remorse sincerely\nTo express remorse typically means the manner in which you demonstrate your regretful acknowledgement of an offence you committed. Language, tone of voice, facial expression and body language must all play together in convincing your partner that you’re truly apologetic for failing them. It is for this reason that apologies to your spouse (no matter how little), must be done face-to-face. This way they can feel, sense and see the sincerity of your expression of regret. Offer to make amends\nOffering to make amends after an apology is different from buying your spouse’s affection. This simple difference is often misinterpreted by some couples making the error of trying to buy the affection of the offended partner through gifts,and cash. The aforementioned strategy is only short-lived with repercussions lasting for long. Instead try to make practical and sustainable amends. If you’re finding it difficult, ask your partner how you can make it up and down. If they however, insist you figure it out on your own, get to work and figure it out. Consult books and relationship experts to point you in the right direction. Do not impose forgiveness on your partner\nHaving practised stages 1 to 4, it’s only human that you expect your partner’s instant forgiveness. But this isn’t always the case. Just as individual faces differ, so also do their personality and consequently, their response to forgiveness. Should your partner not have admitted they have forgiven you, be patient. Never try to blackmail your partner emotionally to forgive you.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:da4d6207-49c9-46e9-b2a7-c82967c3af5b>"]},{"passage":"The Art of Apology\nLet's face it: when you work and study with others, sooner or later something will happen that could prompt you or someone else to think an apology could help restore the balance in the relationship.

An indication of future intentions (Example: “In the future, I will try to think about the impact of my words before speaking.” “I hope we can have a relationship of mutual respect.”)\nSometimes it is helpful to include an explanation of why the perceived offender acted in this way, but it’s important not to reiterate the offense or to give a flippant excuse or defensive justification. (Example: “What I did was a poor attempt at humor.” But not, “When I’m mad, I can say anything but I don’t really mean it.”)\nThe circumstances of the apology are also important, and should be carefully planned. Many people appreciate a written apology, because it implies time and effort put into this step toward reconciliation. Some people who have been offended want an opportunity to state the intensity of their pain or embarrassment directly to the offender. Some people would appreciate a face-to-face apology, and a chance to shake hands or otherwise take the next step toward improved future relations. Some people who apologize want an acknowledgement that the apology has been received, or that the offender is forgiven. © 2003 Marsha L.

I was conflicted, my thoughts filled with self-justifying righteousness, “I am right, and I am hurt, too!” Yet at the same time, I was filled with regret, choking on unfinished words and self-reproach. “This isn’t turning out the way I want it to,” I said to myself. Ugh…the only way to get myself out of my self-inflected situation was to say, “I’m sorry.”\nApologizing is difficult, especially when the stakes are high and the hurt runs deep. It’s easy to let yourself off the hook, blaming the other person and minimizing your role in the situation. When you finally bring yourself to say the words, stress hormones flood the body creating fight or flight responses. Your brain screams, “Don’t do it! Run!” or “Get mad! Don’t go down without a fight!” It’s takes everything in your power to go through with it. Your mind spins as you think of the million ways to express yourself. But in the end, it’s worth it. When you apologize, it allows space for both you and the other person to move forward, to let go, to forgive. It will make you and the other person feel better. So how do you apologize the right way? Write Down the Outcomes You Want\nBefore you go into a high stress situation, know what you want to get out of it. Write down your desired outcomes and keep them handy during the conversation; it will help you stay on track if the person responds emotionally and you can review them if you find yourself getting emotional or making excuses. Examples of outcomes might be to repair a damaged relationship, defuse an emotional situation, or simply to own your part in a conflict. Check Your Emotions. Choose How You Want to Feel\nEmotions don’t have to dictate your feelings and reactions. Even when they are strong, you can still choose how you want to feel. You can choose to feel compassion, relief, or ownership. Or you can also choose to feel angry, justified, or shameful. It’s up to you to determine your outlook on the situation, so check your emotions and choose to see the bright side of apologizing. Apologize. Own it. Don’t Over Explain Your Actions\nIt’s best to just say, “I am sorry; I own what I did.” Most people don’t want to hear excuses because they water down the apology and make it feel insincere. Sometimes though, it may be appropriate to explain your side, but only do it to help the person forgive, not to minimize your role in what happened. Over explaining sounds like excuse making. Express Regret, Be Specific\nIn addition to saying, “I’m sorry,” you should express regret for hurting the other person. For example, “I regret hurting you; it was wrong of me to blame you and it damaged our relationship. Our relationship is important to me and I understand that I have to earn your trust back.” This validates the person’s feelings which is what most people want out of an apology. Being specific brings a tone of sincerity and it shows you understand how your actions affected the person. Ask Questions and Listen\nRemember, the person you are apologizing to isn’t there to only hear you out. Give him or her the opportunity to respond. Ask questions to draw out meaningful dialogue, listen carefully and don’t get defensive. Make Commitments and Keep Them\nAfter you’ve apologized and expressed regret, make a commitment to change your behavior. Outline what you are going to do differently and follow through. Everyone makes mistakes but there is nothing worse than repeating it because you didn’t change your behavior. Trust can be rebuilt quickly if you demonstrate that you’ve learned from what happened. Smile, Say Thank You and Leave\nAt the end of your apology, smile. Smiling makes everyone feel better and it releases tension. Thank the person for listening and then leave. Most people need time to process and hanging around afterwards doesn’t allow the space required to do so. Following these steps will help you deliver a sincere, meaningful apology and will start the process of forgiveness. As famous cartoonist Lynn Johnson famously wrote, “An apology is the super glue of life. It can repair just about anything.”\nThanks for reading and as always, I appreciate comments, likes and shares!

Have you ever asked yourself ‘why?’ It’s probably because they did not speak your apology language. They said, “I’m sorry.” But what you wanted to hear was, “I was wrong.” They said, “Will you forgive me?” But what you wanted to hear was, “What can I do to make this right?” After three years of surveys, we have concluded that there are five basic elements to an apology. We have titled them the five languages of apology. Each person has a primary apology language, and one of the five speaks more deeply to them emotionally than the other four. The danger is that if you don’t speak their language, they may consider your apology insincere. 1. Expressing Regret: Say, “I’m sorry. I feel badly about what I did.” Show that you understand how your actions affected them. Expressing an understanding of the pain caused by your offense. Be specific. Remove the emotional barrier in your relationship by conveying your deep sorrow about your actions. 2. Accepting Responsibility: Say, “I was wrong.” “It was my fault.” Resist the temptation to blame others, excuse your actions, or deny responsibility for the offense. If you can fully shoulder the responsibility for the offense, gaining forgiveness will be much easier. 3. Making Restitution: Ask, “What can I do to make it right?” Offer to restore the other person to their prior status by reclaiming their reputation, providing resources for restoration, or taking steps to rebuild their trust. 4. Genuinely Repenting: Make this commitment: “I’ll try not to do that again.” Engage in problem-solving to prevent a similar offense from occurring in the future. Follow up with a credible action plan. 5. Requesting Forgiveness: Ask, “Will you please forgive me?” Realize that some people won’t believe you are really trying to make things right until you humbly ask for their forgiveness. In their mind, it is your willingness to give up your control and put the future of the relationship in their hands that conveys your sincerity. If you don’t know what others are looking for you to do, you will feel frustrated and won’t know how to proceed. The problem is not your sincere affection or remorse; it’s that you may not be speaking their language. Arm yourself with these practical tips. Speaking the right language to your partner, friends, and co-workers can boost all these vital relationships.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:97855c33-e6c1-47bc-89e1-afd0de1b9571>"]},{"passage":"We know that you’re probably already familiar with love languages. Now, meet the five apology languages. I bet you didn’t know that there are different ways of apologizing, however, understanding your apology language can make a huge impact on your relationships. The idea of love languages and apology languages were both coined by author and radio hot Gary Chapman, Ph.D. He published the book “The Five Languages of Apology” in 2006 and lists these five languages as expressing regret, accepting responsibility, making restitution, genuinely repenting and requesting forgiveness. Take a look at our guide to the five apology languages in the gallery below, then let us know your apology language in the comments section on social media. If your apologies often start with “I’m Sorry,” then your apology language may be expressing regret. This is one of the most simple and straight forward apology languages, often going along the lines of “I’m sorry that I hurt you.” If this is your apology language, it’s important to look within and recognized the hurt you caused to the other person. If your apologies revolve around admitting what you’ve done wrong, then your apology language may be accepting responsibility. This apology language is similar to expressing regret, however, it specifically resolves around accepting wrongdoing to the other person. It often sounds like “I was wrong” or “I made a mistake.” If this is your apology language, be clear with what you’ve done wrong and keep it short yet sincere. If your apologies include phrases like “How can I make it up to you?” then your apology language may be making restitution. This apology language is all about promising an action and hopefully, delivering. It often sounds like “Let me make it up to you” or “Next time, I’ll do_____ to make sure it doesn’t happen again.” If this is your apology language, make sure you actually take action and make it up to the person you’re apologizing. If your apologies show your desire to make a change, then your apology language may be genuinely repenting. This apology language is all about verbalizing that you feel badly and want to go about things differently. It often sounds like “I wish I hadn’t done that. What can I do to not do it again?” If this is your apology language, make sure you follow up on your desire to change. If your apologies include you begging for forgiveness over asking for permission, then your apology language may be requesting forgiveness. This apology language isn’t just about begging, it’s giving the other person the time to think and process what you’ve done. It often sounds like “Can you forgive me?” or “I hope you will forgive me.” If this is your apology language, be sure not to use it as a manipulative tactic and allow the other person to make their choice on their own accord.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:0ae5f2aa-5380-490f-8e85-61365625a94f>"]},{"passage":"In these cases you contribute something else to the person you harmed. You can work it out with them to figure out what would be acceptable. You might also make restitution to show others that you are a good person. This line of thought comes from the virtue signaling ethic, and while it is great that you are doing the right thing, this is not the best way too apologize. It could lead you to think that you can just balance your bad deeds with good deeds, but this idea fails to strengthen the bonds that you have with others. Language 3: Request Forgiveness\nWhen you request forgiveness from someone you are showing them that their opinion really matters to you, and you want to rebuild the relationship that you have with them. This follows the negotiation ethic which states that you should change your social contracts in order to benefit everyone involved in them. When you request forgiveness you recognize that your actions went against the best interest of the person you wronged, and that you should have received their permission before acting. The autonomy ethic states that you should change your values in order to bolster your identity depending on each scenario. If you request forgiveness not because you care about what the other person thinks, but to avoid retribution from them, then you are following this ethic. This request for forgiveness is not a heartfelt apology because you are only thinking of yourself. Language 4: Accept Responsibility\nThe responsibility ethic states that you should change your social contracts in order to help the people you lead. When you accept the responsibility for your actions you try to manage the consequences of your actions. This shows the people that you have wronged that you still want to help them. You don't want your actions to be a burden to them. The branding ethic states that you should change your values in order to best embody the things you represent. If you take responsibility of your actions so that you can save your image this is a great thing to do, but it isn't a great apology. It shows people that you care about yourself more than the people that you harmed. Language 5: Expressing Regret\nWhen you express regret for your behavior you are being accountable to others. This follows the fifth relationship ethic which states that you must hold other people accountable for their actions by telling them how their actions have influenced others. When you express regret you tell the person you have wronged that you realize how much your actions have hurt them, and let them know that you wish you hadn't hurt them because of how much they mean to you. The self assessment ethic is the opposing ethic it states that you should evaluate your own behavior, and determine if it is actually beneficial to you. You might feel bad because you realize that your behavior is wrong and it is hurting you. But this regret is not an apology, because you don't have anyone to express it to. If you do express regret to someone because you realize that your actions are hurting yourself you will seem insincere. They will probably be like the kid with terrible drawing skills, and claim you aren't actually sorry, just sorry that your actions caught up to you. Although there are several ways to apologize, not all of the methods are necessary every time. For instance the kid whose feelings I hurt seemed to be fine after I expressed regret, and I stopped hurting his feelings. Something that I did not talk about is the relationship between personality, and apology methods. Gary Chapman's work focusses on this topic a lot, and suggests that for some people one of the apology methods will resonate with them far better than the others. One other thing that I wanted to point out is that the different apology methods are also the steps of repentance. So repentance is making an apology to God for the sins that you committed against Him. Its purpose is to initiate the rebuilding of your relationship with God. If done properly both repentance and apologizing will lead you to become a better person, and they will allow God and others to regain their trust in you.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:16d71ef5-af12-46b7-9ec7-8a325f574615>"]},{"passage":"Women apologize way too much; hey, we’re all socialized with that expectation. Because of this, one might think that when the times comes for us to say “I’m sorry” to someone who actually deserves it, we’d be rockstars at it. But unfortunately, this isn’t always the case. Saying these two little words can be quite a trying task, even when we really think we mean them and despite knowing that they’re imperative to mending and maintaining all of our relationships. Nick Hobson, director of science for PsychologyCompass and a behavioral scientist who researches emotional functioning, makes it simple with his step-by-step instructions. 1. Do it face-to-face\nAs it does most things, technology can convolute apologies too. For this reason, Hobson recommends you apologize to someone in person rather than via email, text, or even a phone call. “The sincerity in social cues will come through much more in person,” he says. “There’s far too much ambiguity in word use and tone that gets lost. It will only make things worse.” An in-person apology might be intimidating, but in the end, you owe it to them. 2. Actually mean it\nAnd, of course, for any apology to prove effective, the apologizer must be genuinely sorry for their words or actions. Fake apologies are fairly transparent, Hobson says, especially thanks to body language, tone, etc., if you’re following instruction #1. As much as not apologizing for your words and actions will weaken a relationship, a feigned apology can tank things even faster. 3. Take responsibility\nMost people love talking about themselves, so why not keep it up when saying you’re sorry? Cue the “I” statements! “The apology should include an acknowledgment of personal responsibility,” explains Hobson. “What a lot of people tend to do is offer an apology saying where they went wrong.” This will mean a lot more to a person than blaming their hurt feelings on an outside factor — or worse, on them. 4. Provide context\nThis is the one part of an apology when you’re able to explain your understanding of where things went wrong and why. But this step leaves room for some big mistakes, such as, say, sounding like you’re trying to justify or excuse your behavior. Ensure the context is about reassuring the person you hurt that you understand where you went wrong and how to prevent it from recurring — not about making yourself look better. “After explaining what happened, the person apologizing should add the important caveat that, despite the rationale, they still recognize what they did was wrong, selfish, mean, etc.,” Hobson says. 5. Make up for it\nAnyone who’s received an empty apology has been able to identify it after the fact because the person kept up their problematic behavior. “A person feeling wronged by another will be looking for some honest signal that says they’re not going to do it again,” asserts Hobson. “A key tactic, then, is to build in the apology, at the moment or shortly after, an act of generosity or kindness.” Taking the time to ensure they feel appreciated and cared for by you after breaking their trust is paramount to rebuilding your relationship.

Or longer. It will differ, as with all things human, from one person to another and from one situation to another. Many articles point out that forgiving does not mean forgetting; in a similar light accepting an apology does not equate to everything being forgiven which would suit our sometimes linear thought patterns. As an apology is an acknowledgement of wrong-doing, accepting the apology is an acknowledgement that the wrong-doer feels remorse. Phrased this way, it is all about the wrong doer; the wronged has not yet begun the journey toward mending the relationship which the wrong doer is already two steps into. It is this feeling of being behind in the process that is most difficult to manage. “I know person is sorry, why can’t I get over it?”\nBecause there are many emotions to deal with: betrayal, anger that the incident happened in the first place, fear that it will happen again, and even a sense of loss. We cannot deal with these emotions all at once, and passing one does not mean it will not circle around again at some stage in the process. Communication, perhaps ironically, is vital, not necessarily about what was done as this often leads to blame, but about what is needed. This communication is essential if the parties have different methods of dealing with conflict. Some personalities require introspection, while others need an immediate conversation. Pushing one’s own need onto the other will be counterproductive. If a contemplative, cooling off period is needed, regular phonecalls or texts may draw the process out; if increased trips to the gym are needed, suggesting a lunch date may be viewed as interfering instead of sweet. Once all the above emotions have been worked through, the decision to forgive or not can be made. As stated many times over the years by numerous articles, forgiveness is not synonymous with condoning or forgetting. Forgiving means wanting to remain in the relationship, albeit with potentially different boundaries.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:0c0fbed3-be68-4a82-a249-623dbc5a441a>"]}]}

It is early morning on the last Wednesday in August and the streets of Bunol are clean, quiet and deserted. But that won’t last for long because today is the festival of La Tomatina. When the shot from a starting pistol pierces the air at 11:00 a.m. mayhem will reign and the streets will begin to run red with the flesh and juices of ripe tomatoes being hurled at anyone who finds himself on the street. For 60 years, the town of Buñol has been home to La Tomatina which started in the forties when some friends started a tomato fight in the main square for reasons no longer known. Over the years La Tomatina has evolved into a weeklong celebration that culminates in a battle where the townspeople (and over 20 thousand tourists from around the world) pelt each other with ripe tomatoes brought in by the truck loads specifically for this event. The days leading up to the short but epic battle are filled with parades, fireworks, food and street parties. Then, early Wednesday morning, shopkeepers and business owners along the Plaza start covering windows and doors in preparation for the messy battle. Large trucks rumble up the cobblestone streets, arriving in the crowd-filled square and, from the back of these huge trucks, official instigators begin the tomato tirade by pelting the awaiting warriors with their vegetable cargo: sloppy, squishy tomatoes from the four corners of Spain. The revelers take up the battle call and about a half an hour and 150,000 tomatoes later everyone reconciles with their former targets and heads to the river to clean up.

Valencia, on the east coast of Spain, is a sunny Mediterranean city famous for its long sandy beaches and delicious oranges. Buñol, another city nearby located just 30 miles away in the same province is also very famous for its produce, particularly for its tomatoes. The curious thing, however, is that the small town’s notoriety does not stem from the quality of its tomatoes but rather their interesting custom of “bathing” in it. Buñol is famous around the globe for its “La Tomatina” festival which is essentially the world’s largest tomato fight. The famous tomato throwing battle is held once a year on the last Wednesday of August during the town’s one week festival. The Tomatina festival stared in the 1940s when a group of the town’s residents started a tomato fight in the town square. The tomato battle erupted and soon random pedestrians and other town people were drawn into the battle which culminated in a large food fight. When everything was said and done, the villagers had had such a fun time that they decided to celebrate the tomato fight the next year. From this day forward, the Tomatina festival has been an annual event, growing in size and popularity into the major tourist attraction of national interest that it is today in Spain. The town of Buñol in Valencia celebrates their patron saint for a full week with a variety of events including parades, fireworks, food stands and street parties. Paella cooking contests, wine and food are abundant as the town prepares for its famous tomato fight. As the Tomatina tomato fight approaches, the town’s Medieval bell tower is filled with tomatoes. The tomatoes are specially grown for the festival and are said to not be of food grade quality. When the last Wednesday of August arrives, shopkeepers and other business owners with establishments near the main square cover their windows and doors in preparation for the messy tomato event. The next step in La Tomatina festival is the arrival of the large trucks that slowly make their way up the cobblestone streets of Buñol filled with squishy ripe tomatoes on route to the town square where masses of people are awaiting the official start of the festival. However, before they can enter the main square, someone must overcome the test of the “palo jabón” or greasy pole. The goal is for someone to climb a large greased pole to knock the ham that is hanging on top to the ground. Meanwhile, the crowd below sings, dances and is sprayed with water from hoses. When someone achieves the feat, a fire is shot into the air and the tomato trucks enter the town square. A final shot rings out and the world’s largest tomato battle begins as the trucks offload their tomatoes into the Plaza del Pueblo. The Buñol tomato fight lasts about one hour with about 20,000 participants who generally use approximately 150,000 tomatoes, covering the whole city center and everyone nearby in red tomato sauce. After the event, fire trucks, participants and villagers work to clean the town center with hoses and abundant water. The result is actually a pristine shine to the cobblestone streets which are disinfected and thoroughly cleansed due to the acidity of the tomato sauce. The Buñol Tomatina festival is an event worth witnessing and participating in at least once in your lifetime.

The authorities frowned upon the festival until 1959 when they simply gave in to the overwhelming desire to spend a day throwing over-ripe tomatoes. In brief.... What is La Tomatina? Ivrea Orange Festival, February 25-28, 2017\nAnother popular fruit festival is the Ivrea (near Turin) three day orange-fight which involves the whole town and a bonfire in the main square. This Italian carnival started in 1808, and due to historical overtures, fancy dress plays a key part, with an extensive number of one armed Napoleonic Generals. For both events, you can fly in a private jet for the battle - fly directly into Valencia or Turin, spend a night in a local hotel and be up and ready for a fruit onslaught! After the event, lunch will be laid on at a premier restaurant and spend the afternoon taking the sights and sounds before flying back at 20:00.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:dcf6f637-edf6-49f2-b7f2-c3903ff4008a>"]}]}

Bateson 1999 Journal of Environmental Education v. 31 n. 1, p. 27-32\nThis statistical study from the Journal of Environmental Education identifies the relationship between students' attitude toward science and their attitude toward the environment. Canadian 9th grade students answered attitude question sets about the environment and about science in general. The strongest correlation identified was that students who had a positive attitude toward science also had a positive attitude toward the environment. Another correlation indicated that while students favored preservation of natural resources, they did not favor a reduction in freedom for logging companies, farmers, automobile drivers, and so on.\n\nSend the link below via email or IMCopy\nPresent to your audienceStart remote presentation\n- Invited audience members will follow you as you navigate and present\n- People invited to a presentation do not need a Prezi account\n- This link expires 10 minutes after you close the presentation\n- A maximum of 30 users can follow your presentation\n- Learn more about this feature in our knowledge base article\nDo you really want to delete this prezi?

Method of Research Used\nThe design employed by the researcher in order to carry out the purpose of the study was the descriptive and historical method. The descriptive method was used to produce more information about “what is\/ are “or the current prevailing perceptions of students regarding the topic. On the other hand, the historical method was also used. The researchers gathered the average grade of the 40 respondents for school years 2007-2010. Sources of Data\nThe respondents of the study were the students of the high school department of St. Scholastica’s Academy- Marikina. The student respondents were from the Year IV who was enrolled for the past 3-4 years up to the present school year 2010-2011 but random sampling was used. Using the simple random technique, the researchers gathered 40 senior respondents from different sections. The simple random sampling was used for this allowed the researcher to have a known probability that each elementary unit to be chosen. Data Gathering Instruments\nThe study used the following research instruments in gathering the needed data. Questionnaire. A one-page questionnaire was designed for the study. It was composed of 17 questions that aimed to satisfy the statement of the problem. The required time to complete the questionnaire was estimated to be 10 minutes. Unstructured Interview. The interview refers to a face-to-face encounter between two persons, the interviewer who asks the questions and the interviewee who gives her opinion and answer relevant to satisfy the proposed study. The questions used in the questionnaire and unstructured interview were formulated by the researcher and have gone through the validation process of their English teacher, Mrs. Menere Nasiad. Data Gathering Procedure\nThe researcher sought the permission and approval of the English teacher, Mrs. Menere Nasiad to conduct the study. When the permission and approval were granted, the questionnaire was formulated. The first draft was presented to the person above and their classmates for comments and suggestions. After which the final questions were written in black and white, photocopied and distributed to the respondents. Statistical Treatment of Data\nThe statistical techniques used in treating the data were the following: Weighted Mean. The weighted means of the responses to the questionnaire were taken. The weighted mean is used whenever the composite attitude of a group of respondents toward an issue is sought. The weighted mean is attained by multiplying the scale value of the responses indicating it and the dividing the total weighted points by the number of responses. Percentage. The percentage was used to interpret data from frequency distribution. Arithmetic Mean. The arithmetic mean was used in some items of the questionnaire. The formula is: M = Ex\nPRESENTATION, ANALYSIS, AND INTERPRETATION OF DATA\nThis chapter presents, analyzes, and interprets the data gathered from the 40 copies of a one-page survey questionnaire distributed to fourth year students of SSAM batch 2010-2011 which includes 17 questions that would help the researchers answer the questions of the proposed study. The age of the 40 students who answered the questionnaire ranges from 15-16 years old. Eighteen students were studying in SSAM for 11 years, four students were at the said school for 10 years, two for nine years in this institution, one for six years, eight for four years, five for three years, one for two years and one student did not answer the question. The researchers asked the respondents if they experienced failing a subject during their stay in the said institution and out of the 40 respondents, a total of 20 students or 50% of them experienced failing a subject since first year high school and the other 20 students or 50% did not experience failing any subject. Table 1 presents the number of students who experienced failing a subject from first year high school to third year high school.\n\nDescribe the techniques used to analyze the data, including computer software used, if appropriate. For example, ‘SPSS version X was used to analyze the data. Analysis of variance techniques was used to test the hypotheses\nEthical Consideration: Identify any particular ethical issues that were attached to this research. Provide a statement of ethics committee approval. Do not name the university or other institution from which ethics committee approval was obtained; state only that ethics committee approval was obtained from a university and\/or whatever other organization is relevant\nThe study findings should be clear and concise. If the findings present in the table or diagram, there must not be any overlap between findings shown in the table\/diagram and description that are written in the text. The tables are arranged in a row, each table should be briefly titled and placed on top of the table, the title of the table is written in capital letters at the beginning of the word, except for the foreground. The maximum number of tables in each article is 6 tables. Photos, pictures, and diagrams are arranged in sequence, and given a short title and placed on the photo\/drawing\/diagram with a maximum of 3 pieces. Describe the discussion by comparing the data obtained at this time with the data obtained in the previous study or the concept and theory. No more statistical or other mathematical symbols in the discussion. The discussion is directed at an answer to the research hypothesis. Emphasis was placed on similarities, differences, or the uniqueness of the findings obtained. It is a need to discuss the reason for the findings. The implications of the results are written to clarify the impact of the results the advancement of science is studied. The discussion ended with the various limitations of the study\nThe conclusion can be in the form of finding generalization based on the research problems. Suggestions can be in the form of input\/proposition for future researchers, or implicative recommendations from the research findings on theory, practice, and probably policy. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT (IF ANY)\nAcknowledgment is given to the funding sources of study and those who support that funding. The names of those who support or assist the study are written clearly. Names that have been mentioned as the authors of the manuscripts are not allowed here. Use APA (American Psychological Association) 6th Edition with DOI number format for citation and references.\n\nResearch Students Use One Or The Other Methods Listed Below To Attain Their Qualifying Degree\nDescriptive – Qualitative Method: It offers a detailed account of a particular situation or situations; knowledge of which is attained via interviews, reviewing the document or through observations. This method is used when the research student wants to know about people’s challenges, their perceptions and the way people implement any particular program. Descriptive Quantitative Method: Only those research papers use this method where students can measure the things in the manner they are. For example it is helpful in finding the answers of questions like- How many people attended the workshop? What are the individual characteristics of these people in workshops? How was the performance of these participants while attending the workshops? Correlational or Regression Analysis: When the quantitative analysis between two or more variables is judged based on the strength of the relationships it is called co relational analysis. For example, judging the teacher’s qualification in respect of the student’s achievement. Such a research paper uses words like correlated with, related to, associated with, less likely than, more likely than etc. Quasi-Experimental Method: This method is used to compare two groups where one receives the intervention while others do not but both have similar characteristics. In this no random assignment is used. This method analysis if the program causes any momentous differences in participant’s outcomes in contrast to those who did not participate but had same characteristics but did not receive the intervention. These research papers use phrase like “compared with’. In this results are both statistically noteworthy and meaningful. Experimental Research Method: Students write research papers with experimental research method while using random assignments. Here participants are experimented based on 2 groups where one is the experimental or treatment group and the other is the controlled or comparison group. It finds the answers of questions like- If the program created any significant variation in participant’s results in contrast to the controlled group’s outcomes. The terms like causes, lead to, denotes that, experimental methods etc. has been used. Only those results should be considered meaningful that are statistically important. Meta- Analysis Methods: This method determines the average impact of same intervention across various studies and synthesis of results from various studies performed. It is the statistical procedure where data are combined from various studies. When the treatment effect and its impact are consistent in studies and increased effect is experienced, Meta-analysis works best. Surveys: Collecting information from huge groups of people through questionnaires, interviews, and telephones belongs to this category. Questionnaires: It’s a good way to collect information from huge crowd if people don’t have time to go for the interviews or experiments. Feelings can be stated privately while students write research papers. Multiple choice questions close and open ended questions and attitude scales are used here. Interviews: Interviews can be face to face or through telephone or Skype. A formal, informal or semi-formal approach is adopted with pre-determined questions. The research methods are many and can be chosen based on the subject thesis. All what is required is sincerity while carrying the tests so that accuracy can be maintained. Experts from ThesisHelpers have more amazing ideas that will help you with academic papers.\n\nThese studies typically provide insight into the existence or lack thereof of specific relations, but not necessarily in the exact parameters in the model. To relate findings back to the larger context, field studies, proof of implementation studies and market introduction research can be conducted. Complexities of the world come back into play allowing estimation about the limits of the simplified model. A mix of quantitative and qualitative methods to explore this relation can be applied. Consumer science uses a lot of methods derived from psychological and sociological research. Observations, interviews and focus groups are qualitative methods used to identify important deliberations, ideas and thoughts of consumers. The emphasis in these methods lies on identifying and understanding consumer behaviour, rather than quantifying it. In depth interpretation of responses in order to understand logical argument structure is the key issue; while generalisation to the general population is of less importance.. The use of market data, representative surveys (questionnaires), experimental surveys, behavioural experiments (measuring behaviour), and psychophysiological responses on situations are typical quantitative methods used in consumer science. A range of statistical methods are used to describe parameters and to test whether hypothesised relations are likely in the population.\n\nThe method section captures the methods and procedures that you undertook to answer the research questions and resolve the study’s hypothesis. The section explains the procedures used to collect data as well as the techniques for data analysis, among others. In other words, the methods section explains the ways which the researcher used to identify, collect, process, and analyze data\/information for their paper. A cogent explanation of these procedures and techniques is necessary because it allows readers to critically examine the overall validity and reliability of the empirical findings of the paper. Likewise, it helps other researchers who wish to reproduce the results that you obtained. The following tips should help shed more light on how to write the methods section for a research paper\nWrite according to your field of study\nResearch methods vary according to field or discipline of study. For example, methods in the natural sciences are largely experimental and rely on laboratory data unlike the social sciences where a variety of other methods are used. Therefore, every researcher must contextualize their research methods within the norms of their field of study. You select a research design and organize your methods according to the framework of that design. If you decide to use methods that are not within the scope of your discipline, be sure to explain such methods thoroughly and also offer your reasons for using them in addition to narrating how they help solve the research problem. You have to be able to argue for why your research method is appropriate for solving your research questions or hypotheses. Ensure that your approaches are suitable for the research problem\nA serious setback in many research papers is the inappropriateness of the adopted research methods to help meet the study’s objectives. To avoid this, try and ensure that your data collection and analysis methods and your research design as a whole revolve around the identified research problem. For those working with primary data, one way of achieving this, especially when writing a dissertation, is through the use of pilot studies. If you are using secondary data for regression analysis, you can try several iterations using regression software until you arrive at suitable research methods. Note that you need to specify at least one model when using regression analysis. Explain your methodological and data collection approaches in detail\nThere are several different types of research and they can be classified in a number of ways. Thus, you have to clearly explain the approach or approaches you adopted for your paper. For example, is your research quantitative, qualitative, or mixed? Did you use primary data or secondary data? Did you collect data via observation, interviews, surveys, questionnaires? Was the data collected personally by you or posted\/mailed? Did you work with research assistants? What problems did you face during the data collection process? All the procedures you passed through to ensure that you collected valid data should be stated. If you used secondary data, specify the nature of the data and the sources you collected the data from. Rationalize your sample size\/techniques\nIf you are collecting primary data through fieldwork, then the sampling procedure is very important. First, you have to briefly discuss the target population that you have identified for your study. After this, you then talk about the sampling technique you wish to draw your subjects from. You may also have to indicate the size of the sample and why you decided to settle for that size. Note that the larger the sample size the better your chances of correctly predicting the characteristics of your target population. Hence, it is more ideal to select a large sample so as to ensure that it is representative enough of the entire population. Elaborate on your data analysis techniques\nAfter the you have completed the task of collecting data, you must then comprehensively describe the techniques through which you intend to measure and subsequently analyze the data. For example, if it is quantitative analysis, you’ll likely opt for statistical software such as ANOVA, regression, etc, and the use of computer software such as SPSS, Eviews, and others. If it is qualitative analysis, try to provide an elaborate explanation of the techniques and software used, e.g., the computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS) which can help various forms of qualitative research analysis such as grounded theory methodology, transcription analysis, coding, and text interpretation, discourse analysis, and recursive abstraction, among others. Explain the steps you took to ensure validity and reliability\nValidity and reliability are very important concepts in research that any researcher must not take for granted.\n\nResearches are carried out using different methods as in this case research survey was conducted whereby the animals under study are grouped according to their characteristics in clusters. Clusters categorization was done regarding the age of people which were divided into three groups the infants, adolescent and adults (Connor & Lawrence, 2017). Cluster as a method of research helps in giving accurate information of a small group identified. The research was also conducted by the use of questionnaires as there was the preparation of execution of cards to be used in face to face communication interview for the selected categories of thirty-three animals. Scale measurement was also applied to help conduct research selected figures to calculate estimates that can be used in graphical representation. The essential information includes the sample size which helps to determine for the size of the population under study to plan or budget for the estimated data collected. The ratio helps in the easy representation of different samples to give clear feedback on the random questionnaire. For example, in this case, the ratio of infants, adolescence and adult will be well represented in ratios from the data collected. The statistical analysis gives the conclusion on the animals on the study as in this case. Sampling is a statistical technique whereby a small number of the entire population is selected to represent a whole population of a selected group of people or animals. In this study of peer's article, a sample from three selected groups of individuals was presented. That is infants, adolescence and the adult. All the results obtained from the sample will reflect the entire nature or characteristics of the entire population. It's from the sample size where the questionnaires derived to give more information to the items under study and the statistical information is derived which will be applied in graphical representation. The design of the study tie to the objectives as this is clearly shown by the results for the three sample size selected. The dependent and independent objectives are also well described as categorized or clusters explains information the three selected areas. The difference in the posting arises. The similarity that appears in both posting that is, in both posting the study is having three sample sizes. That is according to human growth stages. The study gives details of the research methods such as surveys and questioners to explain more about the findings. The essential information was provided through sampling to prevent biases due to big data that may be ambiguous. The sampling procedure is also provided which begins from the identification of the target population, sample size selection, and data presentation. The discussion also relates the objectives of both dependent and independent variables from both discussions. Ruben Bueno-Mari, J., Oscar D. Salomon; Luis C.

This module does not attempt to introduce the many different statistical concepts and tests that have been developed, but rather provides an overview of how various statistical methods are used in science. More information about specific statistical tests and methods can be found under the Resources tab. Statistics in research design\nMany people misinterpret statements of likelihood and probability as a sign of weakness or uncertainty in scientific results. However, the use of statistical methods and probability tests in research is an important aspect of science that adds strength and certainty to scientific conclusions. For example, in 1843, John Bennet Lawes, an English entrepreneur, founded the Rothamsted Experimental Station in Hertfordshire, England to investigate the impact of fertilizer application on crop yield. Lawes was motivated to do so because he had established one of the first artificial fertilizer factories a year earlier. For the next 80 years, researchers at the Station conducted experiments in which they applied fertilizers, planted different crops, kept track of the amount of rain that fell, and measured the size of the harvest at the end of each growing season. By the turn of the century, the Station had a vast collection of data but few useful conclusions: One fertilizer would outperform another one year but underperform the next, certain fertilizers appeared to affect only certain crops, and the differing amounts of rainfall that fell each year continually confounded the experiments (Salsburg, 2001). The data were essentially useless because there were a large number of uncontrolled variables. In 1919, the Rothamsted Station hired a young statistician by the name of Ronald Aylmer Fisher to try to make some sense of the data. Fisher's statistical analyses suggested that the relationship between rainfall and plant growth was far more statistically significant than the relationship between fertilizer type and plant growth. But the agricultural scientists at the station weren't out to test for weather – they wanted to know which fertilizers were most effective for which crops. No one could remove weather as a variable in the experiments, but Fisher realized that its effects could essentially be separated out if the experiments were designed appropriately. In order to share his insights with the scientific community, Fisher published two books: Statistical Methods for Research Workers in 1925 and The Design of Experiments in 1935. By highlighting the need to consider statistical analysis during the planning stages of research, Fisher revolutionized the practice of science and transformed the Rothamsted Station into a major center for research on statistics and agriculture, which it still is today. Controls: The use of controls is based on the concept of variability. Since any phenomenon has some measure of variability, controls allow the researcher to measure natural, random, or systematic variability in a similar system and use that estimate as a baseline for comparison to the observed variable or phenomenon. At Rothamsted, a control would be a crop that did not receive the application of fertilizer (see plots labeled I in Figure 3). The variability inherent in plant growth would still produce plants of varying heights and sizes. The control then could provide a measure of the impact that weather or other variables could have on crop growth independent of fertilizer application, thus allowing the researchers to statistically remove this as a factor. Randomization: Statistical randomization helps to manage bias in scientific research. Unlike the common use of the word random, which implies haphazard or disorganized, statistical randomization is a precise procedure in which units being observed are assigned to a treatment or control group in a manner that takes into account the potential influence of confounding variables. This allows the researcher to quantify the influence of these confounding variables by observing them in both the control and treatment groups. For example, before Fisher, fertilizers were applied along different crop rows at Rothamsted, some of which fell entirely along the edge of fields. Yet edges are known to affect agricultural yield, and so it was difficult in many cases to distinguish edge effects from fertilizer effects – the edge effects would be considered a confounding variable. Fisher introduced a process of randomly assigning different fertilizers to different plots within a field in a single year while assuring that not all of the treatment (or control) plots for any particular fertilizer fell along the edge of the field (see Figure 3).\n\n### Question: What statistical analysis methods were used to examine the relationship between children's STEM interests and their friends' attitudes towards science and engineering?","passages":[{"passage":"Stem Friends: Friendships and STEM interest\nDiscovering the role that 4th and 5th-grade friendships have to play in children’s STEM interest\nMost parents understand that their child’s friendships hold great influence on their perceptions, hobbies, and interests – but today, our Data Scientist, David Meier, provides us with some interesting evidence that demonstrates how your children’s friends feel about STEM may greatly impact your own child’s STEM interest! Interesting results emerged when we analyzed data from our Camp Invention Research Project: Institute for Learning Innovation study regarding what STEM areas girls and boys enjoy learning about. Using a five-point rating scale with five being the highest, we asked 485 fourth and fifth-grade Camp Invention participants how much they liked finding out about or learning about various STEM topics. These topics were selected to measure interest in three main STEM areas: Life Science, Earth Science, and Technology and Engineering. Utilizing T-Tests, we found that the 209 girls liked finding out about Life Science more than the 276 boys (average rating of 3.69 to 3.37) and that the boys liked finding out about Technology and Engineering more than the girls (average rating of 4.18 to 3.98). While this finding may not be overly surprising to some people, what we found particularly interesting is that no statistically significant difference was found between the reported liking of finding out about Earth Science between the girls and the boys (average rating of 4.15 and 4.00). We also asked the participants to rate their agreement to the question, “My friends think science and engineering are cool.”\nUtilizing regression models, we found there to be a statistically significant and positive relationship between a participant’s friends thinking science and engineering are cool and their own enjoyment in finding out about all three of the STEM areas! Interestingly, while no difference in the average rating for liking learning about Earth Science was found between the girls and the boys, the relationship between girls’ friends thinking science and engineering is cool and their rating of liking finding out about Earth Science was stronger than for the boys. Indeed, for the girls, we found that for every one-unit increase in the rating of their friends’ thinking science and engineering is cool we could predict a corresponding increase of .21 units in their own rating of liking finding out about Earth Science (the predicted increase for the boys was .19 units). While the statistical tests we utilized don’t prove causation, their statistically significant and predictive quality provides us evidence that there definitely is a positive relationship between friends’ attitudes towards science and engineering and a child’s own enjoyment in finding out about Life Science, Earth Science, and Technology and Engineering. Parents, have you found this to be displayed in your own children’s friendships? For more information on these findings, feel free to contact Data Scientist, David Meier.

Method of Research Used\nThe design employed by the researcher in order to carry out the purpose of the study was the descriptive and historical method. The descriptive method was used to produce more information about “what is\/ are “or the current prevailing perceptions of students regarding the topic. On the other hand, the historical method was also used. The researchers gathered the average grade of the 40 respondents for school years 2007-2010. Sources of Data\nThe respondents of the study were the students of the high school department of St. Scholastica’s Academy- Marikina. The student respondents were from the Year IV who was enrolled for the past 3-4 years up to the present school year 2010-2011 but random sampling was used. Using the simple random technique, the researchers gathered 40 senior respondents from different sections. The simple random sampling was used for this allowed the researcher to have a known probability that each elementary unit to be chosen. Data Gathering Instruments\nThe study used the following research instruments in gathering the needed data. Questionnaire. A one-page questionnaire was designed for the study. It was composed of 17 questions that aimed to satisfy the statement of the problem. The required time to complete the questionnaire was estimated to be 10 minutes. Unstructured Interview. The interview refers to a face-to-face encounter between two persons, the interviewer who asks the questions and the interviewee who gives her opinion and answer relevant to satisfy the proposed study. The questions used in the questionnaire and unstructured interview were formulated by the researcher and have gone through the validation process of their English teacher, Mrs. Menere Nasiad. Data Gathering Procedure\nThe researcher sought the permission and approval of the English teacher, Mrs. Menere Nasiad to conduct the study. When the permission and approval were granted, the questionnaire was formulated. The first draft was presented to the person above and their classmates for comments and suggestions. After which the final questions were written in black and white, photocopied and distributed to the respondents. Statistical Treatment of Data\nThe statistical techniques used in treating the data were the following: Weighted Mean. The weighted means of the responses to the questionnaire were taken. The weighted mean is used whenever the composite attitude of a group of respondents toward an issue is sought. The weighted mean is attained by multiplying the scale value of the responses indicating it and the dividing the total weighted points by the number of responses. Percentage. The percentage was used to interpret data from frequency distribution. Arithmetic Mean. The arithmetic mean was used in some items of the questionnaire. The formula is: M = Ex\nPRESENTATION, ANALYSIS, AND INTERPRETATION OF DATA\nThis chapter presents, analyzes, and interprets the data gathered from the 40 copies of a one-page survey questionnaire distributed to fourth year students of SSAM batch 2010-2011 which includes 17 questions that would help the researchers answer the questions of the proposed study. The age of the 40 students who answered the questionnaire ranges from 15-16 years old. Eighteen students were studying in SSAM for 11 years, four students were at the said school for 10 years, two for nine years in this institution, one for six years, eight for four years, five for three years, one for two years and one student did not answer the question. The researchers asked the respondents if they experienced failing a subject during their stay in the said institution and out of the 40 respondents, a total of 20 students or 50% of them experienced failing a subject since first year high school and the other 20 students or 50% did not experience failing any subject. Table 1 presents the number of students who experienced failing a subject from first year high school to third year high school.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:c499ce6c-6b32-43f2-878e-6b786a3cfc94>"]},{"passage":"Describe the techniques used to analyze the data, including computer software used, if appropriate.

This method is used when the research student wants to know about people’s challenges, their perceptions and the way people implement any particular program. Descriptive Quantitative Method: Only those research papers use this method where students can measure the things in the manner they are. For example it is helpful in finding the answers of questions like- How many people attended the workshop? What are the individual characteristics of these people in workshops? How was the performance of these participants while attending the workshops? Correlational or Regression Analysis: When the quantitative analysis between two or more variables is judged based on the strength of the relationships it is called co relational analysis. For example, judging the teacher’s qualification in respect of the student’s achievement. Such a research paper uses words like correlated with, related to, associated with, less likely than, more likely than etc. Quasi-Experimental Method: This method is used to compare two groups where one receives the intervention while others do not but both have similar characteristics. In this no random assignment is used. This method analysis if the program causes any momentous differences in participant’s outcomes in contrast to those who did not participate but had same characteristics but did not receive the intervention. These research papers use phrase like “compared with’. In this results are both statistically noteworthy and meaningful. Experimental Research Method: Students write research papers with experimental research method while using random assignments. Here participants are experimented based on 2 groups where one is the experimental or treatment group and the other is the controlled or comparison group. It finds the answers of questions like- If the program created any significant variation in participant’s results in contrast to the controlled group’s outcomes. The terms like causes, lead to, denotes that, experimental methods etc. has been used. Only those results should be considered meaningful that are statistically important. Meta- Analysis Methods: This method determines the average impact of same intervention across various studies and synthesis of results from various studies performed. It is the statistical procedure where data are combined from various studies. When the treatment effect and its impact are consistent in studies and increased effect is experienced, Meta-analysis works best. Surveys: Collecting information from huge groups of people through questionnaires, interviews, and telephones belongs to this category. Questionnaires: It’s a good way to collect information from huge crowd if people don’t have time to go for the interviews or experiments. Feelings can be stated privately while students write research papers. Multiple choice questions close and open ended questions and attitude scales are used here. Interviews: Interviews can be face to face or through telephone or Skype. A formal, informal or semi-formal approach is adopted with pre-determined questions. The research methods are many and can be chosen based on the subject thesis. All what is required is sincerity while carrying the tests so that accuracy can be maintained.

To relate findings back to the larger context, field studies, proof of implementation studies and market introduction research can be conducted. Complexities of the world come back into play allowing estimation about the limits of the simplified model. A mix of quantitative and qualitative methods to explore this relation can be applied. Consumer science uses a lot of methods derived from psychological and sociological research. Observations, interviews and focus groups are qualitative methods used to identify important deliberations, ideas and thoughts of consumers. The emphasis in these methods lies on identifying and understanding consumer behaviour, rather than quantifying it. In depth interpretation of responses in order to understand logical argument structure is the key issue; while generalisation to the general population is of less importance.. The use of market data, representative surveys (questionnaires), experimental surveys, behavioural experiments (measuring behaviour), and psychophysiological responses on situations are typical quantitative methods used in consumer science. A range of statistical methods are used to describe parameters and to test whether hypothesised relations are likely in the population.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:b7310edf-f0f4-421b-a0fb-05e30ee46662>"]},{"passage":"The method section captures the methods and procedures that you undertook to answer the research questions and resolve the study’s hypothesis. The section explains the procedures used to collect data as well as the techniques for data analysis, among others. In other words, the methods section explains the ways which the researcher used to identify, collect, process, and analyze data\/information for their paper. A cogent explanation of these procedures and techniques is necessary because it allows readers to critically examine the overall validity and reliability of the empirical findings of the paper. Likewise, it helps other researchers who wish to reproduce the results that you obtained. The following tips should help shed more light on how to write the methods section for a research paper\nWrite according to your field of study\nResearch methods vary according to field or discipline of study. For example, methods in the natural sciences are largely experimental and rely on laboratory data unlike the social sciences where a variety of other methods are used. Therefore, every researcher must contextualize their research methods within the norms of their field of study. You select a research design and organize your methods according to the framework of that design. If you decide to use methods that are not within the scope of your discipline, be sure to explain such methods thoroughly and also offer your reasons for using them in addition to narrating how they help solve the research problem. You have to be able to argue for why your research method is appropriate for solving your research questions or hypotheses. Ensure that your approaches are suitable for the research problem\nA serious setback in many research papers is the inappropriateness of the adopted research methods to help meet the study’s objectives. To avoid this, try and ensure that your data collection and analysis methods and your research design as a whole revolve around the identified research problem. For those working with primary data, one way of achieving this, especially when writing a dissertation, is through the use of pilot studies. If you are using secondary data for regression analysis, you can try several iterations using regression software until you arrive at suitable research methods. Note that you need to specify at least one model when using regression analysis. Explain your methodological and data collection approaches in detail\nThere are several different types of research and they can be classified in a number of ways. Thus, you have to clearly explain the approach or approaches you adopted for your paper. For example, is your research quantitative, qualitative, or mixed? Did you use primary data or secondary data? Did you collect data via observation, interviews, surveys, questionnaires? Was the data collected personally by you or posted\/mailed? Did you work with research assistants? What problems did you face during the data collection process? All the procedures you passed through to ensure that you collected valid data should be stated. If you used secondary data, specify the nature of the data and the sources you collected the data from. Rationalize your sample size\/techniques\nIf you are collecting primary data through fieldwork, then the sampling procedure is very important. First, you have to briefly discuss the target population that you have identified for your study. After this, you then talk about the sampling technique you wish to draw your subjects from. You may also have to indicate the size of the sample and why you decided to settle for that size. Note that the larger the sample size the better your chances of correctly predicting the characteristics of your target population. Hence, it is more ideal to select a large sample so as to ensure that it is representative enough of the entire population. Elaborate on your data analysis techniques\nAfter the you have completed the task of collecting data, you must then comprehensively describe the techniques through which you intend to measure and subsequently analyze the data. For example, if it is quantitative analysis, you’ll likely opt for statistical software such as ANOVA, regression, etc, and the use of computer software such as SPSS, Eviews, and others. If it is qualitative analysis, try to provide an elaborate explanation of the techniques and software used, e.g., the computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS) which can help various forms of qualitative research analysis such as grounded theory methodology, transcription analysis, coding, and text interpretation, discourse analysis, and recursive abstraction, among others. Explain the steps you took to ensure validity and reliability\nValidity and reliability are very important concepts in research that any researcher must not take for granted.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:072192cc-072f-44bd-bbdb-72c2f3585bf2>"]},{"passage":"Researches are carried out using different methods as in this case research survey was conducted whereby the animals under study are grouped according to their characteristics in clusters. Clusters categorization was done regarding the age of people which were divided into three groups the infants, adolescent and adults (Connor & Lawrence, 2017). Cluster as a method of research helps in giving accurate information of a small group identified. The research was also conducted by the use of questionnaires as there was the preparation of execution of cards to be used in face to face communication interview for the selected categories of thirty-three animals. Scale measurement was also applied to help conduct research selected figures to calculate estimates that can be used in graphical representation. The essential information includes the sample size which helps to determine for the size of the population under study to plan or budget for the estimated data collected. The ratio helps in the easy representation of different samples to give clear feedback on the random questionnaire. For example, in this case, the ratio of infants, adolescence and adult will be well represented in ratios from the data collected. The statistical analysis gives the conclusion on the animals on the study as in this case. Sampling is a statistical technique whereby a small number of the entire population is selected to represent a whole population of a selected group of people or animals. In this study of peer's article, a sample from three selected groups of individuals was presented. That is infants, adolescence and the adult. All the results obtained from the sample will reflect the entire nature or characteristics of the entire population.

This module does not attempt to introduce the many different statistical concepts and tests that have been developed, but rather provides an overview of how various statistical methods are used in science. More information about specific statistical tests and methods can be found under the Resources tab. Statistics in research design\nMany people misinterpret statements of likelihood and probability as a sign of weakness or uncertainty in scientific results. However, the use of statistical methods and probability tests in research is an important aspect of science that adds strength and certainty to scientific conclusions. For example, in 1843, John Bennet Lawes, an English entrepreneur, founded the Rothamsted Experimental Station in Hertfordshire, England to investigate the impact of fertilizer application on crop yield. Lawes was motivated to do so because he had established one of the first artificial fertilizer factories a year earlier. For the next 80 years, researchers at the Station conducted experiments in which they applied fertilizers, planted different crops, kept track of the amount of rain that fell, and measured the size of the harvest at the end of each growing season. By the turn of the century, the Station had a vast collection of data but few useful conclusions: One fertilizer would outperform another one year but underperform the next, certain fertilizers appeared to affect only certain crops, and the differing amounts of rainfall that fell each year continually confounded the experiments (Salsburg, 2001). The data were essentially useless because there were a large number of uncontrolled variables. In 1919, the Rothamsted Station hired a young statistician by the name of Ronald Aylmer Fisher to try to make some sense of the data. Fisher's statistical analyses suggested that the relationship between rainfall and plant growth was far more statistically significant than the relationship between fertilizer type and plant growth. But the agricultural scientists at the station weren't out to test for weather – they wanted to know which fertilizers were most effective for which crops. No one could remove weather as a variable in the experiments, but Fisher realized that its effects could essentially be separated out if the experiments were designed appropriately. In order to share his insights with the scientific community, Fisher published two books: Statistical Methods for Research Workers in 1925 and The Design of Experiments in 1935. By highlighting the need to consider statistical analysis during the planning stages of research, Fisher revolutionized the practice of science and transformed the Rothamsted Station into a major center for research on statistics and agriculture, which it still is today. Controls: The use of controls is based on the concept of variability. Since any phenomenon has some measure of variability, controls allow the researcher to measure natural, random, or systematic variability in a similar system and use that estimate as a baseline for comparison to the observed variable or phenomenon. At Rothamsted, a control would be a crop that did not receive the application of fertilizer (see plots labeled I in Figure 3). The variability inherent in plant growth would still produce plants of varying heights and sizes. The control then could provide a measure of the impact that weather or other variables could have on crop growth independent of fertilizer application, thus allowing the researchers to statistically remove this as a factor. Randomization: Statistical randomization helps to manage bias in scientific research. Unlike the common use of the word random, which implies haphazard or disorganized, statistical randomization is a precise procedure in which units being observed are assigned to a treatment or control group in a manner that takes into account the potential influence of confounding variables. This allows the researcher to quantify the influence of these confounding variables by observing them in both the control and treatment groups. For example, before Fisher, fertilizers were applied along different crop rows at Rothamsted, some of which fell entirely along the edge of fields. Yet edges are known to affect agricultural yield, and so it was difficult in many cases to distinguish edge effects from fertilizer effects – the edge effects would be considered a confounding variable. Fisher introduced a process of randomly assigning different fertilizers to different plots within a field in a single year while assuring that not all of the treatment (or control) plots for any particular fertilizer fell along the edge of the field (see Figure 3).","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:a5b9e4a3-5076-482b-9a19-6528bd533ad8>"]}]}

The long term aim is to boost processing speeds and data storage densities by several orders of magnitude and take the information technology industry into a new era, combining greatly improved performance with dramatically lower energy consumption.\nThe phenomenon of “fast and slow” light arises from the dispersion of electromagnetic waves when they interact with, and travel through, a physical medium such as a crystal. This can have the effect of slowing down the light pulses, or on occasions appearing to cause local acceleration. These speed variations have the potential for developing purely optical devices using just electromagnetic radiation, rather than electrical signals, to store and process information. In the more immediate future, these properties will be used to enhance existing hybrid communication systems combining electronic and photonic (light-based) devices. But first more fundamental research is needed, and the current state of play along with a roadmap for future projects was discussed at a recent workshop organised by the European Science Foundation (ESF).\nThe project achieved its main objectives of reviewing the state of the art, highlighting possible applications, and gathering a dispersed European community of scientists, according to the workshop’s convenor Marco Santagiustina. “There were two remarkable highlights: slow and fast light research has immense potential in applications like microwave and millimeter wave photonics, and secondly such applications can be targeted by making progress in a selected set of technologies,” said Santagiustina.\nLight signals are already used for communication over fibre optic cables, but cannot yet be stored directly, or used for computation. This would require slowing down the light signals so that they can be buffered within a small area, and can be achieved by exploiting “fast and slow” light effects. Before the arrival of true photonic computing, there is the more immediate prospect of building optical interconnects for example in communication networks, which would reduce latency, the time taken for signals to travel from source to destination. Latency imposed by the communications network has become a significant problem in an age of globalisation where computers in different continents are cooperating in tasks that need to be executed very quickly in fractions of a second.\nAnother more immediate application of “fast and slow” light is likely to come from the ability in processing ultrawide band microwave signals, for radio communications, both for mobile telephony and wireless LANs. “Fast and slow” light can be harnessed to transmit radio frequencies directly over fibre, making it easier, cheaper, and more efficient to connect up base stations or wireless access points. “Radio over fiber is an existing application field destined to grow in the near future,” said Santagiustina. “This field will also represent a significant step forward for the photonic\/electronic convergence. In that area the time-delay\/phase-shift provided by slow and fast light devices can yield unprecedented functions.”\nSome of these functions have not yet been conceived, but the fundamental point is that converging photonics with electronics reduces delays and increases the bandwidth available, cutting costs and boosting communications capacity.","question_category":"Comparison","question_category_desc":"A question that compares the information in the document to other studies, perspectives, or contexts","user_category":"Expert","user_category_desc":"A specialized user with deep understanding of the subject matter","question":"How do the storage capabilities of optical computing systems based on 'fast and slow' light compare to current electronic storage methods?","gold":"Currently, light signals cannot yet be stored directly or used for computation, despite being used for communication over fiber optic cables. To achieve storage, light signals would need to be slowed down so they can be buffered within a small area, which could be accomplished by exploiting 'fast and slow' light effects. The long-term goal is to boost processing speeds and data storage densities by several orders of magnitude while dramatically lowering energy consumption compared to current electronic systems.","answer":"Optical computing systems based on \"fast and slow\" light have the potential to significantly enhance storage capabilities compared to current electronic storage methods. Here's how:\n\n1. **Density**: Optical storage systems can store data in three dimensions (3D) within the volume of a medium, unlike electronic storage which is typically two-dimensional (2D) on the surface of a medium. This volumetric storage allows for much higher data densities. For instance, holographic data storage (HDS), which uses \"fast and slow\" light principles, can store up to 3.9 terabytes of information in a single disc, which is 6,000 times the capacity of a CD-ROM.\n\n2. **Speed**: Optical data storage and retrieval can be much faster than electronic storage. Light travels at a speed of approximately 300,000 kilometers per second, allowing for rapid access times. Additionally, optical systems can potentially read and write data simultaneously, further enhancing speed.\n\n3. **Durability**: Optical storage media are less susceptible to damage from physical shocks and environmental factors like heat and humidity compared to electronic storage devices. This can lead to longer storage lifetimes and reduced data loss risks.\n\n4. **Access Time**: In optical systems, data can be accessed randomly, which means any piece of data can be retrieved quickly, regardless of its location. This is particularly beneficial for applications requiring rapid access to large datasets.\n\n5. **Scalability**: As optical storage technologies advance, they offer the potential for exponential growth in storage capacity, potentially outpacing the rate at which electronic storage technologies are improving.\n\n6. **Energy Efficiency**: Optical storage systems can be more energy-efficient. They do not suffer from the same heat generation issues as electronic storage, which can lead to significant energy savings over time.\n\n7. **Data Integrity**: Optical storage can offer better data integrity over time. The physical nature of data storage (e.g., pits and bumps on a disc) can be less prone to corruption than the magnetic or electrical states used in electronic storage.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while the theoretical advantages of optical computing systems based on \"fast and slow\" light are compelling, practical implementation challenges remain. These include the development of materials and technologies that can efficiently manipulate light for storage and retrieval, as well as the integration of these systems with existing electronic infrastructure. Nonetheless, ongoing research and development suggest that optical storage technologies could play a crucial role in addressing the future storage needs of data-intensive applications.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: European light research opens door for optical storage and computing\nThe goal of replacing electronics with optics for processing data in computers is coming closer through cutting edge European research into the mysterious properties of “fast and slow” light. The long term aim is to boost processing speeds and data storage densities by several orders of magnitude and take the information technology industry into a new era, combining greatly improved performance with dramatically lower energy consumption. The phenomenon of “fast and slow” light arises from the dispersion of electromagnetic waves when they interact with, and travel through, a physical medium such as a crystal. This can have the effect of slowing down the light pulses, or on occasions appearing to cause local acceleration. These speed variations have the potential for developing purely optical devices using just electromagnetic radiation, rather than electrical signals, to store and process information. In the more immediate future, these properties will be used to enhance existing hybrid communication systems combining electronic and photonic (light-based) devices. But first more fundamental research is needed, and the current state of play along with a roadmap for future projects was discussed at a recent workshop organised by the European Science Foundation (ESF). The project achieved its main objectives of reviewing the state of the art, highlighting possible applications, and gathering a dispersed European community of scientists, according to the workshop’s convenor Marco Santagiustina. “There were two remarkable highlights: slow and fast light research has immense potential in applications like microwave and millimeter wave photonics, and secondly such applications can be targeted by making progress in a selected set of technologies,” said Santagiustina. Light signals are already used for communication over fibre optic cables, but cannot yet be stored directly, or used for computation. This would require slowing down the light signals so that they can be buffered within a small area, and can be achieved by exploiting “fast and slow” light effects. Before the arrival of true photonic computing, there is the more immediate prospect of building optical interconnects for example in communication networks, which would reduce latency, the time taken for signals to travel from source to destination. Latency imposed by the communications network has become a significant problem in an age of globalisation where computers in different continents are cooperating in tasks that need to be executed very quickly in fractions of a second. Another more immediate application of “fast and slow” light is likely to come from the ability in processing ultrawide band microwave signals, for radio communications, both for mobile telephony and wireless LANs. “Fast and slow” light can be harnessed to transmit radio frequencies directly over fibre, making it easier, cheaper, and more efficient to connect up base stations or wireless access points. “Radio over fiber is an existing application field destined to grow in the near future,” said Santagiustina. “This field will also represent a significant step forward for the photonic\/electronic convergence. In that area the time-delay\/phase-shift provided by slow and fast light devices can yield unprecedented functions.”\nSome of these functions have not yet been conceived, but the fundamental point is that converging photonics with electronics reduces delays and increases the bandwidth available, cutting costs and boosting communications capacity.\n\nOptical computing is an inherently multidisciplinary subject whose study routinely involves a spectrum of expertise that threads optical physics, materials science, optical engineering, electrical engineering, computer architecture, computer programming, and computer theory. Applying ideas from theoretical computer science, such as analysis of algorithms and computational complexity, enables us to place optical computing in a framework where we can try to answer a number of important questions. For example,which problems are optical computers suitable for solving? Also, how does the resource usage on optical computers compare with more standard (e.g. digital electronic) architectures? The physical principles behind some efficiencies in optical computing are outlined here. 1. Fan-in efficiency\nKirchoff’s Law is well understood in analog electronics as a natural and constant time means of summing the current at the intersection of an arbitrary number of wires. In optics, the same thing is possible by directing several light beams towards a point detector with a linear response to incident light. Such an optical arrangement sums n non-negative integers in O(1) addition steps. On a model of a sequential digital electronic computer this would require n − 1 addition operations and even many typical (bounded fan-in)parallel models, with n or more processors, take O(log n) time steps. Tasks that rely on scalar summation operations (such as matrix multiplication) would benefit greatly from an optical implementation of the scalar sum operation. Similarly, O(1) multiplication and O(1) convolution operations can be realised optically. Very recently, an optics-based digital signal processing platform has been marketed that claims digital processing speeds of tera (10^12) operations per second. 2. Efficiency in interconnection complexity\nAs optical pathways can cross in free space without measurable effect on the information in either channel, high interconnection densities are possible with optics. Architectures with highly parallel many-to-many interconnections between parallel surfaces have already been proposed for common tasks such as sorting. Currently, intrachip, inter-chip, and inter-board connections are being investigated for manufacturing feasibility. 3. Energy efficiency\nElectrical wires suffer from induced noise and heat, which increases dramatically whenever wires are made thinner or placed closer together, or whenever the data throughput is increased. As a direct consequence of their resistance free pathways and noise-reduced environments, optical systems have the potential to generate less waste heat and so consume less energy per computation step than electronic systems. This has beend emonstrated experimentally with general purpose digital optical processors.\n\nWith technologies such as high definition television (HDTV) and video-on-demand on the horizon, the need to store colossal amounts of information in as small a space as possible is becoming more and more pressing. Digital high definition television (HDTV) will produce images with four times the resolution of conventional TV. Each frame will contain 20 megabits of data, enough to fill a couple of standard 3.5-inch floppy discs. So while eight hours of today’s analogue TV can be stored on a single video cassette, HDTV lasting the same time will consume 30 million megabits of data storage space. Quantities of data this large are usually counted in terabits, where 1 terabit is a million megabits. In future, computers will have to handle terabits with ease, but today’s data storage systems cannot cope with such huge volumes. So scientists are working on better ways to store and retrieve information so that more data can be held in a smaller space and computers can find and download it more quickly. Among the fastest storage devices for downloading information today use optical technology. There is a good chance that you already use an optical data storage system. A compact disc stores digital information as a series of holes and spaces on its surface, and they are read by a laser beam that is reflected off them. Compact discs used to store computer data rather than music are known as CD-ROMs. They hold up to 4 gigabits, or about 400 times as much information as floppy discs, and can access it two and a half times …\nOffer ends 07\/09\/2022. *Cancel anytime within 14 days of payment to receive a refund on unserved issues.

The technique shatters previous records and could prove very useful in developing faster and highly-efficient quantum and optical computers. The switch to photonics\nToday's technologies use semiconductor-based processors and storage devices to compute and store data electronically. However, with data being increasingly transmitted in the optical regime (e.g. through fiber optics), switching to all-optical components is appearing more and more like an appealing prospect. Photons are much harder to interact with and manipulate than electrons, but if this hurdle can be cleared, switching from electronics to a photonics ecosystem would bring about many key advantages. Electronic components dissipate a large portion of energy as heat, whereas in photonics components losses are very limited. Optical storage and computation would also be resistant to radiation, have a much higher transmission bandwidth, and allow for the manipulation of a single photon at a time, which would translate into better performance at a tiny fraction of the energy cost. \"Although classical data storage already offers very high read\/write rates, optical data storage has the potential to be much faster,\" Georg Heinze, who was part of the research team, told Gizmag. \"If everything operates in the optical regime there is no need to convert optical pulses in electronic signals and vice versa.\" Bringing light to a halt\nTo store data in a photonics device, the researchers use a technique known as electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). EIT consists of firing a laser \"control beam\" at a crystal which contains ions of the element praseodymium. The laser triggers a quantum reaction in the crystal that has two contemporary effects. First, it makes this normally opaque crystal transparent over a narrow spectrum; and secondly, it changes the refractive index of the crystal dramatically, slowing the incoming light pulse down to a complete halt. At this point, the researchers fire a second laser beam (containing the information to be stored) at the crystal. At the precise moment in which the laser beam carrying the information is crossing the temporarily transparent crystal, the control beam is turned off, trapping light and information inside the now opaque crystal. The photons are converted into atomic spin excitations (or \"spin waves\"), which can be stored in the crystal until the control beam is fired again and the spin waves are turned back into light, which finally escapes the crystal. Scientists have used this technique in previous experiments, but they could only use it to store data for a few millionths of a second. This is because the spin wave is very delicate, subject to energy fluctuations that can corrupt the information it encodes. The TU Darmstadt team figured out how they could prolong this storage time significantly. Their approach was to develop an algorithm that senses the noise and applies magnetic fields and high-frequency pulses to the crystal to maintain the spin wave in its original state, so that the information is kept safe for as long as possible – up to a minute. \"In this first proof-of-principle experiment we focused on long storage times rather than on transfer rates,\" says Heinze. \"However, we showed that by image storage it is possible to increase the storage capacity of the memory, and this is very important feature for spatially multiplexed quantum memories.\" The researchers are now building on this result to try and store light for even longer periods of time (up to a week) in a more energy-efficient way while achieving higher data transfer rates. In a word of caution, however, Heinze points out that it will probably be several years before this technology is ready for commercial use, and possibly decades before all-photonics devices become the norm in consumer devices. The team's research appears on the journal Physical Review Letters.\n\nOffice: EBU3B 3212\nOffice Hours: By appointment\nThe world is overflowing with data, but existing technology for storing and moving it into a processor cannot keep up. As the onslaught continues, new technologies (like flash memory and other solid-state memories) have emerged. They offer tantalizing performance gains and they will promise to bridge the gap between big, slow, non-volatile storage and small, fast, volatile memories. As is often the case, this advance in hardware technology requires a re-evaluation of how applications manage, allocate, and use the technology. This course is will cut a swath across storage technology from silicon, electron spin, and spinning disks through hardware and operating system management layers and into applications. The goal is to gain perspective on existing approaches to storing, managing, and accessing data in contemporary technologies and understand how those techniques apply to emerging technologies. We will cover a range of topics and will focus on less conventional solutions storage problems. In particular we will discuss (at least):\nThe class will consist of student presentations and discussion. We will divide the topics in the course among the students. For each topic, the student will research the topic, select a set of readings, and present a lecture. The lectures should focus on how the underlying technologies affected the current solutions to these problems and how the approaches would change if applied to new technologies. Since some of the topics are covered in othe grad classes, we will focus on less conventional solutions to problems that arise in each area. As part of the presentation you will create a wiki page on the course wiki. You should list links to the resources you used in your investigation, so that others can go poke around if they are interested. The wiki is hosted here. You will need a google account.

Clearly a new storage paradigm is needed to meet the growing storage demands. So what is it going to be?With its omnipresent computer, all connected via the internet, the information age has led to an explosion of information available to users. The decreasing cost of storing data and the increasing storage capability of the same small device footprint have been key enablers of this revolution. While current storage needs are being met, storage technology must continue to improve in order to keep pace with the rapidly increasing demand. So how is it going to be?Both magnetic and conventional optical data storage technologies, where individual bits are stored as distinct magnetic or optical changes on the surface of a recording medium are approaching physical limits beyond which individual bits may be too small or too difficult to store. So what next step is going to be?Storing information throughout the volume of a medium, not just on its surface is an intriguing solution to our entire problem regarding storage. So this is it, Holographic Data Storage. Holographic Data Storage is a volumetric approach which, although conceived decades ago, has made recent progress towards practicality with the appearance of lower-cost enabling technologies, significant results from longstanding research efforts and progress in holographic recording materials.This is a quest to find the answer to these entire questions, the technology and the story behind the next revolution in data storage. Advantages of HVD\n1. Resistance to damage - If some parts of the medium are damaged, all information can still be obtained from other parts. 2. Efficient retrieval - All information can be retrieved from any part of the medium. 3. These discs have the capacity to hold up to 3.9 terabyte (TB) of information, which is approximately 6,000 times the capacity of a CDROM, 830 times the capacity of a DVD, 160 times the capacity of single-layer Blu-ray-Discs, and about 48 times the capacity of standard computer hard drives. 4. The HVD also has a transfer rate of 1 gigabit\/s. 5. While reading a page the entire page of data can be retrieved quickly and at one time .\n\nA microscopic device for storing light developed by researchers at Cornell University could help free up bottlenecks in optical communications and computing. This could potentially improve computer and communications speeds by an order of magnitude. The new device relies on an optically controlled “gate” that can be opened and closed to trap and release light. Temporarily storing light pulses could make it possible to control the order in which bits of information are sent, as well as the timing, both of which are essential for routing communications via fiber optics. Today, such routing is done, for the most part, electronically, a slow and inefficient process that requires converting light pulses into electrons and back again. In computers, optical memory could also make possible optical communication between devices on computer chips. Switching to optical routing has been a challenge because pulses of light, unlike electrons, are difficult to control. One way to slow down the pulses and control their movement would be to temporarily confine them to a small continuous loop. (See “Tiny Device Stores Light.”) But the problem with this approach is getting the light in and out of such a trap, since any entry point will also serve as an exit that would allow light to escape. What’s needed is a way to close the entryway once the light has entered, and to do so very quickly–in less time than it takes for the light to circle around the loop and escape. Later, when the light pulse is needed, the entryway could be opened again. The Cornell researchers, led by Michal Lipson, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the university, use a very fast, 1.5-picosecond pulse of light to open and close the entryway. The Cornell device includes two parallel silicon tracks, each 560 nanometers wide. Between these two tracks, and nearly touching them, are two silicon rings spaced a fraction of the width of a hair apart. To trap the light in these rings, the researchers turned to some of their earlier work, in which they found that the rings can be tuned to detour different colors by shining a brief pulse of light on them. Light of a certain color passes along the silicon track, takes a detour through one of the rings, and then rejoins the silicon track and continues on its way. However, if the rings are retuned to the same frequency the moment after a light pulse enters a ring, the light pulse will circulate between the rings in a continuous loop rather than rejoin the silicon track and escape. Tuning the rings to different frequencies again, such as by shining another pulse on one of the rings, allows the light to escape this circuit and continue on to its destination. Work remains to be done before such a device will function in a commercial system. So far, the rings only capture part of a pulse of light. As a result, any information encoded in the shape of the overall pulse is lost. This can be solved by compressing the pulse and using a cascade of rings, says Mehmet Yanik, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT. The other issue is that the length of time a light pulse can be stored is relatively short, Lipson says. If the light stays in the ring for too long, it will be too weak to use. Lipson says it might be possible to make up for light losses by amplifying the light signal after it leaves the rings to restore any lost power. Other schemes for storing light have been demonstrated in the past, but these were impractical, requiring carefully controlled conditions, for example, or a large, complicated system. The new approach is an important step forward because it makes it possible to store light in ambient conditions and in a very small device, says Marin Soljacic, a professor of physics at MIT. Once you’ve done that, he says, “then it becomes interesting to industry.”\n\nThis item is available under a Creative Commons License for non-commercial use only\nIn today's information age demand for ultra-fast information transfer with ultra-high bandwidths has reached extraordinary levels. Hence, the transmission in the future internet-backbone will be increasingly constrained in the network nodes. At the same time, the power consumption of the network systems will increase to unsustainable levels. Nowadays, optical signal processing and switching can be implemented relatively easily. However, the realization of optical bu ers and short-term memories is still an unsolved challenge. The slow- and fast-light e ect has been investigated as one solution for the optical bu ering over the last few years. It means the slowing down and acceleration of the group velocity of light pulses in a medium. To realize this, many di erent methods and material systems have been developed but due to its signi cant advantages the nonlinear e ect of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) is particularly promising. However, it also su ers from disadvantages which limit the slow- and fast-light performance. Henker, R.

For example the parts that store information and process information, are normal part. The interesting part is that fact that the connections between these parts are based off of light. These connections are faster, they use less power, and they do no loss information. One day, all of our computers will use this, and our computers will be much faster. What do you think? Tell me about it by making a comment.\n\nIn modern personal computers, most offline-storage is also used as secondary storage. The main difference between the two terms is in how these storage devices are used. Whereas secondary storage is fixed into the computer for long term use (e.g. as is usually the case with hard disk drives), offline-storage is used mainly as a transfer medium and accessed as per need only. The key advantage of off-line storage is that if there is a disaster, e.g. a fire, that destroys the computer, the off-line storage will be unaffected if it is held in a remote location. It is also a relatively cheap medium for archiving information that is rarely used. Examples of off-line storage include:\n- CD\/DVD\/DVD-RAM (optical storage systems)\n- Blu-ray disks (optical storage systems)\n- USB flash memory\/memory sticks\/SD-XD cards (sold state storage systems)\n- Removable\/external hard disk drives (magnetic storage systems). CD\/DVD disks are described as optical storage devices. Laser light is used to read data and to write data in the surface of the disk. The data is stored in ‘pits’ and ‘bumps’ on the spiral track. DVD-RAM uses a very different technology – instead of a single spiral track, they use a number of concentric tracks, which allow simultaneous read and write operations to take place. Blu-ray disks are another example of optical storage media. However, they are fundamentally different from CD\/DVDs and DVD-RAM because they use a blue laser instead of a red laser. This means that the ‘pits’ and ‘bumps’ can be much smaller, and as a result, they store up to five times more data than a normal DVD. USB flash memories, also known as memory sticks and pen drives, use solid-state technology. They usually connect to a computer through the USB port. As they are very small and lightweight, their main advantage is their suitability for transferring files between different computers. They can also be used as small back-up devices for archived files such as music or photos, for example. Digital cameras use a slightly different form of solid-state memory, known as XD (eXtreme Digital) or SD (Secure Digital) cards. The technology is the same as memory sticks. They are made up of NAND chips and, as with all solid-state memories, there are no moving parts. Removable hard disk drives are essentially HDD but can be connected to the computer using one of the USB ports. In this way, they can be used as a back-up device or as another medium for transferring files between computers.\n\n### Question: How do the storage capabilities of optical computing systems based on 'fast and slow' light compare to current electronic storage methods?","passages":[{"passage":"European light research opens door for optical storage and computing\nThe goal of replacing electronics with optics for processing data in computers is coming closer through cutting edge European research into the mysterious properties of “fast and slow” light.

EIT consists of firing a laser \"control beam\" at a crystal which contains ions of the element praseodymium. The laser triggers a quantum reaction in the crystal that has two contemporary effects. First, it makes this normally opaque crystal transparent over a narrow spectrum; and secondly, it changes the refractive index of the crystal dramatically, slowing the incoming light pulse down to a complete halt. At this point, the researchers fire a second laser beam (containing the information to be stored) at the crystal. At the precise moment in which the laser beam carrying the information is crossing the temporarily transparent crystal, the control beam is turned off, trapping light and information inside the now opaque crystal. The photons are converted into atomic spin excitations (or \"spin waves\"), which can be stored in the crystal until the control beam is fired again and the spin waves are turned back into light, which finally escapes the crystal. Scientists have used this technique in previous experiments, but they could only use it to store data for a few millionths of a second. This is because the spin wave is very delicate, subject to energy fluctuations that can corrupt the information it encodes. The TU Darmstadt team figured out how they could prolong this storage time significantly. Their approach was to develop an algorithm that senses the noise and applies magnetic fields and high-frequency pulses to the crystal to maintain the spin wave in its original state, so that the information is kept safe for as long as possible – up to a minute. \"In this first proof-of-principle experiment we focused on long storage times rather than on transfer rates,\" says Heinze. \"However, we showed that by image storage it is possible to increase the storage capacity of the memory, and this is very important feature for spatially multiplexed quantum memories.\" The researchers are now building on this result to try and store light for even longer periods of time (up to a week) in a more energy-efficient way while achieving higher data transfer rates. In a word of caution, however, Heinze points out that it will probably be several years before this technology is ready for commercial use, and possibly decades before all-photonics devices become the norm in consumer devices. The team's research appears on the journal Physical Review Letters.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:5e638db3-5eac-4f0a-9664-97b9b098e391>"]},{"passage":"Office: EBU3B 3212\nOffice Hours: By appointment\nThe world is overflowing with data, but existing technology for storing and moving it into a processor cannot keep up.

The lectures should focus on how the underlying technologies affected the current solutions to these problems and how the approaches would change if applied to new technologies. Since some of the topics are covered in othe grad classes, we will focus on less conventional solutions to problems that arise in each area.

Clearly a new storage paradigm is needed to meet the growing storage demands. So what is it going to be?With its omnipresent computer, all connected via the internet, the information age has led to an explosion of information available to users. The decreasing cost of storing data and the increasing storage capability of the same small device footprint have been key enablers of this revolution. While current storage needs are being met, storage technology must continue to improve in order to keep pace with the rapidly increasing demand. So how is it going to be?Both magnetic and conventional optical data storage technologies, where individual bits are stored as distinct magnetic or optical changes on the surface of a recording medium are approaching physical limits beyond which individual bits may be too small or too difficult to store. So what next step is going to be?Storing information throughout the volume of a medium, not just on its surface is an intriguing solution to our entire problem regarding storage. So this is it, Holographic Data Storage. Holographic Data Storage is a volumetric approach which, although conceived decades ago, has made recent progress towards practicality with the appearance of lower-cost enabling technologies, significant results from longstanding research efforts and progress in holographic recording materials.This is a quest to find the answer to these entire questions, the technology and the story behind the next revolution in data storage. Advantages of HVD\n1. Resistance to damage - If some parts of the medium are damaged, all information can still be obtained from other parts. 2. Efficient retrieval - All information can be retrieved from any part of the medium. 3.

This could potentially improve computer and communications speeds by an order of magnitude. The new device relies on an optically controlled “gate” that can be opened and closed to trap and release light. Temporarily storing light pulses could make it possible to control the order in which bits of information are sent, as well as the timing, both of which are essential for routing communications via fiber optics. Today, such routing is done, for the most part, electronically, a slow and inefficient process that requires converting light pulses into electrons and back again. In computers, optical memory could also make possible optical communication between devices on computer chips. Switching to optical routing has been a challenge because pulses of light, unlike electrons, are difficult to control. One way to slow down the pulses and control their movement would be to temporarily confine them to a small continuous loop. (See “Tiny Device Stores Light.”) But the problem with this approach is getting the light in and out of such a trap, since any entry point will also serve as an exit that would allow light to escape. What’s needed is a way to close the entryway once the light has entered, and to do so very quickly–in less time than it takes for the light to circle around the loop and escape. Later, when the light pulse is needed, the entryway could be opened again. The Cornell researchers, led by Michal Lipson, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the university, use a very fast, 1.5-picosecond pulse of light to open and close the entryway. The Cornell device includes two parallel silicon tracks, each 560 nanometers wide. Between these two tracks, and nearly touching them, are two silicon rings spaced a fraction of the width of a hair apart. To trap the light in these rings, the researchers turned to some of their earlier work, in which they found that the rings can be tuned to detour different colors by shining a brief pulse of light on them. Light of a certain color passes along the silicon track, takes a detour through one of the rings, and then rejoins the silicon track and continues on its way. However, if the rings are retuned to the same frequency the moment after a light pulse enters a ring, the light pulse will circulate between the rings in a continuous loop rather than rejoin the silicon track and escape. Tuning the rings to different frequencies again, such as by shining another pulse on one of the rings, allows the light to escape this circuit and continue on to its destination. Work remains to be done before such a device will function in a commercial system. So far, the rings only capture part of a pulse of light. As a result, any information encoded in the shape of the overall pulse is lost. This can be solved by compressing the pulse and using a cascade of rings, says Mehmet Yanik, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT. The other issue is that the length of time a light pulse can be stored is relatively short, Lipson says. If the light stays in the ring for too long, it will be too weak to use. Lipson says it might be possible to make up for light losses by amplifying the light signal after it leaves the rings to restore any lost power. Other schemes for storing light have been demonstrated in the past, but these were impractical, requiring carefully controlled conditions, for example, or a large, complicated system. The new approach is an important step forward because it makes it possible to store light in ambient conditions and in a very small device, says Marin Soljacic, a professor of physics at MIT. Once you’ve done that, he says, “then it becomes interesting to industry.”","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:905252f5-89bc-4777-bbb3-c2d9ecfebffe>"]},{"passage":"This item is available under a Creative Commons License for non-commercial use only\nIn today's information age demand for ultra-fast information transfer with ultra-high bandwidths has reached extraordinary levels.

The main difference between the two terms is in how these storage devices are used. Whereas secondary storage is fixed into the computer for long term use (e.g. as is usually the case with hard disk drives), offline-storage is used mainly as a transfer medium and accessed as per need only. The key advantage of off-line storage is that if there is a disaster, e.g. a fire, that destroys the computer, the off-line storage will be unaffected if it is held in a remote location. It is also a relatively cheap medium for archiving information that is rarely used. Examples of off-line storage include:\n- CD\/DVD\/DVD-RAM (optical storage systems)\n- Blu-ray disks (optical storage systems)\n- USB flash memory\/memory sticks\/SD-XD cards (sold state storage systems)\n- Removable\/external hard disk drives (magnetic storage systems). CD\/DVD disks are described as optical storage devices. Laser light is used to read data and to write data in the surface of the disk. The data is stored in ‘pits’ and ‘bumps’ on the spiral track. DVD-RAM uses a very different technology – instead of a single spiral track, they use a number of concentric tracks, which allow simultaneous read and write operations to take place. Blu-ray disks are another example of optical storage media. However, they are fundamentally different from CD\/DVDs and DVD-RAM because they use a blue laser instead of a red laser. This means that the ‘pits’ and ‘bumps’ can be much smaller, and as a result, they store up to five times more data than a normal DVD. USB flash memories, also known as memory sticks and pen drives, use solid-state technology. They usually connect to a computer through the USB port. As they are very small and lightweight, their main advantage is their suitability for transferring files between different computers. They can also be used as small back-up devices for archived files such as music or photos, for example. Digital cameras use a slightly different form of solid-state memory, known as XD (eXtreme Digital) or SD (Secure Digital) cards. The technology is the same as memory sticks. They are made up of NAND chips and, as with all solid-state memories, there are no moving parts. Removable hard disk drives are essentially HDD but can be connected to the computer using one of the USB ports. In this way, they can be used as a back-up device or as another medium for transferring files between computers.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:31b21142-c243-4bfe-bb68-2388c51427c6>"]}]}

In such a landscape, knowledge can’t help but fall prey to illusion, albeit an illusion that is deeply seductive, with its promise that speed can lead us to more illumination, that it is more important to react than to think deeply, that something must be attached to every bit of time. Here, we have my reading problem in a nutshell, for books insist we take the opposite position, that we immerse, slow down.”\n– David L. Ulin, The Lost Art of Reading\nNotes: Quote – Litverve. Photograph: Amoris-Causa\nView original post\nMontaigne portrait – Dali 1947\nMeditation is a rich and powerful method of study for anyone who knows how to examine his mind, and to employ it vigorously. I would rather shape my soul than furnish it. There is no exercise that is either feeble or more strenuous, according to the nature of the mind concerned, than that of conversing with one’s own thoughts. The greatest men make it their vocation, “those for whom to live is to think. – Montaigne\n“Meditation,” here, is taken to mean “cerebration,” vigorous thinking — the same practice John Dewey addressed so eloquently a few centuries later in How We Think. This conflation, at first glance, seems rather antithetical to today’s notion of meditation — a practice often mistakenly interpreted by non-practitioners as non-thinking, an emptying of one’s mind, a cultivation of cognitive passivity. In reality, however, meditation requires an active, mindful presence, a bearing witness to one’s inner experience as it unfolds. In that regard, despite the semantic evolution of the word itself, Montaigne’s actual practice of meditation was very much aligned with the modern concept and thus centuries ahead of his time, as were a great deal of his views.\nThe great majority of men and women, in ordinary times, pass through life without ever contemplating or criticising, as a whole, either their own conditions or those of the world at large. They find themselves born into a certain place in society, and they accept what each day brings forth, without any effort of thought beyond what the immediate present requires…they seek the satisfaction of the needs of the moment, without much forethought, and without considering that by sufficient effort the whole condition of their lives could be changed…It is only a few rare and exceptional men who have that kind of love toward mankind at large that makes them unable to endure patiently the general mass of evil and suffering, regardless of any relation it may have to their own lives.

It is the more necessary to consider this question, in view of the fact that many men, under the influence of science or of practical affairs, are inclined to doubt whether philosophy is anything better than innocent but useless trifling, hair-splitting distinctions, and controversies on matters concerning which knowledge is impossible.\nThe value of philosophy is, in fact, to be sought largely in its very uncertainty. The man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense, from the habitual beliefs of his age or his nation, and from convictions which have grown up in his mind without the co-operation or consent of his deliberate reason. To such a man the world tends to become definite, finite, obvious; common objects rouse no questions, and unfamiliar possibilities are contemptuously rejected. As soon as we begin to philosophize, on the contrary, we find, as we saw in our opening chapters, that even the most everyday things lead to problems to which only very incomplete answers can be given. Philosophy, though unable to tell us with certainty what is the true answer to the doubts which it raises, is able to suggest many possibilities which enlarge our thoughts and free them from the tyranny of custom. Thus, while diminishing our feeling of certainty as to what things are, it greatly increases our knowledge as to what they may be; it removes the somewhat arrogant dogmatism of those who have never travelled into the region of liberating doubt, and it keeps alive our sense of wonder by showing familiar things in an unfamiliar aspect.\n“I’ve always tried to make a home for myself, but I have not felt at home in myself.

Philosophers have thought deeply and systematically about these fundamental questions in a way that no other discipline has. As a result, philosophers can help students grapple intellectually with the questions, not only in philosophy courses but also in various interdisciplinary programs, to be discussed a bit more fully in section (3) below. 2. Contributions to an Institution’s Core Curriculum\nMany institutions have college- or university-wide course requirements for their students, typically aimed at such goals as critical thinking or logical reasoning, sensitivity to values, and awareness of global issues. Philosophy departments are strongly positioned to contribute courses and programs that further these goals. If the aim of a particular core requirement is to develop habits of careful, critical thought in students, then philosophy is especially well-suited to the realization of this aim (see the remarks under Thinking Critically in the previous section). The study of philosophy helps students to develop both their capacity and their inclination to do critical thinking. Other disciplines also help in fulfilling this function, but philosophy contributes distinctively, intensively, and extensively to a student’s ability to think critically. Many philosophy departments regularly offer a course devoted exclusively to the topic of critical thinking. Philosophy courses can also contribute admirably to curricula that stress more formal modes of logical reasoning, emphasizing the goals of quantitative literacy and symbolic reasoning. Successful courses in the disciplines of mathematics, statistics, and computer science that aim at such a goal succeed by inculcating the skills of reasoning rigorously and logically in students. Philosophy courses in formal logic focus on those skills that are common to all these disciplines. Questions of value are among the most important and most difficult questions that students face. Philosophy courses in ethics, social and political philosophy, philosophy of law, philosophy of medicine, bioethics, environmental ethics, and aesthetics prepare students to be thoughtful, discriminating, and responsible citizens. Philosophy departments standardly offer introductory ethics courses in which students are exposed both to the dominant methods for reasoning about ethical issues and to some array of contemporary moral problems. These courses aim at giving students the conceptual tools necessary for thinking in greater depth about moral problems, an appreciation for competing moral positions, and an opportunity to develop and present their own moral views. Some of the central questions that ethics courses are likely to address are: What are the relations among morality, self-interest, religion, and law? What, if any, are the basic moral rights of persons? What, if any, moral obligations do we have to other persons, animals, the environment, and future generations? No other discipline treats these questions in the same comprehensive and systematic ways. In institutions offering academic programs in law (or pre-law), business, medicine, nursing, engineering, and other professional areas, specialized courses in applied ethics such as biomedical ethics or business ethics are important service courses that can be offered by philosophy departments. Institutions with programs in education and the fine arts, including literature, will find courses in the philosophy of education and aesthetics and the philosophy of art attractive. Philosophers have made and continue to make significant contributions to ongoing debates on a number of issues that go beyond national boundaries, such as environmental pollution, global climate change, and the status of global ecosystems; global trade and national exploitation; human rights; humanitarian intervention vs. national sovereignty; war; international law; terrorism and the status of combatants and noncombatants; foreign aid and famine relief; medical experimentation in third-world countries; and the repatriation of cultural objects. 3. Relations to Other Areas of Intellectual Inquiry\nMention of global issues at the end of the previous section suggests one way in which philosophy can collaborate fruitfully with other disciplines, such as the environmental sciences, economics, political science, and law in the examination of a family of issues. In addition to interdisciplinary collaboration, philosophy can contribute to the examination of a discipline’s foundations.\n\n- Inductive reasoning is a method of logical thinking wherein broad generalizations and theories are derived from specific examples and observations. - Deductive reasoning, on the other hand, is opposite of inductive reasoning. It is the method wherein specific ideas and conclusions are derived from general statements and hypotheses. - Metaphysics is the branch or type of philosophy that focuses on finding answers to questions about nature, reality, and the physical universe. - Axiology is the type or branch of philosophy that studies fundamental values and principles. - Epistemology is the branch or type of philosophy that scrutinizes how we, people, are able to learn and understand what we know. Why Do We Study Philosophy? Philosophy in life is extremely important. Why? It is because philosophy is like a way of life. It is a way of thinking, understanding, and gaining wisdom about human life, the reality, and the world. All of us are taught about philosophy at school because it is important to study about philosophy as we grow and become adults and as we fully embrace the reality of life. Here are 10 reasons why we study philosophy:\n1) To become a person of our own\nWith philosophy, we are able to think and become a person of our own. It enables us to not become just a “yes person”, who does not know how to think and decide for himself \/ herself. It gives us the ability to think critically, especially in real life situations. With this, philosophy also takes courage to be independent and decide for the self. 2) To get ready and succeed in various fields of expertise and careers\nWhen we study philosophy, we develop many essential skills such as reading, writing, speaking, reasoning, thinking, learning, adapting, communicating, and organizing. Now, these skills are very important in the real world, especially at the workplace where we need to perform and excel. Without these skills, we will be forever stuck and dependent on our families, especially our parents. 3) To realize your own understanding of what success is\nSuccess varies in different people and through philosophy, you will be able to realize and discover the meaning of success to you. Philosophy encourages you to think deeply, confront yourself, and know the answers, especially when it comes to questions about values, success, and fulfillment. 4) To be able to get great scores in standardized exams\nPhilosophy centers on critical, analytical, and logical thinking. Therefore, philosophy helps us figure out the correct answers in standardized tests like LSAT, GRE, MCAT, and GMAT. It is because these standardized exams are filled with philosophical questions and problems. 5) To grow and become a well informed citizen\nBeing an informed citizen does not only mean watching or reading the news everyday or surfing the web every hour. Being a well informed citizen means that beyond all the information overload that we are bombarded with everyday, we are able to think critically and behave according to what and why we know. 6) To have the potential to earn higher income\nPhilosophy stimulates the mind like no other field of study. This is the reason why so-called philosophers are very intelligent people full of wisdom. Now, when we study philosophy, we are able to develop our knowledge and wisdom to prepare for the real world of working and competition. We could have the potential to earn higher income through our learnings from philosophy. 7) To gain wisdom about ethical principles and their practice in real life\nThrough philosophy, we are able to learn about ethics, life, family, work, and social principles. With these ethical principles, we can be able to think and act ethically to various types of discussions, arguments, and situations. 8) To become a valuable and effective communicator\nPhilosophy teaches us the value of communication for personal and societal growth. When we study philosophy, our communication skills are also developed and enhanced. This further enables us to become excellent communicators who express our ideas, opinions, and theories effectively and intelligently. 9) To be able to determine our chosen path\nAnalytical thinking allows us to reflect on our deepest needs, desire, and passion. Philosophy helps us become analytical thinkers who are capable to know the best career path for ourselves so that we will not be wasting our time with the wrong choice or decision. 10) To get ready for a possible career in law\nSome of us want to partake in the world of law by becoming lawyers or attorneys.\n\nPhilosophy starts with wonderment. Philosophers are prone to asking critical questions: about humankind, the world and society. Not satisfied with simple answers, philosophers will try to shed a light on these issues by looking at them from all the relevant angles. This wonderment results in a persistent demand for quality of argumentation. In their search for answers, philosophers delve deep for underlying motives and rational explanations. A philosopher’s search has no fixed end point: what is important, is the rational search for insights while continuously asking new questions. Over the centuries, our way of thinking has been influenced by great philosophers. The Philosophy programme gives you the opportunity to think through fundamental questions and their respective answers critically, and to make your own contribution to philosophical thought. In addition to a thorough historical study of philosophical texts, our programme also strongly focuses on critical reflection on contemporary issues: the explosion of science, ecological and bioethical issues, changes in the scientific worldview, etc… . A thorough study of important thinkers in history in combination with a focus on contemporary issues results in Philosophy students who learn to build arguments in a critical and autonomous manner, and who are able to contribute to contemporary and socially critical debates.\n\nWhy study Philosophy? 6 reasons of weight\nAt a time when everything must be valued according to the price that can be paid for it in the market, philosophy is increasingly cornered: it is forgotten and undervalued in the political reforms of education. Now, that does not mean that this training option has no value, on the contrary. Studying philosophy means learning skills that will hardly be developed in other disciplines. And is that There are plenty of reasons to study philosophy , shortly we learn about the nature of this source of knowledge. In the following lines we will see the most remarkable. - Related article: \"How are Psychology and Philosophy alike?\" Why study philosophy? This is a selection of those strengths that philosophy offers to those people who decide to learn from it. They are not ordered according to a certain criterion, but you can order them in your head, highlighting those that most appeal to you. If you're wondering why study philosophy , it will be very useful. 1. Offers a better scientific knowledge\nScience is a type of knowledge-gathering method that has proven to be incredibly valuable for centuries. Now, in practice, knowledge of science does not always imply interpreting the data that your research methods offer us. And is that many times we believe that scientific information is given by nature and convey an obvious meaning to anyone who knows, but this is not so. The philosophy of science it allows us to know if certain interpretations of data are adequate or not, if the research methods used allow us to draw the conclusions we want, or even if the hypotheses from which we start are defective. Thus, the training in philosophy is an excellent complement for science-based careers, on the one hand, and also allow for carving out a career as consultant science philosophers that can guide teams of researchers to review the approaches of their studies. 2.

For example: what do we live for? What can we know? What exists and what does not? How should we behave to be good?

Philosophy was born just for this: to question the most widespread beliefs, those that dominate our minds so much that we do not even consider them beliefs, but absolute truths. In this way, studying philosophy provides a rational counterpoint that makes it possible to have a different mentality, able to detect anomalies where other people can not, and that therefore makes social change possible. - Maybe it interests you: \"Are we rational or emotional beings?\" 4. It can be applied to one's life\nMany of the questions posed by philosophy have personal implications. For example, the existential crisis is not the same if you already have an experience in this field , and the same happens with doubts about how to act correctly and what kind of behaviors should be avoided. In other words, philosophical activity does not take place outside personal life; They usually merge into one thing. 5. It helps us to reinterpret the world\nPhilosophy is not exactly a form of therapy, but it does allow you to reach stimulating reflections on their own experiences, the world, personal relationships and everything that surrounds us. So, it makes it easier for us to find alternative ways of interpretation, those that satisfy us more and allow us to be happy. In the end, given that we can never have a totally objective vision of reality, it is better to direct our subjectivity towards what brings us closer to happiness and well-being. 6. It allows detecting manipulation attempts\nThe analysis of discourses is one of the areas in which philosophy is most useful.\n\nPhilosophy & The Arts\nUpdated: Mar 19\nMotivation and Example Lesson Plans\nThis blog outlines my reasons for incorporating arts into philosophy discussions and gives examples of what I have done, and what I would like to do. 1. Introduction and Aims\nIn a world of information-overload, it is paramount that we have the space to go back to basics, work out what we really think and feel, and discuss this with others in an open, accepting and questioning environment. Philosophical enquiries are already the perfect space for the rigorous, critical thinking we desperately need more of. By integrating arts activities into them, I hope to develop philosophical enquiries into spaces that also provide the perfect environment for people to express themselves, explore issues that matter, and learn creatively. I understand there to be five reasons for interleaving the arts with philosophical enquiry:\nTo encourage deep thinking about issues that matter to individuals and society;\nTo encourage emotional and embodied engagement with topics, so participants use their own sense of the world as a starting point for dialogue;\nTo help participants articulate and reflect on what they have learned through artistic practices, helping to improve their skills in these practices;\nTo provide enquiries that are more dynamic and interactive, through participants co-creating the stimuli for enquiries;\nTo allow a diversity of activities so: 1. Individuals are challenged to develop different skills. 2. We create an inclusive environment where everyone has an opportunity to do activities they feel confident in. 2. What is Philosophical Enquiry? Philosophical enquiries involve participants grappling with ideas on their own terms. This helps them to become better at reasoning, reflecting, and developing their own views on topics. My sessions include games, activities, and small and large group discussions. The role of the facilitator is to structure sessions to include these elements in a way that is fun and allows in-depth exploration of a particular topic. Facilitators also traditionally provide a stimulus which acts as a starting point for dialogue. For example, the facilitator may tell a story, which leads to a particular question from the facilitator, or which is used to provoke questions from participants. From this initial discussion, facilitators also identify ‘emergent questions’, or encourage participants to identify emergent questions - which are questions that emerge from the participants discussion. A philosophical discussions can be about almost any subject. Traditional questions concern, for example, who we are and whether we are the same person through time, how to lead a good life, and what it means for objects to exist. However, we can approach other questions philosophically, for example, what is our place in nature? how should we treat our environment? and, how should we understand social justice issues such as race and gender? Facilitators encourage participants to think about their views, why they hold them, and whether they should hold them. This helps participants to improve their critical thinking skills, encouraging participants to think independently and develop their views. Facilitators also encourage participants to understand what others believe and why, and to respond respectfully and with an open-mind. This allows participants to develop their social skills, becoming more able to understand and engage with other people’s perspective. 3. Philosophy and the Arts - A Rationale\nPhilosophical enquiry traditionally favours verbal dialogue over other methods of meaning-making. While this is a reasonable limitation in many contexts, as a facilitator I am interested in collaborating with artists to find ways of using the body and the senses to help participants explore multiple ways of understanding themselves and the world. Philosophical thinking is often thought of as the pinnacle of abstraction, but engaging exclusively in verbal exchange can lead to philosophy that gets lost in logical puzzles, combative arguments, and an over-emphasis on issues that are irrelevant to our daily lives and the world we live in. Creative practices that engage us emotionally could work together with philosophical discussions to help people express their deepest sense of the world, and help participants to develop their views and learn about how others approach the world. I understand this interaction to work two-ways - that creative practice is important for philosophical exploration and understanding and that philosophical exploration is important for making sense of creative practice, potentially improving it, and helping us integrate creative activities into our wider experience and understanding. Philosophical enquiries traditionally involve a facilitator presenting a stimulus, to which participants respond. A collaboration between philosophy and the arts provides a way to expand pedagogical technique, and include participants in the creation of the stimulus. This immersive environment both allows participants more agency over their learning, and provides further creative space. 4. Past Sessions\n4.1.\n\nThe philosophical fields of epistemology, metaphysics, and metaethics address the most basic questions about the nature of knowledge, reality, and value. In exploring concepts and methods of inquiry used by other disciplines, in taking up questions that disciplines generate about their own subject matter, and in examining the questions that are fundamental to any area of inquiry concerned with producing knowledge about the world and making value claims about that knowledge, philosophy fulfills a unique and important role as a meta-discipline. It provides a kind of understanding of the other disciplines, particularly of their presuppositions, standards of evidence, and modes of explanation, that other fields of study neither attempt nor are able to provide. The potential value of a strong philosophy department for other disciplines must not be taken, however, to suggest that philosophy programs can be appropriately absorbed into others, whether they be humanities departments or broad divisions such as those comprising the social sciences. Philosophy is methodologically distinct, and it pursues a distinct set of questions. An autonomous philosophy program is vital both for these reasons and in order to maximize the contribution that philosophers, unencumbered by the constraints, special standards, or narrower subject matter of other disciplines, can make to their colleagues and students. 4. Contributions beyond the Curriculum\nIn such areas as public service, continuing education, alumni relations, consultation, and public visibility, philosophers can excel in representing and furthering the interests of their institutions. Colleges and universities quite properly feel obligations to the communities in which they exist and the populations from which they draw their students. Philosophers can contribute greatly to fulfilling these obligations. In most communities there is much concern with a variety of public policy issues, for instance crime and punishment, welfare, medical care, environmental stewardship, and nuclear plants. Philosophers are generally competent to speak informatively on certain important aspects of these issues, particularly the normative aspects, which are often the most important. Under various different sorts of auspices many philosophers have addressed public audiences on such issues. The results have often enhanced public understanding both of the issues under discussion and of the relevance of philosophical reflection to questions of public policy. Continuing Education and Alumni Relations\nHeightened demand for classes has resulted in a new emphasis on \"continuing education” courses. These courses are designed mainly for adults over the typical college age who want enrichment or wish an extension of their post-secondary education. Often, such people want to reflect on normative issues, to discover or return to some of the perennial questions, or simply to try something new. Philosophy has much to offer them. This fact needs wider recognition by administrators, academic advisors, and philosophers themselves. In many cases, a school’s alumni would be interested in programs or short courses in philosophy. Philosophy departments can contribute significantly to satisfying the needs of alumni and many others above the usual college age, whether they seek mainly the intellectual enrichment of philosophy or some of the conceptual and other general skills that the study of philosophy can help to develop. Many philosophers have been consultants to institutions, agencies, businesses, and the like, but we suspect that their use in the capacity of consultation could be successfully extended. Philosophers have helped to frame policies in the medical, business, and legal fields, as well as with respect to scientific experimentation. Hospital ethics committees often include a professional philosopher. In addition, philosophers can frequently give useful testimony at hearings on proposed legislation or on projected public policies, and they can often advise groups of citizens who are trying to accomplish various projects through seeking grants or government funding. Such activities by philosophers are becoming more common. We believe that the record of their success to date confirms the value of philosophical skills in assessing public policy options and in guiding both the formation of large scale plans and the solution of non-academic problems. In the first half of the twentieth century, American thought was heavily influenced by two philosophers, William James and John Dewey, whose distinctive views affected not only philosophy but also psychology, education, political thought, religion, and aesthetics. James and Dewey were prototypes of the so-called public intellectual, scholars whose thought attracted an audience beyond the walls of ivy.\n\nGet an answer for 'why is the study of history important history of the world is critical for everyone to understand it affects every aspect of our lives.

Martin Heidegger\nAt its root, the act of philosophy is as simple as asking questions about our existence and trying to formulate answers: How ought I to act? What is real? What can be known? By this standard, we are all philosophers in that we must produce tentative answers to these questions in order to comprehend our own experiences. In an academic environment the study of philosophy is directed toward proactively exploring the nature of those questions and the reasoning behind their possible answers. Engaging in this philosophical process broadens our perspectives, reduces ignorance, and enriches our ability to coexist with others who are likely to perceive the world differently. The role of philosophy, since its inception and as it is incorporated into the offerings at PCC, is precisely the attempt to encourage an attitude of critical reflection that yields practical personal and social benefits. Without the ability to recognize problems, examine possible solutions, implement actions, and assess values, a person is ill-equipped to succeed in his or her current or future environment. It is for this reason that philosophy serves as a cornerstone in the educational curriculum of students and continues to provide the repertoire of skills needed to flourish in the 21st Century. Although PCC does not offer a degree in philosophy, philosophy courses are lower division collegiate courses that transfer to a four-year college or university. Philosophy courses may transfer as:\n- elective credits\n- program requirement credits\n- and\/or graduation requirements for the receiving institution\nStudents are always encouraged to check with the receiving institution, your PCC academic advisor and the University Transfer website for the most accurate and timely transfer requirement information.\n\nAsk the following questions of any evidence you encounter: Take, for example, a study showing the health benefits of a sugary cereal. That is, until you learn that a sugary cereal company funded it.You can’t automatically assume that this invalidates the study’s results, but you should certainly question them when a conflict of interests is so apparent. This was beneficial to humans when we were hunting large game and fighting off wild animals, but it can be disastrous when we’re trying to decide who to vote for. A critical thinker is aware of their cognitive biases and personal prejudices and how they influence seemingly “objective” decisions and solutions. Becoming aware of them is what makes critical thinking possible. A great way to get “unstuck” on a hard problem is to try reversing things. It may seem obvious that X causes Y, but what if Y caused X? From Newton to Einstein to Yitang Zhang, questioning assumptions is where innovation happens. All these things can be a reality if you just question your assumptions and critically evaluate your beliefs about what’s prudent, appropriate, or possible. You don’t even have to be an aspiring Einstein to benefit from questioning your assumptions. If you’re looking for some help with this process, then check out Oblique Strategies. While I venture that a lot of us did learn it, I prefer to approach learning deliberately, and so I decided to investigate critical thinking for myself. What is it, how do we do it, why is it important, and how can we get better at it? In addition to answering these questions, I’ll also offer seven ways that you can start thinking more critically today, both in and outside of class.“Critical thinking is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and\/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action.”– The Foundation for Critical Thinking The above definition from the Foundation for Critical Thinking website is pretty wordy, but critical thinking, in essence, is not that complex. If we had to think deliberately about every single action (such as breathing, for instance), we wouldn’t have any cognitive energy left for the important stuff like D&D. We can run into problems, though, when we let our automatic mental processes govern important decisions. it’s quite easy to make an ass of yourself simply by failing to question your basic assumptions. Some of the greatest innovators in human history were those who simply looked up for a moment and wondered if one of everyone’s general assumptions was wrong. That attractive person in your World Civilizations class you’ve wanted to talk to?\n\nDo you ask why? Do you want to understand what reality is, what can be known, and what makes actions right and wrong? Philosophy will appeal to your sense of curiosity about the world, as you explore topics such as justice, knowledge, reality, and truth: the ideas that have shaped our world over time. Yet the study of philosophy also prepares you for many challenges, as you analyze and evaluate the ideas of others, and clarify and defend your own ideas. You will develop problem solving abilities, communication skills, persuasive powers, and writing skills—skills needed to develop a rewarding career and a meaningful life. With its emphasis on logic, analysis, and clarity of thought, philosophy is an excellent preparation for professional fields such as artificial intelligence, business, communications, government, information sciences, law, medicine, public relations, and writing—as well as graduate study in philosophy, theology, and many other disciplines. The Philosophy Department is committed to diversity, equity, access and inclusive excellence across our curriculum. Watch as Professor Fields explains the importance of philosophy. Our faculty represent a diversity of backgrounds and areas of specialization, including ethics, logic, metaphysics, philosophy of language, philosophy of religion, and philosophy of science. Our curriculum focuses on four areas:\nFor the major, you'll complete 33 credits, consisting of five core courses and electives from the above areas for an overall total of 120 credits. When you minor in philosophy, you'll develop analytical skills and learn to cultivate clarity of thought. The philosophy minor makes an excellent addition to your academic career, because training in philosophy is highly regarded in professional fields such as law, medicine, business, and government. For the minor, you'll complete 18 credit hours.\n\n### Question: What makes philosophy valuable even though it doesn't give us definite answers?\n","passages":[{"passage":"Exposure to the diversity of outlook and opinion that one encounters in a typical college community may lead students to question whether the values they hold can be rationally defended against the charge that they are nothing more than the product of their upbringing. Philosophers have thought deeply and systematically about these fundamental questions in a way that no other discipline has. As a result, philosophers can help students grapple intellectually with the questions, not only in philosophy courses but also in various interdisciplinary programs, to be discussed a bit more fully in section (3) below. 2. Contributions to an Institution’s Core Curriculum\nMany institutions have college- or university-wide course requirements for their students, typically aimed at such goals as critical thinking or logical reasoning, sensitivity to values, and awareness of global issues. Philosophy departments are strongly positioned to contribute courses and programs that further these goals. If the aim of a particular core requirement is to develop habits of careful, critical thought in students, then philosophy is especially well-suited to the realization of this aim (see the remarks under Thinking Critically in the previous section). The study of philosophy helps students to develop both their capacity and their inclination to do critical thinking. Other disciplines also help in fulfilling this function, but philosophy contributes distinctively, intensively, and extensively to a student’s ability to think critically. Many philosophy departments regularly offer a course devoted exclusively to the topic of critical thinking. Philosophy courses can also contribute admirably to curricula that stress more formal modes of logical reasoning, emphasizing the goals of quantitative literacy and symbolic reasoning. Successful courses in the disciplines of mathematics, statistics, and computer science that aim at such a goal succeed by inculcating the skills of reasoning rigorously and logically in students. Philosophy courses in formal logic focus on those skills that are common to all these disciplines. Questions of value are among the most important and most difficult questions that students face. Philosophy courses in ethics, social and political philosophy, philosophy of law, philosophy of medicine, bioethics, environmental ethics, and aesthetics prepare students to be thoughtful, discriminating, and responsible citizens. Philosophy departments standardly offer introductory ethics courses in which students are exposed both to the dominant methods for reasoning about ethical issues and to some array of contemporary moral problems. These courses aim at giving students the conceptual tools necessary for thinking in greater depth about moral problems, an appreciation for competing moral positions, and an opportunity to develop and present their own moral views. Some of the central questions that ethics courses are likely to address are: What are the relations among morality, self-interest, religion, and law? What, if any, are the basic moral rights of persons? What, if any, moral obligations do we have to other persons, animals, the environment, and future generations? No other discipline treats these questions in the same comprehensive and systematic ways. In institutions offering academic programs in law (or pre-law), business, medicine, nursing, engineering, and other professional areas, specialized courses in applied ethics such as biomedical ethics or business ethics are important service courses that can be offered by philosophy departments. Institutions with programs in education and the fine arts, including literature, will find courses in the philosophy of education and aesthetics and the philosophy of art attractive. Philosophers have made and continue to make significant contributions to ongoing debates on a number of issues that go beyond national boundaries, such as environmental pollution, global climate change, and the status of global ecosystems; global trade and national exploitation; human rights; humanitarian intervention vs. national sovereignty; war; international law; terrorism and the status of combatants and noncombatants; foreign aid and famine relief; medical experimentation in third-world countries; and the repatriation of cultural objects. 3. Relations to Other Areas of Intellectual Inquiry\nMention of global issues at the end of the previous section suggests one way in which philosophy can collaborate fruitfully with other disciplines, such as the environmental sciences, economics, political science, and law in the examination of a family of issues. In addition to interdisciplinary collaboration, philosophy can contribute to the examination of a discipline’s foundations.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ea680cee-f35b-4066-8bde-6c41186c4d9b>"]},{"passage":"- Inductive reasoning is a method of logical thinking wherein broad generalizations and theories are derived from specific examples and observations. - Deductive reasoning, on the other hand, is opposite of inductive reasoning.

Why Do We Study Philosophy? Philosophy in life is extremely important. Why? It is because philosophy is like a way of life. It is a way of thinking, understanding, and gaining wisdom about human life, the reality, and the world. All of us are taught about philosophy at school because it is important to study about philosophy as we grow and become adults and as we fully embrace the reality of life. Here are 10 reasons why we study philosophy:\n1) To become a person of our own\nWith philosophy, we are able to think and become a person of our own. It enables us to not become just a “yes person”, who does not know how to think and decide for himself \/ herself. It gives us the ability to think critically, especially in real life situations. With this, philosophy also takes courage to be independent and decide for the self. 2) To get ready and succeed in various fields of expertise and careers\nWhen we study philosophy, we develop many essential skills such as reading, writing, speaking, reasoning, thinking, learning, adapting, communicating, and organizing. Now, these skills are very important in the real world, especially at the workplace where we need to perform and excel. Without these skills, we will be forever stuck and dependent on our families, especially our parents. 3) To realize your own understanding of what success is\nSuccess varies in different people and through philosophy, you will be able to realize and discover the meaning of success to you. Philosophy encourages you to think deeply, confront yourself, and know the answers, especially when it comes to questions about values, success, and fulfillment. 4) To be able to get great scores in standardized exams\nPhilosophy centers on critical, analytical, and logical thinking. Therefore, philosophy helps us figure out the correct answers in standardized tests like LSAT, GRE, MCAT, and GMAT. It is because these standardized exams are filled with philosophical questions and problems. 5) To grow and become a well informed citizen\nBeing an informed citizen does not only mean watching or reading the news everyday or surfing the web every hour. Being a well informed citizen means that beyond all the information overload that we are bombarded with everyday, we are able to think critically and behave according to what and why we know. 6) To have the potential to earn higher income\nPhilosophy stimulates the mind like no other field of study. This is the reason why so-called philosophers are very intelligent people full of wisdom. Now, when we study philosophy, we are able to develop our knowledge and wisdom to prepare for the real world of working and competition. We could have the potential to earn higher income through our learnings from philosophy. 7) To gain wisdom about ethical principles and their practice in real life\nThrough philosophy, we are able to learn about ethics, life, family, work, and social principles. With these ethical principles, we can be able to think and act ethically to various types of discussions, arguments, and situations. 8) To become a valuable and effective communicator\nPhilosophy teaches us the value of communication for personal and societal growth. When we study philosophy, our communication skills are also developed and enhanced. This further enables us to become excellent communicators who express our ideas, opinions, and theories effectively and intelligently. 9) To be able to determine our chosen path\nAnalytical thinking allows us to reflect on our deepest needs, desire, and passion. Philosophy helps us become analytical thinkers who are capable to know the best career path for ourselves so that we will not be wasting our time with the wrong choice or decision. 10) To get ready for a possible career in law\nSome of us want to partake in the world of law by becoming lawyers or attorneys.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:5d930711-9b1f-42e7-afd1-08291e098a07>"]},{"passage":"Philosophy starts with wonderment. Philosophers are prone to asking critical questions: about humankind, the world and society. Not satisfied with simple answers, philosophers will try to shed a light on these issues by looking at them from all the relevant angles. This wonderment results in a persistent demand for quality of argumentation. In their search for answers, philosophers delve deep for underlying motives and rational explanations. A philosopher’s search has no fixed end point: what is important, is the rational search for insights while continuously asking new questions. Over the centuries, our way of thinking has been influenced by great philosophers. The Philosophy programme gives you the opportunity to think through fundamental questions and their respective answers critically, and to make your own contribution to philosophical thought. In addition to a thorough historical study of philosophical texts, our programme also strongly focuses on critical reflection on contemporary issues: the explosion of science, ecological and bioethical issues, changes in the scientific worldview, etc… . A thorough study of important thinkers in history in combination with a focus on contemporary issues results in Philosophy students who learn to build arguments in a critical and autonomous manner, and who are able to contribute to contemporary and socially critical debates.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:fd96df31-71cf-4242-a46c-65b3bc52ee58>"]},{"passage":"Why study Philosophy? 6 reasons of weight\nAt a time when everything must be valued according to the price that can be paid for it in the market, philosophy is increasingly cornered: it is forgotten and undervalued in the political reforms of education.

If you're wondering why study philosophy , it will be very useful. 1. Offers a better scientific knowledge\nScience is a type of knowledge-gathering method that has proven to be incredibly valuable for centuries. Now, in practice, knowledge of science does not always imply interpreting the data that your research methods offer us. And is that many times we believe that scientific information is given by nature and convey an obvious meaning to anyone who knows, but this is not so. The philosophy of science it allows us to know if certain interpretations of data are adequate or not, if the research methods used allow us to draw the conclusions we want, or even if the hypotheses from which we start are defective. Thus, the training in philosophy is an excellent complement for science-based careers, on the one hand, and also allow for carving out a career as consultant science philosophers that can guide teams of researchers to review the approaches of their studies. 2.

Introduction and Aims\nIn a world of information-overload, it is paramount that we have the space to go back to basics, work out what we really think and feel, and discuss this with others in an open, accepting and questioning environment. Philosophical enquiries are already the perfect space for the rigorous, critical thinking we desperately need more of. By integrating arts activities into them, I hope to develop philosophical enquiries into spaces that also provide the perfect environment for people to express themselves, explore issues that matter, and learn creatively. I understand there to be five reasons for interleaving the arts with philosophical enquiry:\nTo encourage deep thinking about issues that matter to individuals and society;\nTo encourage emotional and embodied engagement with topics, so participants use their own sense of the world as a starting point for dialogue;\nTo help participants articulate and reflect on what they have learned through artistic practices, helping to improve their skills in these practices;\nTo provide enquiries that are more dynamic and interactive, through participants co-creating the stimuli for enquiries;\nTo allow a diversity of activities so: 1.

What is Philosophical Enquiry? Philosophical enquiries involve participants grappling with ideas on their own terms. This helps them to become better at reasoning, reflecting, and developing their own views on topics. My sessions include games, activities, and small and large group discussions. The role of the facilitator is to structure sessions to include these elements in a way that is fun and allows in-depth exploration of a particular topic. Facilitators also traditionally provide a stimulus which acts as a starting point for dialogue. For example, the facilitator may tell a story, which leads to a particular question from the facilitator, or which is used to provoke questions from participants. From this initial discussion, facilitators also identify ‘emergent questions’, or encourage participants to identify emergent questions - which are questions that emerge from the participants discussion. A philosophical discussions can be about almost any subject. Traditional questions concern, for example, who we are and whether we are the same person through time, how to lead a good life, and what it means for objects to exist. However, we can approach other questions philosophically, for example, what is our place in nature? how should we treat our environment? and, how should we understand social justice issues such as race and gender? Facilitators encourage participants to think about their views, why they hold them, and whether they should hold them. This helps participants to improve their critical thinking skills, encouraging participants to think independently and develop their views. Facilitators also encourage participants to understand what others believe and why, and to respond respectfully and with an open-mind. This allows participants to develop their social skills, becoming more able to understand and engage with other people’s perspective. 3. Philosophy and the Arts - A Rationale\nPhilosophical enquiry traditionally favours verbal dialogue over other methods of meaning-making. While this is a reasonable limitation in many contexts, as a facilitator I am interested in collaborating with artists to find ways of using the body and the senses to help participants explore multiple ways of understanding themselves and the world. Philosophical thinking is often thought of as the pinnacle of abstraction, but engaging exclusively in verbal exchange can lead to philosophy that gets lost in logical puzzles, combative arguments, and an over-emphasis on issues that are irrelevant to our daily lives and the world we live in. Creative practices that engage us emotionally could work together with philosophical discussions to help people express their deepest sense of the world, and help participants to develop their views and learn about how others approach the world. I understand this interaction to work two-ways - that creative practice is important for philosophical exploration and understanding and that philosophical exploration is important for making sense of creative practice, potentially improving it, and helping us integrate creative activities into our wider experience and understanding. Philosophical enquiries traditionally involve a facilitator presenting a stimulus, to which participants respond. A collaboration between philosophy and the arts provides a way to expand pedagogical technique, and include participants in the creation of the stimulus. This immersive environment both allows participants more agency over their learning, and provides further creative space. 4.

In exploring concepts and methods of inquiry used by other disciplines, in taking up questions that disciplines generate about their own subject matter, and in examining the questions that are fundamental to any area of inquiry concerned with producing knowledge about the world and making value claims about that knowledge, philosophy fulfills a unique and important role as a meta-discipline. It provides a kind of understanding of the other disciplines, particularly of their presuppositions, standards of evidence, and modes of explanation, that other fields of study neither attempt nor are able to provide. The potential value of a strong philosophy department for other disciplines must not be taken, however, to suggest that philosophy programs can be appropriately absorbed into others, whether they be humanities departments or broad divisions such as those comprising the social sciences. Philosophy is methodologically distinct, and it pursues a distinct set of questions. An autonomous philosophy program is vital both for these reasons and in order to maximize the contribution that philosophers, unencumbered by the constraints, special standards, or narrower subject matter of other disciplines, can make to their colleagues and students. 4. Contributions beyond the Curriculum\nIn such areas as public service, continuing education, alumni relations, consultation, and public visibility, philosophers can excel in representing and furthering the interests of their institutions. Colleges and universities quite properly feel obligations to the communities in which they exist and the populations from which they draw their students. Philosophers can contribute greatly to fulfilling these obligations. In most communities there is much concern with a variety of public policy issues, for instance crime and punishment, welfare, medical care, environmental stewardship, and nuclear plants. Philosophers are generally competent to speak informatively on certain important aspects of these issues, particularly the normative aspects, which are often the most important. Under various different sorts of auspices many philosophers have addressed public audiences on such issues. The results have often enhanced public understanding both of the issues under discussion and of the relevance of philosophical reflection to questions of public policy. Continuing Education and Alumni Relations\nHeightened demand for classes has resulted in a new emphasis on \"continuing education” courses. These courses are designed mainly for adults over the typical college age who want enrichment or wish an extension of their post-secondary education. Often, such people want to reflect on normative issues, to discover or return to some of the perennial questions, or simply to try something new. Philosophy has much to offer them. This fact needs wider recognition by administrators, academic advisors, and philosophers themselves. In many cases, a school’s alumni would be interested in programs or short courses in philosophy. Philosophy departments can contribute significantly to satisfying the needs of alumni and many others above the usual college age, whether they seek mainly the intellectual enrichment of philosophy or some of the conceptual and other general skills that the study of philosophy can help to develop. Many philosophers have been consultants to institutions, agencies, businesses, and the like, but we suspect that their use in the capacity of consultation could be successfully extended. Philosophers have helped to frame policies in the medical, business, and legal fields, as well as with respect to scientific experimentation. Hospital ethics committees often include a professional philosopher. In addition, philosophers can frequently give useful testimony at hearings on proposed legislation or on projected public policies, and they can often advise groups of citizens who are trying to accomplish various projects through seeking grants or government funding. Such activities by philosophers are becoming more common. We believe that the record of their success to date confirms the value of philosophical skills in assessing public policy options and in guiding both the formation of large scale plans and the solution of non-academic problems. In the first half of the twentieth century, American thought was heavily influenced by two philosophers, William James and John Dewey, whose distinctive views affected not only philosophy but also psychology, education, political thought, religion, and aesthetics. James and Dewey were prototypes of the so-called public intellectual, scholars whose thought attracted an audience beyond the walls of ivy.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ea680cee-f35b-4066-8bde-6c41186c4d9b>"]},{"passage":"Get an answer for 'why is the study of history important history of the world is critical for everyone to understand it affects every aspect of our lives.

Martin Heidegger\nAt its root, the act of philosophy is as simple as asking questions about our existence and trying to formulate answers: How ought I to act? What is real? What can be known? By this standard, we are all philosophers in that we must produce tentative answers to these questions in order to comprehend our own experiences. In an academic environment the study of philosophy is directed toward proactively exploring the nature of those questions and the reasoning behind their possible answers. Engaging in this philosophical process broadens our perspectives, reduces ignorance, and enriches our ability to coexist with others who are likely to perceive the world differently. The role of philosophy, since its inception and as it is incorporated into the offerings at PCC, is precisely the attempt to encourage an attitude of critical reflection that yields practical personal and social benefits. Without the ability to recognize problems, examine possible solutions, implement actions, and assess values, a person is ill-equipped to succeed in his or her current or future environment. It is for this reason that philosophy serves as a cornerstone in the educational curriculum of students and continues to provide the repertoire of skills needed to flourish in the 21st Century. Although PCC does not offer a degree in philosophy, philosophy courses are lower division collegiate courses that transfer to a four-year college or university. Philosophy courses may transfer as:\n- elective credits\n- program requirement credits\n- and\/or graduation requirements for the receiving institution\nStudents are always encouraged to check with the receiving institution, your PCC academic advisor and the University Transfer website for the most accurate and timely transfer requirement information.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:bd648eda-6693-44c4-ac91-44996d861953>"]},{"passage":"Ask the following questions of any evidence you encounter: Take, for example, a study showing the health benefits of a sugary cereal. That is, until you learn that a sugary cereal company funded it.You can’t automatically assume that this invalidates the study’s results, but you should certainly question them when a conflict of interests is so apparent. This was beneficial to humans when we were hunting large game and fighting off wild animals, but it can be disastrous when we’re trying to decide who to vote for. A critical thinker is aware of their cognitive biases and personal prejudices and how they influence seemingly “objective” decisions and solutions. Becoming aware of them is what makes critical thinking possible. A great way to get “unstuck” on a hard problem is to try reversing things. It may seem obvious that X causes Y, but what if Y caused X? From Newton to Einstein to Yitang Zhang, questioning assumptions is where innovation happens. All these things can be a reality if you just question your assumptions and critically evaluate your beliefs about what’s prudent, appropriate, or possible. You don’t even have to be an aspiring Einstein to benefit from questioning your assumptions. If you’re looking for some help with this process, then check out Oblique Strategies. While I venture that a lot of us did learn it, I prefer to approach learning deliberately, and so I decided to investigate critical thinking for myself. What is it, how do we do it, why is it important, and how can we get better at it? In addition to answering these questions, I’ll also offer seven ways that you can start thinking more critically today, both in and outside of class.“Critical thinking is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and\/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action.”– The Foundation for Critical Thinking The above definition from the Foundation for Critical Thinking website is pretty wordy, but critical thinking, in essence, is not that complex. If we had to think deliberately about every single action (such as breathing, for instance), we wouldn’t have any cognitive energy left for the important stuff like D&D. We can run into problems, though, when we let our automatic mental processes govern important decisions. it’s quite easy to make an ass of yourself simply by failing to question your basic assumptions.

Different rules and laws apply to the road so being aware of these before you drive on them is a good idea. Each state has a different set of road rules\nThe US is a big place and is home to a whopping 50 states. Each state has its own set of driving rules and laws and knowing how these differ from state to state is highly important. Many of the rules remain the same, but some of them do vary a bit so you should check when you pick up your RV rental for these variations. The maximum highway speed in most states is 65 miles per hour, unless otherwise indicated. These speed limits are strictly enforced by radar in most states. As a general rule, the minimum age for driving in most states is 16, yet some states restrict driving until drivers are 18 years of age. Some campervan rental companies charge additional fees for drivers under the age of 25. Nearly every state in America has laws that make it illegal to drive without a seat belt on. Seat belts must be worn by the driver and all passengers, and some states even require special child restraint seats for all young children. In USA each State has its own laws with regards to child restraints. For the safety of your children we recommend that any child under the age of 8 must wear an approved, properly fastened and adjusted child restraint. For all of those out there who have radar detectors built into their GPS units, be careful in which states you use this function. While some states allow you to use them, others do not and you may be fined if you are using one illegally. In some areas, the police are more particular on enforcing the law, especially in school areas, in which is the speed limit is 15 miles per hour, and also around school buses, especially when their lights are flashing. Police will also come down heavy on your for drink driving, which is strictly prohibited in all states. US Highway System\nThe highways in the US are often referred to as \"interstate highways\" or state maintained roads. While some of them do have tolls, most are free, allowing for smooth sailing all the way along them. Major interstate highways running from north to south are ordered from I-5 to I-95, and east to west interstates are order from I-8 to I-10.

Such programs\/consortiums will usually provide all necessary materials and help to ensure compliance. |Table 3.1: REQUIRED TESTS FOR DRUGS & ALCOHOL|\n|Drug Tests||Pre-Employment, Post-Accident, Random, Reasonable Suspicion, Return-to-Duty, and Follow-Up.|\n|Alcohol Tests||Post-Accident, Random, Reasonable Suspicion, Return-to-Duty, and Follow-Up.|\n\nThe Commercial Driver Act (S.1672), introduced last month by Sen. Deb Fischer (R-NE) would let truck drivers under the age of 21 operate commercial motor vehicles across state lines. Now, 18- to 20-year old drivers are only allowed to drive intrastate. Participating states would have to enter the agreement and standardize the licensingrequirement for drivers who will travel between states. The American Trucking Association supports the legislation. “Right now, an 18-year-old can drive a truck within the borders of his state, but not to deliver goods across state lines—this means a young adult could drive a truck from El Paso, Texas to Dallas—a distance of more than 600 miles—but couldn’t cross the street to deliver that same load from Texarkana, Texas to Texarkana, Ark.,” said ATA President and CEO Bill Graves. According to the ATA, a main benefit of the Commercial Driver Act is that states would be able to impose safeguards to ensure young, inexperienced drivers learn safe trucking practice for the road. The ATA believes the change will draw younger people to trucking jobs; the legislation creates jobs for high school graduates who suffer from high unemployment rates. And, the US trucking industry is experiencing a driver shortage that is estimated to be short about 50,000 drivers, and will increase to 240,000 drivers by 2023. The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association has claimed that effective driver training is essential before any CDL rule changes are made. On the other hand, Sen. Deb Fisher’s legislation meets strong opposition by the Truck Safety Coalition (TSC). The TSC opposes Fischer’s language, mentioning an increase in truck-related crashes and injuries since 2009. According to the TSC, drivers under 21 lack experience and have a higher crash risk. The American Transportation Research Institute may have an idea to resolve the issue: it will work on a “younger driver assessment tool” that identifies experienced drivers’ behavior features and finds ways to teach young drivers such behaviors. The legislation is supported among professionals in the trucking industry; it proposes changes that could engage more young people to drive and will help relieve the driver shortage. Alternatively, there are safety concerns when it comes to young, inexperienced drivers who will operate long hours. The disputes will continue, while the highway bill is set for debate in the Senate.\n\nUtah Drivers' License Test 2019 - FREE Practice!

The checklist provides an opportunity to review concepts and provide feedback on the driving lesson. Using this tool provides structure to each lesson, which facilitates learning for the teen and helps the parent feel more comfortable about the process of teaching the teen to drive. The parent should complete one copy of the checklist during each lesson. Before the parents share it with the teen at the end of the lesson, the teen can complete a second copy of the evaluation. This self-evaluation helps teens learn to assess the driving behavior of themselves and other drivers, a critical concept once they are out on the road on their own. After the teen finishes the self-assessment, the two checklists should be compared and discussed in detail. Parents should be sure to acknowledge areas of improvement as well as make a note of skills that need further discussion and practice. If the driving lesson was particularly difficult, parents can wait a few hours to have the discussion, but it should take place prior to the next driving lesson so the teen won’t continue to practice bad habits. Since the checklist includes basic, intermediate, and advanced skills, parents can easily tailor each driving lesson to a specific set of skills. Avoid packing too much into one driving lesson, which could overwhelm the teen driver. It is better to hold a few extra lessons than to take a chance on skimping on a teen driver’s knowledge of critical driving skills. Graduated Driver Licensing Laws: A Comparison\nApril 8, 2009\nA national model for Graduated Driver Licensing Programs has existed since the mid 1990s. The model provides guidelines for states to create their own GDL programs. Currently, no state follows all the guidelines, and GDL programs vary widely from state to state. The recommended guidelines are:\nStage 1: Learner’s Permit\n- State sets minimum age for a learner’s permit at no younger than age 16;\n- Pass vision and knowledge tests, including rules of the road, signs, and signals;\n- Completion of basic driver training;\n- Licensed adult (who is at least 21 years old) required in the vehicle at all times;\n- All occupants must wear seat belts;\n- Teenage-passenger restrictions;\n- Zero alcohol while driving;\n- Permit is visually distinctive from other driver licenses;\n- Must remain crash and conviction free for at least six months to advance to next level;\n- Parental certification of 30 to 50 practice hours; and\n- No use of portable electronic communication and entertainment devices. Stage 2: Intermediate (Provisional) License\n- Completion of Stage 1;\n- State sets minimum age of 16.5;\n- Pass a behind the wheel road test;\n- Completion of advanced driver education training (safe driving decision-making, risk education, etc. )-All occupants must wear seat belts;\n- Licensed adult required in the vehicle from 10 p.m. until 5 a.m. (e.g., nighttime driving restriction);\n- Zero alcohol while driving;\n- Driver improvement actions are initiated at lower point level than for regular drivers;\n- Provisional license is visually distinctive from a regular license;\n- Teenage-passenger restrictions: not more than one teenage passenger for the first 12 months of intermediate license. Afterward, limit the number of teenage passengers to two until age 18;\n- Must remain crash and conviction free for at least 12 consecutive months to advance to the next stage;\n- Supervised practice; and\n- No use of portable electronic communication and entertainment devices. Stage 3: Full Licensure\n- Completion of Stage 2;\n- State sets minimum age of 18 for lifting passenger and nighttime restrictions; and\n- Zero alcohol while driving. Source: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\nTo understand the range of differences among states, let’s examine the GDL laws of four states: California, Florida, Mississippi, and North Dakota. The NHTSA recommends that the state sets the minimum age for a learner’s permit at no younger than age 16. In California, the minimum age for a learner’s permit is 15 years, six months; in Florida and Mississippi, the minimum age is 15. The minimum age in North Dakota is 14. Before getting a license or restricted license in Florida, new drivers must have a mandatory holding period of the learner’s license of twelve months; the other three states require six months. In Mississippi, license applicants age 17 and older are exempt from the holding period. The NHTSA recommends an intermediate (provisional) stage with a minimum age of 16.5.\n\nAge: You must be at least 18 years old to obtain a Class A CDL, but you cannot engage in interstate commerce until you are at least 21 years old. 2. Driver's License: You must have a valid driver's license and a good driving record. 3. Medical Certification: You must provide a valid medical certificate that meets the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) medical standards. 4. Knowledge Tests: You must pass the general knowledge test and any applicable endorsement tests, such as air brakes and combination vehicles. 5. Commercial Learner's Permit (CLP): You must obtain a Commercial Learner's Permit (CLP) by passing the knowledge tests. 6. Training: You must complete behind-the-wheel training with a qualified instructor or employer, and practice driving with your CLP under the supervision of a licensed CDL holder. 7. Skills Test: You must pass a three-part skills test that includes pre-trip inspection, basic control skills, and an on-road driving test. 8. Fees: You must pay the required fees to obtain your Class A CDL license. It is important to note that additional requirements may apply depending on the type of commercial vehicle you plan to operate, such as endorsements for hazardous materials or passenger transport. It is important to note that some employers may have additional age requirements for their drivers, so it is important to check with potential employers to determine their specific hiring criteria. In Oregon, the following endorsements are available for Class A CDL holders:\n1. T - Double\/Triple Trailers: To pull double or triple trailers. 2. P - Passenger: To transport passengers in a commercial vehicle. 3. N - Tank Vehicle: To transport liquids or gases in bulk containers. 4. H - Hazardous Materials: To transport hazardous materials as defined by federal regulations. 5. X - Combination of Tank Vehicle and Hazardous Materials: To transport both hazardous materials and liquids or gases in bulk containers. If you plan to operate a commercial vehicle that requires any of these endorsements, you will need to pass additional knowledge tests and meet other requirements, such as background checks and fingerprinting. 1. Pre-Trip Vehicle Inspection: You will be asked to perform a thorough inspection of your vehicle to ensure that it is safe to operate. This includes checking the brakes, steering, lights, tires, and other components. 2. Basic Vehicle Control: You will be asked to demonstrate your ability to control your vehicle in a variety of situations, such as backing up, turning, and maneuvering through a course. 3. On-Road Driving: You will be asked to drive your vehicle on public roads while demonstrating your ability to follow traffic laws, merge safely onto highways, change lanes, and make turns. Each part of the test is designed to evaluate your knowledge and skills related to operating a commercial vehicle safely and effectively. It is important to practice and prepare for the test by studying the Oregon Commercial Driver Manual and getting hands-on experience with a qualified instructor or mentor. 1. Air Brake Restriction: If you have not passed the air brake knowledge test and skills test, you will have an \"L\" restriction on your license, which means you are not authorized to drive a commercial vehicle with air brakes. 2. Intrastate Only Restriction: If you do not meet the federal medical requirements or do not self-certify to operate in interstate commerce, you will have an \"O\" restriction on your license, which means you are only authorized to operate commercial vehicles within Oregon. 3. Automatic Transmission Restriction: If you take your skills test in a vehicle with an automatic transmission, you will have an \"E\" restriction on your license, which means you are not authorized to drive a commercial vehicle with a manual transmission. 4. Other restrictions: Depending on your driving history or other factors, you may have additional restrictions on your license, such as a restriction that limits you to driving during daylight hours or prohibits you from driving certain types of vehicles. It is important to understand and comply with any restrictions or limitations on your CDL license to avoid penalties or other consequences. However, it's important to note that the skills test and the pre-trip inspection test must be taken in English. This is because the CDL skills test requires clear communication between the examiner and the driver, and the pre-trip inspection test involves identifying and describing various components of a commercial vehicle using standard English terminology.\n\nThe same proportion of 30 to year-olds are licence holders — and are expected to drive retewting at leastit adds.

In Honduras, many people attest they didn’t have to take a written or driving test. Why is the driving age so low in America? The reasons are complex, but as with every other significant social shift, economic factors play a dominant role. The most recent Federal Highway Administration data shows that just over a quarter (25.6 percent) of 16-year-olds became licensed drivers in 2018, and only 61 percent of teens had their licenses by age 18. Why should 14 year olds drive? A 14 yr old is certainly physically capable of driving a car. The problems with allowing someone so young to legally drive is that they are not mature enough to make the right decisions when there is any type of emergency situation. Why raising the driving age is bad? When we read that motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for teens, that 16-year-olds have higher crash rates than drivers of any other age and that they are also three times more likely to die in a motor vehicle crash than the average of all drivers, we take note. Why they shouldn’t raise the driving age? The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety probably is right in saying the roads would be safer if the age for getting a driver’s license were raised to 17 or 18. The institute reasons that holding off a year or two in allowing teens to drive would significantly reduce car crashes. …\nWhat is the best age to learn driving? That strong family support and foundation of good skills and responsible behaviors is important. That’s why 16 is really the best age for teens to learn to drive. Why Driving at 16 is a good thing? Developmentally, teens at the age 16 are ready to start driving, Teens starting to drive at 16 bring less stress to families because the teens are able to drive themselves, and Starting driving at the age 16 helps maturity level grow and build responsibility. Therefore, the driver’s age should not be raised to 18. What’s the youngest age to drive? What state has the oldest driving age?\n\nEach U.S. state establishes its own driving laws. These include speed limits, cell phone use, and seat belt laws. Despite these laws to promote road safety, some states still have the worst drivers. States have adopted graduated license programs to help teens learn and adapt to safe driving. Each state establishes its own driving laws, and ages can vary greatly. Driver’s licenses are issued by each state, including the District of Columbia, rather than by the federal government. Drivers are required to obtain a license in their state of residence, but all states recognize each other’s licenses as valid forms of identification for non-resident age requirements. States have specific ages for learner’s permits, restricted licenses, full licenses, and rental cars. Graduated license programs have been so effective that states are considering adopting similar programs for older teens (18 to 20-year-olds) who are becoming first-time drivers. Once a teen is of age to get his\/her learner’s permit, a set number of hours of professional instruction are typically required to receive the permit. Some states require every driver to attend some type of driver’s education before obtaining a learner’s permit. Restricted licenses have regulations on drivers for a period of time after receiving their license, typically anywhere between the first six months to the first year and a half. Restricted licenses typically prohibit the driver from driving at night past a specific hour or having more than one passenger under a specific age in the car. Once drivers reach the full license age, they are eligible for a full, unrestricted license. Some states require that the driver must not have been convicted of violating a traffic law with their restricted license to receive their full license. In some states, such as Oklahoma, the law requires drivers to have their restricted license for at least six months and then allows drivers to be eligible for a full license. Drivers must go to their state’s DMV to obtain a new license. The youngest age in any state that a driver can obtain a learner’s permit is 14 years old, and the highest age is 16 years old. Restricted licenses can be obtained anywhere from 14.5 years to 17 years old, and full licenses are granted between 16 to 18 years old.\n\n### Question: What are the specific age requirements for interstate versus intrastate commercial driving operations?","passages":[{"passage":"CDL License Requirements and General Qualifications\nCDL License Requirements will vary by state.

Different rules and laws apply to the road so being aware of these before you drive on them is a good idea. Each state has a different set of road rules\nThe US is a big place and is home to a whopping 50 states. Each state has its own set of driving rules and laws and knowing how these differ from state to state is highly important. Many of the rules remain the same, but some of them do vary a bit so you should check when you pick up your RV rental for these variations. The maximum highway speed in most states is 65 miles per hour, unless otherwise indicated. These speed limits are strictly enforced by radar in most states. As a general rule, the minimum age for driving in most states is 16, yet some states restrict driving until drivers are 18 years of age. Some campervan rental companies charge additional fees for drivers under the age of 25. Nearly every state in America has laws that make it illegal to drive without a seat belt on. Seat belts must be worn by the driver and all passengers, and some states even require special child restraint seats for all young children. In USA each State has its own laws with regards to child restraints. For the safety of your children we recommend that any child under the age of 8 must wear an approved, properly fastened and adjusted child restraint. For all of those out there who have radar detectors built into their GPS units, be careful in which states you use this function. While some states allow you to use them, others do not and you may be fined if you are using one illegally. In some areas, the police are more particular on enforcing the law, especially in school areas, in which is the speed limit is 15 miles per hour, and also around school buses, especially when their lights are flashing. Police will also come down heavy on your for drink driving, which is strictly prohibited in all states.

While some of them do have tolls, most are free, allowing for smooth sailing all the way along them.

Deb Fischer (R-NE) would let truck drivers under the age of 21 operate commercial motor vehicles across state lines. Now, 18- to 20-year old drivers are only allowed to drive intrastate. Participating states would have to enter the agreement and standardize the licensingrequirement for drivers who will travel between states. The American Trucking Association supports the legislation. “Right now, an 18-year-old can drive a truck within the borders of his state, but not to deliver goods across state lines—this means a young adult could drive a truck from El Paso, Texas to Dallas—a distance of more than 600 miles—but couldn’t cross the street to deliver that same load from Texarkana, Texas to Texarkana, Ark.,” said ATA President and CEO Bill Graves. According to the ATA, a main benefit of the Commercial Driver Act is that states would be able to impose safeguards to ensure young, inexperienced drivers learn safe trucking practice for the road. The ATA believes the change will draw younger people to trucking jobs; the legislation creates jobs for high school graduates who suffer from high unemployment rates. And, the US trucking industry is experiencing a driver shortage that is estimated to be short about 50,000 drivers, and will increase to 240,000 drivers by 2023. The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association has claimed that effective driver training is essential before any CDL rule changes are made. On the other hand, Sen. Deb Fisher’s legislation meets strong opposition by the Truck Safety Coalition (TSC). The TSC opposes Fischer’s language, mentioning an increase in truck-related crashes and injuries since 2009. According to the TSC, drivers under 21 lack experience and have a higher crash risk. The American Transportation Research Institute may have an idea to resolve the issue: it will work on a “younger driver assessment tool” that identifies experienced drivers’ behavior features and finds ways to teach young drivers such behaviors. The legislation is supported among professionals in the trucking industry; it proposes changes that could engage more young people to drive and will help relieve the driver shortage. Alternatively, there are safety concerns when it comes to young, inexperienced drivers who will operate long hours.

The model provides guidelines for states to create their own GDL programs. Currently, no state follows all the guidelines, and GDL programs vary widely from state to state. The recommended guidelines are:\nStage 1: Learner’s Permit\n- State sets minimum age for a learner’s permit at no younger than age 16;\n- Pass vision and knowledge tests, including rules of the road, signs, and signals;\n- Completion of basic driver training;\n- Licensed adult (who is at least 21 years old) required in the vehicle at all times;\n- All occupants must wear seat belts;\n- Teenage-passenger restrictions;\n- Zero alcohol while driving;\n- Permit is visually distinctive from other driver licenses;\n- Must remain crash and conviction free for at least six months to advance to next level;\n- Parental certification of 30 to 50 practice hours; and\n- No use of portable electronic communication and entertainment devices. Stage 2: Intermediate (Provisional) License\n- Completion of Stage 1;\n- State sets minimum age of 16.5;\n- Pass a behind the wheel road test;\n- Completion of advanced driver education training (safe driving decision-making, risk education, etc. )-All occupants must wear seat belts;\n- Licensed adult required in the vehicle from 10 p.m. until 5 a.m. (e.g., nighttime driving restriction);\n- Zero alcohol while driving;\n- Driver improvement actions are initiated at lower point level than for regular drivers;\n- Provisional license is visually distinctive from a regular license;\n- Teenage-passenger restrictions: not more than one teenage passenger for the first 12 months of intermediate license. Afterward, limit the number of teenage passengers to two until age 18;\n- Must remain crash and conviction free for at least 12 consecutive months to advance to the next stage;\n- Supervised practice; and\n- No use of portable electronic communication and entertainment devices. Stage 3: Full Licensure\n- Completion of Stage 2;\n- State sets minimum age of 18 for lifting passenger and nighttime restrictions; and\n- Zero alcohol while driving. Source: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\nTo understand the range of differences among states, let’s examine the GDL laws of four states: California, Florida, Mississippi, and North Dakota. The NHTSA recommends that the state sets the minimum age for a learner’s permit at no younger than age 16. In California, the minimum age for a learner’s permit is 15 years, six months; in Florida and Mississippi, the minimum age is 15. The minimum age in North Dakota is 14. Before getting a license or restricted license in Florida, new drivers must have a mandatory holding period of the learner’s license of twelve months; the other three states require six months. In Mississippi, license applicants age 17 and older are exempt from the holding period. The NHTSA recommends an intermediate (provisional) stage with a minimum age of 16.5.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:389ddb2f-bb54-4e5e-8b28-899dfaf33f29>"]},{"passage":"Age: You must be at least 18 years old to obtain a Class A CDL, but you cannot engage in interstate commerce until you are at least 21 years old. 2.

Skills Test: You must pass a three-part skills test that includes pre-trip inspection, basic control skills, and an on-road driving test. 8. Fees: You must pay the required fees to obtain your Class A CDL license. It is important to note that additional requirements may apply depending on the type of commercial vehicle you plan to operate, such as endorsements for hazardous materials or passenger transport. It is important to note that some employers may have additional age requirements for their drivers, so it is important to check with potential employers to determine their specific hiring criteria. In Oregon, the following endorsements are available for Class A CDL holders:\n1. T - Double\/Triple Trailers: To pull double or triple trailers. 2. P - Passenger: To transport passengers in a commercial vehicle. 3. N - Tank Vehicle: To transport liquids or gases in bulk containers. 4. H - Hazardous Materials: To transport hazardous materials as defined by federal regulations. 5. X - Combination of Tank Vehicle and Hazardous Materials: To transport both hazardous materials and liquids or gases in bulk containers. If you plan to operate a commercial vehicle that requires any of these endorsements, you will need to pass additional knowledge tests and meet other requirements, such as background checks and fingerprinting. 1. Pre-Trip Vehicle Inspection: You will be asked to perform a thorough inspection of your vehicle to ensure that it is safe to operate. This includes checking the brakes, steering, lights, tires, and other components. 2. Basic Vehicle Control: You will be asked to demonstrate your ability to control your vehicle in a variety of situations, such as backing up, turning, and maneuvering through a course. 3. On-Road Driving: You will be asked to drive your vehicle on public roads while demonstrating your ability to follow traffic laws, merge safely onto highways, change lanes, and make turns. Each part of the test is designed to evaluate your knowledge and skills related to operating a commercial vehicle safely and effectively. It is important to practice and prepare for the test by studying the Oregon Commercial Driver Manual and getting hands-on experience with a qualified instructor or mentor. 1. Air Brake Restriction: If you have not passed the air brake knowledge test and skills test, you will have an \"L\" restriction on your license, which means you are not authorized to drive a commercial vehicle with air brakes. 2. Intrastate Only Restriction: If you do not meet the federal medical requirements or do not self-certify to operate in interstate commerce, you will have an \"O\" restriction on your license, which means you are only authorized to operate commercial vehicles within Oregon. 3. Automatic Transmission Restriction: If you take your skills test in a vehicle with an automatic transmission, you will have an \"E\" restriction on your license, which means you are not authorized to drive a commercial vehicle with a manual transmission. 4. Other restrictions: Depending on your driving history or other factors, you may have additional restrictions on your license, such as a restriction that limits you to driving during daylight hours or prohibits you from driving certain types of vehicles. It is important to understand and comply with any restrictions or limitations on your CDL license to avoid penalties or other consequences. However, it's important to note that the skills test and the pre-trip inspection test must be taken in English. This is because the CDL skills test requires clear communication between the examiner and the driver, and the pre-trip inspection test involves identifying and describing various components of a commercial vehicle using standard English terminology.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:717ef48f-dfee-437e-b1fd-53ac481e4736>"]},{"passage":"The same proportion of 30 to year-olds are licence holders — and are expected to drive retewting at leastit adds.

These include speed limits, cell phone use, and seat belt laws. Despite these laws to promote road safety, some states still have the worst drivers. States have adopted graduated license programs to help teens learn and adapt to safe driving. Each state establishes its own driving laws, and ages can vary greatly. Driver’s licenses are issued by each state, including the District of Columbia, rather than by the federal government. Drivers are required to obtain a license in their state of residence, but all states recognize each other’s licenses as valid forms of identification for non-resident age requirements. States have specific ages for learner’s permits, restricted licenses, full licenses, and rental cars. Graduated license programs have been so effective that states are considering adopting similar programs for older teens (18 to 20-year-olds) who are becoming first-time drivers. Once a teen is of age to get his\/her learner’s permit, a set number of hours of professional instruction are typically required to receive the permit. Some states require every driver to attend some type of driver’s education before obtaining a learner’s permit. Restricted licenses have regulations on drivers for a period of time after receiving their license, typically anywhere between the first six months to the first year and a half. Restricted licenses typically prohibit the driver from driving at night past a specific hour or having more than one passenger under a specific age in the car. Once drivers reach the full license age, they are eligible for a full, unrestricted license. Some states require that the driver must not have been convicted of violating a traffic law with their restricted license to receive their full license. In some states, such as Oklahoma, the law requires drivers to have their restricted license for at least six months and then allows drivers to be eligible for a full license. Drivers must go to their state’s DMV to obtain a new license. The youngest age in any state that a driver can obtain a learner’s permit is 14 years old, and the highest age is 16 years old.

Duh. Explain the origins of the game. Show us details about concepts and ideas that formed the game. Explain how the game plays. It's genre, style, etecetra. Write the story of the game out here. If it has no story just skip this section. What characters are involved\/playable in the game\n\nBecause I was so intrigued by this title I wanted to know a bit more about the game so I also asked a couple of other questions regarding gameplay and the overall look of the game. Q: Can you describe a bit about how the game will play? With so many references to other game titles, it leaves me wondering what the gameplay style will be like. A: The game will be divided in two parts: the action sequences, and the question sequences. In the action sequences, you control Jeanne like in a regular platformer. You can climb ladders and walls, look at some elements in the background, talk with NPC and so on. There is no inventory, only a stamina\/life gauge that you’ll have to look for. The more you run, climb and fall from high heights, the more Jeanne will be exhausted, which can be annoying if you’re chased by an enemy. Those action sequences will also probably include some infiltration mechanics. The question sequences will pop up (kind of) randomly during the game. A question will be asked to Jeanne and depending on the player’s answer (among 2 choices), the game and scenario will take some new orientations. The thing is, we don’t talk about 10 or 20 questions in the whole game, but around 300. Theses questions will act like a psychological test on the game and will also be a way for me to tell the story. After answering a question, the player will be sent to another action sequence and so on. Q: The screens that you included in your press kit are all very intriguing! It looks as if the game will take place across many different areas. Would you like to go into any detail about the various areas available to players? A: To be perfectly true, I’m still searching what “kind” of horror I will push, and I really don’t know yet if all the visuals I sent you will be in the final game. I’m still searching, now I’m just throwing out ideas, and I’ll see which ones I’ll keep on the way. The things I can say for sure are:\n– The action will take place in a “kind of” European city (mostly inspired by Paris and Italian cities like Milan or Rome). – There won’t be any zombies in it or Silent Hill-esque monsters. I’d prefer to look more in esoteric themes. – Jeanne is an actress, so yeah, some sequences will take place in theaters or on movie sets. – The pyramid on the moon will be one of the key places of the story. There is no denying that the gameplay mechanics sound interesting. I’m digging the bits about her becoming exhausted even if that could happen at inopportune moments. We will definitely keep up with Jeanne as the game is being developed and see what sort of look the game will ultimately take on, and the various locations that will be available to players.

Introduction to Hogwarts Legacy\nA brand-new role-playing game based on the Harry Potter wizarding universe is called Hogwarts Legacy. Avalanche Software created it, and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment distributed it. Players get the opportunity to tour the expansive Hogwarts campus, take lessons, practice spells, and feel the enchantment of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in this game. Before the events of the Harry Potter books, in the 19th century, the game takes place. Players may delve into the expansive and stunning world of Hogwarts and beyond since it is set in a time of magic and mystery. Players get the option to immerse themselves in the enchantment of Hogwarts and the Harry Potter wizarding world through the game. Key Features of the Game\nSome of the key features of Hogwarts Legacy include:\n- Immersive environment and characters\n- Spellcasting mechanics\n- Character customization and progression\n- Exploration and quests\n- Multiplayer mode with co-op play and PvP options\n- Community features and future updates\nHogwarts Legacy Gameplay\nStoryline and Gameplay of Hogwarts Legacy\nSummary of the Story\nAs a recently enrolled student to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the player is the focus of the game’s narrative. The player discovers a sinister and evil plan that threatens the wizarding realm as they advance through the game. To save the wizarding community and learn the truth about the scheme, the player must use their abilities and magic. Developing and modifying characters\nIn addition to choosing their house and enrolling in classes to master spells and talents, players can build and personalize their characters. New spells, skills, and abilities will become available as the player’s character evolves and grows through time. Combat and Spellcasting Mechanics\nA unique spellcasting mechanism in the game enables players to cast spells in a variety of methods, such as through hand motions or incantations. Players can engage in dueling with other characters thanks to the fluid and simple fighting system. Exploration and Quests\nThe expansive open environment of Hogwarts Legacy, which is full of mysteries to discover, creatures to interact with, and tasks to complete, is one of the game’s most alluring features. Players are encouraged to follow their curiosity and learn more about the world by examining hidden chambers and the Forbidden Forest. In Hogwarts Legacy, the objectives present a variety of difficulties, such as gathering components for potions, slaying monsters, and solving puzzles. Graphics and Sound\nA world that actually seems alive is created by Hogwarts Legacy’s extraordinarily immersive setting and character design. The spellcasting graphics and audio effects are spectacular, with each spell having a distinctive visual and aural impact. The English and original Welsh voice acting and music further enhance the world’s realism by giving the game’s characters and events more nuance and emotion. Character Classes and Skills\nIn Hogwarts Legacy, players may select from a number of character classes, each of which offers special talents and powers. Each class in the game, from Auror to Magizoologist, offers a unique playstyle and strategy for overcoming challenges. Players may personalize and develop their characters as they explore the environment and complete tasks thanks to the connection between character talents and advancement and experience points and level-ups. With a variety of people to engage with, such as students, teachers, and monsters, interactions with non-player characters in the game are as varied. Pros and Cons of Hogwarts Legacy\nThe game’s compelling character classes and talents, gorgeous visuals, and stunning audio are only a few of its many positive attributes. The diversity of missions and community aspects are highly valued by players. Nevertheless, some players have voiced dissatisfaction with the repetitiveness and lack of challenge of several objectives. Finally, Hogwarts Legacy provides players with a wonderful and intriguing experience rich in locations, interesting characters, and thrilling objectives. This game is full of thrill and adventure thanks to its outstanding graphics and sound, character classes and talents, and many more.\n\nSpire is an FPS about ascending a monolithic tower of unknown origin. The internals of the tower are in a constant state of flux: its structure is different on every journey. While exploring this mysterious place, players will encounter myriad dangers and illusive secrets; they must use their wits and limited resources to climb as high as possible. Curated level design\nEnvironments and the transitions between them tell a story. In Spire, we want to keep this in mind in order to create a procedural level generation that has flow and character. If the generator has created a dangerous, frantic sequence with lots of combat, it might think to then generate a scene with lower intensity to better control the emotional arc of the experience. In this way, Spire does not randomly generate levels, but rather curate an intentional experience. The resolution of the generation is very high: there are no premade rooms or scripted events. Everything, from the placement of the books on a shelf, to the shape of the walls and floors, will be generated with intention. Mystery and Mastery\nAlthough Spire is a fantasy game, we don't want people to think of goblins and elves. One thing we've talked about a lot as a team is the opportunity to come up with non-standard creatures and items. When players encounter a new enemy, it should feel like a frightening and unfamiliar thing. Likewise, by making the items strange and unexpected, the experience of finding a new treasure is heightened - it becomes one of mystery as well as reward. We want Spire to exude a sense of exploration and mystery, but also promote flashy and skillful play. In our discussions about game design, we tend to agree that the \"best\" way to play a game should look and feel cool. We had a similar philosophy in Dustforce, where we aimed to have the most efficient play style overlap with the most stylish. On Spire, one of our goals since the beginning has been to create an FPS movement system that feels snappy like Dustforce, incorporating walljumps, wall sliding, and other advanced techniques. The level generation will result in scenes that demand mastery of all sorts of skills, not just running and aiming. Players will also have access to an unusual variety of items in the game. A huge part of the mastery will be figuring out novel combinations of the left- and right-hand items to overcome different challenges.

Game List Statistics\n\nAmong the various aspects of Deep Shadows' action RPG that Alexander Khrutsky is asked about in this Xenus interview is what the gameplay will be like:\nThe gameplay in Xenus combines the features of two genres. The system of experience, number of parameters, system of weapons upgrade, the ability of communication with all characters, system of information or goods trade - all this is related to role part. Also the character can always turn to the special list of missions, read it or write new entries to the special diary. But, besides, Kevin will have to fight with different forces' representatives a lot, complete primary and secondary tasks - the first ones are important for the storyline, the second ones are completing if necessary.

Q: Can you describe a bit about how the game will play? With so many references to other game titles, it leaves me wondering what the gameplay style will be like. A: The game will be divided in two parts: the action sequences, and the question sequences. In the action sequences, you control Jeanne like in a regular platformer. You can climb ladders and walls, look at some elements in the background, talk with NPC and so on. There is no inventory, only a stamina\/life gauge that you’ll have to look for. The more you run, climb and fall from high heights, the more Jeanne will be exhausted, which can be annoying if you’re chased by an enemy. Those action sequences will also probably include some infiltration mechanics. The question sequences will pop up (kind of) randomly during the game. A question will be asked to Jeanne and depending on the player’s answer (among 2 choices), the game and scenario will take some new orientations. The thing is, we don’t talk about 10 or 20 questions in the whole game, but around 300. Theses questions will act like a psychological test on the game and will also be a way for me to tell the story. After answering a question, the player will be sent to another action sequence and so on. Q: The screens that you included in your press kit are all very intriguing! It looks as if the game will take place across many different areas. Would you like to go into any detail about the various areas available to players? A: To be perfectly true, I’m still searching what “kind” of horror I will push, and I really don’t know yet if all the visuals I sent you will be in the final game. I’m still searching, now I’m just throwing out ideas, and I’ll see which ones I’ll keep on the way. The things I can say for sure are:\n– The action will take place in a “kind of” European city (mostly inspired by Paris and Italian cities like Milan or Rome). – There won’t be any zombies in it or Silent Hill-esque monsters. I’d prefer to look more in esoteric themes. – Jeanne is an actress, so yeah, some sequences will take place in theaters or on movie sets. – The pyramid on the moon will be one of the key places of the story. There is no denying that the gameplay mechanics sound interesting. I’m digging the bits about her becoming exhausted even if that could happen at inopportune moments. We will definitely keep up with Jeanne as the game is being developed and see what sort of look the game will ultimately take on, and the various locations that will be available to players. Checkout the trailer and be sure to let us know what you think!","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:8eae1e07-5c7d-461e-bf7d-e3ff885c28ff>"]},{"passage":"Resolved minor issues with in-game text.

Introduction to Hogwarts Legacy\nA brand-new role-playing game based on the Harry Potter wizarding universe is called Hogwarts Legacy. Avalanche Software created it, and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment distributed it. Players get the opportunity to tour the expansive Hogwarts campus, take lessons, practice spells, and feel the enchantment of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in this game. Before the events of the Harry Potter books, in the 19th century, the game takes place. Players may delve into the expansive and stunning world of Hogwarts and beyond since it is set in a time of magic and mystery. Players get the option to immerse themselves in the enchantment of Hogwarts and the Harry Potter wizarding world through the game. Key Features of the Game\nSome of the key features of Hogwarts Legacy include:\n- Immersive environment and characters\n- Spellcasting mechanics\n- Character customization and progression\n- Exploration and quests\n- Multiplayer mode with co-op play and PvP options\n- Community features and future updates\nHogwarts Legacy Gameplay\nStoryline and Gameplay of Hogwarts Legacy\nSummary of the Story\nAs a recently enrolled student to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the player is the focus of the game’s narrative. The player discovers a sinister and evil plan that threatens the wizarding realm as they advance through the game. To save the wizarding community and learn the truth about the scheme, the player must use their abilities and magic. Developing and modifying characters\nIn addition to choosing their house and enrolling in classes to master spells and talents, players can build and personalize their characters. New spells, skills, and abilities will become available as the player’s character evolves and grows through time. Combat and Spellcasting Mechanics\nA unique spellcasting mechanism in the game enables players to cast spells in a variety of methods, such as through hand motions or incantations. Players can engage in dueling with other characters thanks to the fluid and simple fighting system. Exploration and Quests\nThe expansive open environment of Hogwarts Legacy, which is full of mysteries to discover, creatures to interact with, and tasks to complete, is one of the game’s most alluring features. Players are encouraged to follow their curiosity and learn more about the world by examining hidden chambers and the Forbidden Forest. In Hogwarts Legacy, the objectives present a variety of difficulties, such as gathering components for potions, slaying monsters, and solving puzzles. Graphics and Sound\nA world that actually seems alive is created by Hogwarts Legacy’s extraordinarily immersive setting and character design. The spellcasting graphics and audio effects are spectacular, with each spell having a distinctive visual and aural impact. The English and original Welsh voice acting and music further enhance the world’s realism by giving the game’s characters and events more nuance and emotion. Character Classes and Skills\nIn Hogwarts Legacy, players may select from a number of character classes, each of which offers special talents and powers. Each class in the game, from Auror to Magizoologist, offers a unique playstyle and strategy for overcoming challenges. Players may personalize and develop their characters as they explore the environment and complete tasks thanks to the connection between character talents and advancement and experience points and level-ups. With a variety of people to engage with, such as students, teachers, and monsters, interactions with non-player characters in the game are as varied. Pros and Cons of Hogwarts Legacy\nThe game’s compelling character classes and talents, gorgeous visuals, and stunning audio are only a few of its many positive attributes. The diversity of missions and community aspects are highly valued by players. Nevertheless, some players have voiced dissatisfaction with the repetitiveness and lack of challenge of several objectives. Finally, Hogwarts Legacy provides players with a wonderful and intriguing experience rich in locations, interesting characters, and thrilling objectives. This game is full of thrill and adventure thanks to its outstanding graphics and sound, character classes and talents, and many more.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:8bef5083-8fc2-4bbf-a587-ec770c148318>"]},{"passage":"Spire is an FPS about ascending a monolithic tower of unknown origin. The internals of the tower are in a constant state of flux: its structure is different on every journey. While exploring this mysterious place, players will encounter myriad dangers and illusive secrets; they must use their wits and limited resources to climb as high as possible. Curated level design\nEnvironments and the transitions between them tell a story. In Spire, we want to keep this in mind in order to create a procedural level generation that has flow and character. If the generator has created a dangerous, frantic sequence with lots of combat, it might think to then generate a scene with lower intensity to better control the emotional arc of the experience. In this way, Spire does not randomly generate levels, but rather curate an intentional experience. The resolution of the generation is very high: there are no premade rooms or scripted events. Everything, from the placement of the books on a shelf, to the shape of the walls and floors, will be generated with intention. Mystery and Mastery\nAlthough Spire is a fantasy game, we don't want people to think of goblins and elves. One thing we've talked about a lot as a team is the opportunity to come up with non-standard creatures and items. When players encounter a new enemy, it should feel like a frightening and unfamiliar thing. Likewise, by making the items strange and unexpected, the experience of finding a new treasure is heightened - it becomes one of mystery as well as reward. We want Spire to exude a sense of exploration and mystery, but also promote flashy and skillful play. In our discussions about game design, we tend to agree that the \"best\" way to play a game should look and feel cool. We had a similar philosophy in Dustforce, where we aimed to have the most efficient play style overlap with the most stylish. On Spire, one of our goals since the beginning has been to create an FPS movement system that feels snappy like Dustforce, incorporating walljumps, wall sliding, and other advanced techniques. The level generation will result in scenes that demand mastery of all sorts of skills, not just running and aiming. Players will also have access to an unusual variety of items in the game. A huge part of the mastery will be figuring out novel combinations of the left- and right-hand items to overcome different challenges. Some items will be movement focused, some will change the environment, and some will be for protecting or healing yourself. We want to make Spire a game where it's fun to watch extremely skilled players as they sprint around dashing off walls while switching items and combining their effects in clever ways. It's a joy to watch really good Quake 3 CPMA players, to see them combine trickjumping and weapon switching to pull off majestic moves - we want to let people achieve comparable levels of skill. Players can generate random spires with a seed input, or compete on leaderboards for mastery of a \"weekly spire\". We want the offline mode of the game to serve as the non-competitive mode, or as practice for the ranked challenge, while the ranked mode will be a hotly contested battle for the top-scoring slots. As well as a standard leaderboard, there will also be \"burdens\" that a player can take on at the beginning of a run to make their challenge even more difficult. Each burden will have a separate leaderboard, so that in a week it's possible for everyone to compete on the same tower in a variety of categories.

Please select the insurance type\n\nEveryone knows benefits sell. And everyone seems to sell benefits. But not all benefits sell. So what’s a seller to do? Uncover the benefits that carry the most relevance with your customers. When discussing product benefits, most companies ask only one question: What makes this product different and better than similar products? This question is important. But it focuses on the product, not on the customer. It places undeserved emphasis on the product’s uniqueness. That’s is dicey because different isn’t always better, and better products don’t always sell that way. Different is just different, and better is relative depending on which persona you sell to. Uncovering Relevant Benefits\nStart by considering the product’s attributes:\n- Features. What does the product offer? For example, “This application handles multiple users concurrently.”\n- Advantages. What do the features do? “This application provides essential information in real time.”\n- Benefits. What do the features mean? “This information will allow your managers to keep their fingers on the company’s financial pulse at all times.”\n- Motives. What do the features satisfy? “This feature will provide cost-savings, control, and efficiency.”\nThen follow these steps:\n- List everything the product does. Include standard, technical, supportive, and abstract features. - For each feature, list a relative advantage. - List each advantage’s benefits from the customer perspective. - List the motives: the benefits, features, and advantages that satisfy the customer. Case Study: The Beer Machine\nWe recently went through these steps with a new client, The Beer Machine. (We’ll relaunch its Web site with new relevant selling benefits by the fall.) The Beer Machine unit is a product that’s simple and unique by nature. As a result, our feature list was very short. Here’s what we arrived at after observing and discussing product attributes:\n- Feature: The unit is a plastic, keg-shaped tube that lets customers brew beer. - Advantage: Customers can brew beer inexpensively at home. - Benefit: Customers don’t have to build a microbrewery to brew their own beer. They save money, compared to buying premium beer. This is where most would take the above list and try to push this product on unsuspecting customers. Or worse, tout meaningless features and wedge irrelevant benefits into the product offering. Here’s where the fourth, and arguably most important, step comes in. At first blush, there were no relevant motives based on the features and advantages we identified. Saving money just didn’t seem a magnetic enough motive to move customers to spend upwards of a hundred bucks on this product. We needed to discover the benefits that existed outside the product’s physical ability and features. To do this, we had to unearth all possible and reasonable answers to the question: What benefits of this product motivate customers to buy it? You can do this by asking existing customers, at the end of the purchase, a simple, open-ended question like, “Why did you buy today?” It’s mission-critical not to present customers with multiple-choice answers. You want uninhibited, unprovoked answers that indicate each respondent’s specific motivation or reason. Later, these can be sorted and grouped into product attributes and relevant benefits. Another method is to scour correspondence from satisfied customers. Many offer clues to customer motivations. With The Beer Machine, we uncovered quite a few benefits, such as the pride of brewing for yourself, taste, bragging rights, entertaining options, and the adventure of creating unique beer recipes. These are only a few of a gaggle of relevant benefits we found during our uncovery. Some things were as suspected; not one customer mentioned saving money on beer as a motivation for the purchase.

This is something that most people get wrong. Your customer in the example above, Mario, is buying your product, the flower. However, this isn’t really what Mario cares about. What he really wants is to do is throw awesome fireballs, or in sales terms, what your customer can do with your product. If you’ve been focusing on selling the flower, you’ve been doing it wrong. What you should be focusing on, is selling the benefits. Let’s get practical. First example: Shaving Cream\nPick a product, such as a shaving cream. People don’t want the cream, they want the feeling of the smooth, soft skin that will get their spouse to make the comment, your skin feels smooth, are you using a new cream? Second example: Nonstick Pan\nLet’s pick another product straight off Amazon, a nonstick pan. Here is the description on it?s listing: The unique T-fal Thermo-spot heat indicator shows when T-fal pan is perfectly preheated for cooking. If we apply a benefits driven approach: Get delicious food every time with the Thermo-spot heat indicator that tells you when the pan is at the perfect temperature for cooking. Jason Fried, the founder of Basecamp, a popular project management tool, summed it up well: Here’s what our product can do and here’s what you can do with our product. Sound similar? But they are completely different approaches. Take a moment to review your product description, title and packaging and ask yourself: Are these benefits or features? My area of expertise is the Apple App Store, where in the past 14 months, I’ve launched 10 mobile apps, all of which have topped their category in sales. Even after launching all of these apps, I continue to revisit this question each time I come to prepare my screenshots, as it?s so easy to slip back into talking about the features. I’ll leave you with this rather mouth watering image of a paprika and sage squash soup from a new app we launched on the 1st of January. Notice, in the description, I haven?t just spoken about how quick and easy the recipes are to prepare (the features of the product), but I’ve also tied this in to the benefit, which is that it’ll fit around a busy lifestyle.

Comments that don't adhere to our Community Guidelines may be moderated or removed.\n\nThere are many ways in which to achieve this, including:\n- Photo(s): Consider an example of a collapsible step ladder. A standard white-background photo of the item would work for the hero shot, but to add extra effect you could provide supplementary photos of someone unfolding it, using it to reach somewhere high, and placing it neatly into a small cupboard afterward. - Video: While the camera never lies, video is an even more compelling way to showcase your product. Think of the common Shamwow and Slapchop infocommercials. While cheesy, they impart a sense of need by illustrating direct benefits to everyday life. 3. The Benefits\nFollowing on directly from the USP is a more detailed description of your offer’s benefits and features. By crafting an effective headline you gained the attention of your customer, and now you have to provide a little more detail to the offer to answer any questions they may have. Try to focus on answering the question “What will this do for me?”, as this will help you to write copy that speaks directly to your customers questions. 3A. Benefit summary bullet points\nIt’s important to strike a balance here and not get into so much detail that your landing page feels like it’s full of text. Write a brief one paragraph summary and 3-5 bullet points for clarity. Come back to this section many times and edit the copy to remove any bloated or unnecessary verbiage. An example, for a phone, might be:\nBad (feature based)\nOur new battery is twice as powerful as the competition’s. Better (benefit based)\nOur new battery means you’ll only need to charge your phone every couple of days. 3B. Detailed benefit and feature descriptions\nTo support your brief benefit statements you want to extend the bullet point descriptions into a more detailed overview of their purpose and benefit. A good way to approach this is to expand upon the benefits first, and then if needed, add some feature details below. The important point to remember here is that you need to communicate the benefit of your offering first. Then, and only then, do you start to add features – which are typically directed towards those who require more detail in order to make a decision. The benefits describe the problem you are solving, and the features describe what it does. 4. Social proof\nSocial proof is a powerful persuasive concept. Simply put it’s the use of social signals to illustrate that other people have bought\/consumed\/read\/participated in, what you are offering. The concept being that you are more likely to convert if you see that others before you have, and were glad they did. Basecamp does an excellent job of showing social proof on their homepage:\nThere are two key examples of social proof here:\n- The headline that points out how popular they are by virtue of the number of signups in a week\n- The personal testimonial from a customer, including a link to her company for added believability\nOther examples of social proof are:\n- Customer testimonials\n- Social signals – how well received is your offering on public networks? - A count of how many customers you have\n- Trust seals to establish security of information\n- Awards from reputable organizations\n- Customer reviews – which are very powerful when prospects are comparison shopping\n5. The conversion goal\nYour conversion goal is a term that describes what the purpose of the page is to you. It’s purely a label intended to keep you focused on this page element when designing your page. To a visitor, this is presented in the form of a Call-To-Action (CTA), which can either be a standalone button on a click-through page, or as part of a lead gen form. Your CTA is critical to conversions as it’s the target of your pages’ conversion goal – in other words, it’s what you want people to interact with on your landing page. How you design it, where you place it and what it says are all important considerations. It’s common – especially in the B2B marketplace – for the main purpose of your landing page to be lead generation. Usually this will involve asking the visitor for their Name and Email in exchange for a piece of content such as an ebook. If you are requesting data from your customers, keep the form as short as possible and include a privacy statement near the button or email address field. Poorly written CTA’s are the standard CLICK HERE or SUBMIT. A good example would be “Get your Rs.150 spa coupon” which clearly articulates what you will be receiving in exchange for your precious click.\n\nWhat is a Product? “Product is anything that can be offered to someone to satisfy a need or a want.”-Philip Kotler. What are Product Features? Product features are defined as a product’s traits or attributes that deliver value to end-users or customers. When it comes to software, product features can include any softwares functionalities, capabilities, and even its visual characteristics are known as the user interface. But the main trait of any product feature is the value it delivers to a customer. Difference between Features vs benefits ? Features refer to the specific functionalities, characteristics, or properties of the product or service. These are the tangible and measurable aspects of what the product or service can do or offer. For example, the features of a smartphone might include a high-resolution camera, a large storage capacity, and a fast processor. Benefits, on the other hand, refer to the positive outcomes or advantages that the user or customer will experience from using the product or service. Benefits are often intangible and emotional, and they focus on how the product or service can improve the customer's life or solve a problem. For example, the benefits of a smartphone might include the ability to capture high-quality photos, stay connected with friends and family, and access information quickly and easily. How to prioritize Product Features? Feature prioritization is the process of deciding which features to implement first. It determines which features should be implemented first to maximize the product's value. Prioritizing product features can be a complex process, but here are some general steps you can follow:\nIdentify the problem your product is solving: Start by understanding the problem your product is solving and the value it brings to your target market. Define your product vision: Create a product vision statement that outlines the key benefits and features of your product. Gather customer feedback: Collect feedback from your customers or potential customers through surveys, interviews, and user testing to identify the features that are most important to them. Analyze data: Analyze data on how customers are currently using your product and what features are being used the most. Prioritize features based on impact and effort: Use a prioritization framework such as the \"MoSCoW method\" (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have) or \"RICE\" (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) to prioritize features based on their potential impact and the effort required to implement them. Set goals: Set clear goals for each feature, including what problem it solves, what benefit it brings, and what metrics you will use to measure its success. Review and adjust: Regularly review and adjust your feature prioritization based on customer feedback, market changes, and other factors that may impact your product's success. What are feature prioritization frameworks? - RICE Framework\n- The MoSCoW Method\n- KANO Model\n- ICE Scoring\n- The Urgent vs. Important Matrix\n- Value Vs. Effort matrix\n- Story mapping\n- Opportunity Scoring\n- Weighted Scoring\n- Product Tree\n- Feature Voting\n\nFeatures and benefits are easily confused. As a guy, it’s easy for me to get wrapped up in the gee-whiz specifications of a product. See if these terms ring true for you:\n- Retina display\n- 1080p LCD digital display\n- 320 horsepower\n- 64 GB RAM\n- 0-60 in 4.8 seconds\n- .364 batting average\nWe’ve all seen lists like this. They often show up on websites for a product and are touted as the specifications that make you want to buy the product over a competing offering. But what does it all really mean? When I hold up one laptop computer’s specifications against those of another, I can definitely see the differences – but why should I care? When I went through my master’s degree studies, it became readily apparent of the differences between features and benefits. As my classmates would present their project or pitch, you began to understand which ones were compelling and which ones fell flat. The distinguishing characteristic, more often than not, was in the presenter’s understanding of features and benefits. Let’s look at this more closely. Features are like the specifications on the side of the box or on the product website. Features are what distinguish one product from all others in its space. A feature-rich product is one that we think of as full of the latest bells and whistles, and is often what drives the price of the product. Features are what product and software developers get hung up on quite often, and are what the naive salesperson pitches to their prospects. Lots of product packaging and advertising is consumed by the list of features. See our page on Features of Scrum. Benefits, on the other hand, are often not spelled out on a product’s label. Benefits, more than anything else, are what will compel a potential client or user to purchase a particular product. It is the overall value that they will derive from their experience with that product. For consumer-based products, the vast majority of manufacturers leave it to the purchaser to establish their own list of benefits. Quite often, all they have to gauge their assessment on is the list of features. If the consumer cannot understand what the feature does for them, then no benefit is perceived. The seasoned sales professional finds out what their customer wants and maps the features of their product to the benefits that the customer seeks. Check out out page on Benefits of Scrum. As a product owner on an Agile team, if you do not understand who your customer is, then you will have a hard time connecting features and benefits to their needs. That is why it is vital to know your customer and know their needs so that you can decide what goes in the product. Fortunately in Agile, there is a tool to help us accomplish just that – the user story. A good set of user stories make the connection between the features and benefits. User stories are in the form of “As a [role], I want [goal] so I can [reason].” For purposes of this blog, let’s rewrite this template as follows: “As a [customer], I want [feature] so I can [benefit].” This is critical to a successful product development process. You have to know why your customer might buy something before deciding what feature set to include in the product. Don’t overlook this critical component of the Agile process. Create good user stories and during your sprint reviews you’ll be able to connect features and benefits to the delight your customer.

But not all benefits sell. So what’s a seller to do? Uncover the benefits that carry the most relevance with your customers. When discussing product benefits, most companies ask only one question: What makes this product different and better than similar products? This question is important. But it focuses on the product, not on the customer. It places undeserved emphasis on the product’s uniqueness. That’s is dicey because different isn’t always better, and better products don’t always sell that way. Different is just different, and better is relative depending on which persona you sell to. Uncovering Relevant Benefits\nStart by considering the product’s attributes:\n- Features. What does the product offer? For example, “This application handles multiple users concurrently.”\n- Advantages. What do the features do? “This application provides essential information in real time.”\n- Benefits. What do the features mean? “This information will allow your managers to keep their fingers on the company’s financial pulse at all times.”\n- Motives. What do the features satisfy? “This feature will provide cost-savings, control, and efficiency.”\nThen follow these steps:\n- List everything the product does. Include standard, technical, supportive, and abstract features. - For each feature, list a relative advantage. - List each advantage’s benefits from the customer perspective. - List the motives: the benefits, features, and advantages that satisfy the customer. Case Study: The Beer Machine\nWe recently went through these steps with a new client, The Beer Machine. (We’ll relaunch its Web site with new relevant selling benefits by the fall.) The Beer Machine unit is a product that’s simple and unique by nature. As a result, our feature list was very short. Here’s what we arrived at after observing and discussing product attributes:\n- Feature: The unit is a plastic, keg-shaped tube that lets customers brew beer. - Advantage: Customers can brew beer inexpensively at home. - Benefit: Customers don’t have to build a microbrewery to brew their own beer. They save money, compared to buying premium beer. This is where most would take the above list and try to push this product on unsuspecting customers. Or worse, tout meaningless features and wedge irrelevant benefits into the product offering. Here’s where the fourth, and arguably most important, step comes in. At first blush, there were no relevant motives based on the features and advantages we identified. Saving money just didn’t seem a magnetic enough motive to move customers to spend upwards of a hundred bucks on this product. We needed to discover the benefits that existed outside the product’s physical ability and features. To do this, we had to unearth all possible and reasonable answers to the question: What benefits of this product motivate customers to buy it? You can do this by asking existing customers, at the end of the purchase, a simple, open-ended question like, “Why did you buy today?” It’s mission-critical not to present customers with multiple-choice answers. You want uninhibited, unprovoked answers that indicate each respondent’s specific motivation or reason. Later, these can be sorted and grouped into product attributes and relevant benefits. Another method is to scour correspondence from satisfied customers. Many offer clues to customer motivations. With The Beer Machine, we uncovered quite a few benefits, such as the pride of brewing for yourself, taste, bragging rights, entertaining options, and the adventure of creating unique beer recipes. These are only a few of a gaggle of relevant benefits we found during our uncovery. Some things were as suspected; not one customer mentioned saving money on beer as a motivation for the purchase. Do you know all the relevant benefits of your product or service? Find out. You may just unearth a whole new way to increase sales.

This is something that most people get wrong. Your customer in the example above, Mario, is buying your product, the flower. However, this isn’t really what Mario cares about. What he really wants is to do is throw awesome fireballs, or in sales terms, what your customer can do with your product. If you’ve been focusing on selling the flower, you’ve been doing it wrong. What you should be focusing on, is selling the benefits. Let’s get practical. First example: Shaving Cream\nPick a product, such as a shaving cream. People don’t want the cream, they want the feeling of the smooth, soft skin that will get their spouse to make the comment, your skin feels smooth, are you using a new cream? Second example: Nonstick Pan\nLet’s pick another product straight off Amazon, a nonstick pan. Here is the description on it?s listing: The unique T-fal Thermo-spot heat indicator shows when T-fal pan is perfectly preheated for cooking. If we apply a benefits driven approach: Get delicious food every time with the Thermo-spot heat indicator that tells you when the pan is at the perfect temperature for cooking. Jason Fried, the founder of Basecamp, a popular project management tool, summed it up well: Here’s what our product can do and here’s what you can do with our product. Sound similar? But they are completely different approaches. Take a moment to review your product description, title and packaging and ask yourself: Are these benefits or features? My area of expertise is the Apple App Store, where in the past 14 months, I’ve launched 10 mobile apps, all of which have topped their category in sales. Even after launching all of these apps, I continue to revisit this question each time I come to prepare my screenshots, as it?s so easy to slip back into talking about the features. I’ll leave you with this rather mouth watering image of a paprika and sage squash soup from a new app we launched on the 1st of January. Notice, in the description, I haven?t just spoken about how quick and easy the recipes are to prepare (the features of the product), but I’ve also tied this in to the benefit, which is that it’ll fit around a busy lifestyle.

What are Product Features? Product features are defined as a product’s traits or attributes that deliver value to end-users or customers. When it comes to software, product features can include any softwares functionalities, capabilities, and even its visual characteristics are known as the user interface. But the main trait of any product feature is the value it delivers to a customer. Difference between Features vs benefits ? Features refer to the specific functionalities, characteristics, or properties of the product or service. These are the tangible and measurable aspects of what the product or service can do or offer. For example, the features of a smartphone might include a high-resolution camera, a large storage capacity, and a fast processor. Benefits, on the other hand, refer to the positive outcomes or advantages that the user or customer will experience from using the product or service. Benefits are often intangible and emotional, and they focus on how the product or service can improve the customer's life or solve a problem. For example, the benefits of a smartphone might include the ability to capture high-quality photos, stay connected with friends and family, and access information quickly and easily. How to prioritize Product Features? Feature prioritization is the process of deciding which features to implement first. It determines which features should be implemented first to maximize the product's value. Prioritizing product features can be a complex process, but here are some general steps you can follow:\nIdentify the problem your product is solving: Start by understanding the problem your product is solving and the value it brings to your target market. Define your product vision: Create a product vision statement that outlines the key benefits and features of your product. Gather customer feedback: Collect feedback from your customers or potential customers through surveys, interviews, and user testing to identify the features that are most important to them. Analyze data: Analyze data on how customers are currently using your product and what features are being used the most. Prioritize features based on impact and effort: Use a prioritization framework such as the \"MoSCoW method\" (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have) or \"RICE\" (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) to prioritize features based on their potential impact and the effort required to implement them. Set goals: Set clear goals for each feature, including what problem it solves, what benefit it brings, and what metrics you will use to measure its success. Review and adjust: Regularly review and adjust your feature prioritization based on customer feedback, market changes, and other factors that may impact your product's success. What are feature prioritization frameworks? - RICE Framework\n- The MoSCoW Method\n- KANO Model\n- ICE Scoring\n- The Urgent vs. Important Matrix\n- Value Vs.

As a guy, it’s easy for me to get wrapped up in the gee-whiz specifications of a product. See if these terms ring true for you:\n- Retina display\n- 1080p LCD digital display\n- 320 horsepower\n- 64 GB RAM\n- 0-60 in 4.8 seconds\n- .364 batting average\nWe’ve all seen lists like this. They often show up on websites for a product and are touted as the specifications that make you want to buy the product over a competing offering. But what does it all really mean? When I hold up one laptop computer’s specifications against those of another, I can definitely see the differences – but why should I care? When I went through my master’s degree studies, it became readily apparent of the differences between features and benefits. As my classmates would present their project or pitch, you began to understand which ones were compelling and which ones fell flat. The distinguishing characteristic, more often than not, was in the presenter’s understanding of features and benefits. Let’s look at this more closely. Features are like the specifications on the side of the box or on the product website. Features are what distinguish one product from all others in its space. A feature-rich product is one that we think of as full of the latest bells and whistles, and is often what drives the price of the product. Features are what product and software developers get hung up on quite often, and are what the naive salesperson pitches to their prospects. Lots of product packaging and advertising is consumed by the list of features. See our page on Features of Scrum. Benefits, on the other hand, are often not spelled out on a product’s label. Benefits, more than anything else, are what will compel a potential client or user to purchase a particular product. It is the overall value that they will derive from their experience with that product. For consumer-based products, the vast majority of manufacturers leave it to the purchaser to establish their own list of benefits. Quite often, all they have to gauge their assessment on is the list of features. If the consumer cannot understand what the feature does for them, then no benefit is perceived. The seasoned sales professional finds out what their customer wants and maps the features of their product to the benefits that the customer seeks. Check out out page on Benefits of Scrum. As a product owner on an Agile team, if you do not understand who your customer is, then you will have a hard time connecting features and benefits to their needs. That is why it is vital to know your customer and know their needs so that you can decide what goes in the product. Fortunately in Agile, there is a tool to help us accomplish just that – the user story. A good set of user stories make the connection between the features and benefits. User stories are in the form of “As a [role], I want [goal] so I can [reason].” For purposes of this blog, let’s rewrite this template as follows: “As a [customer], I want [feature] so I can [benefit].” This is critical to a successful product development process. You have to know why your customer might buy something before deciding what feature set to include in the product. Don’t overlook this critical component of the Agile process. Create good user stories and during your sprint reviews you’ll be able to connect features and benefits to the delight your customer.

Call them at 970-879-0825, email email@example.com... or visit the Extension Office, 136 Sixth St.\nLast week, I took a couple hikes on some of the trails that have finally dried out from snowmelt. All along the Hinman Fisherman’s Trail was one of my favorite early season flowers, the Glacier lily (Erythronium grandiflorum). This exquisite and delicate small flower features curved yellow petals with stamens that protrude from the flower’s center. The leafless stems are 6 to 12 inches long and bend at the top giving the flower an elegant drooping profile.\nAlso called dogtooth violet and snow lily, glacier lilies provide early season food for much wildlife in our area, including bears, deer and elk who eat the corms (the swollen underground part of the stem that stores energy for next year — not quite a bulb, but close) and green seed pods, as will sheep and cattle. Ground squirrels and other rodents dig up the corms and store them for winter consumption.\nAlthough it is a really pretty flower that would look great in a meadow or garden, it generally should not be dug up from its habitats in the wild as it sends its corms deep into the soil. Most of us would end up digging up only the leaves and their stems, killing the pretty plant.\nIt’s an edible plant, as well as a spring beauty. The corm is edible raw but tastier and easier to digest when cooked. The stems and leaves of glacier lilies are also edible, although less nutritious than the corms, and can sometimes be found adding a touch of color and texture to salad greens. The seedpod, which forms after the flower bloom has ended, is also edible and can be eaten raw or cooked. It tastes a little like green beans. As with any of these wild edible plants, it’s best to eat in moderation to avoid upsetting your stomach.\nLater in the week, I hiked the Sarvis Creek trail in the southern part of the county and was enchanted by all the Mountain Bluebells (Mertensia ciliata ) in bloom along the way. A member of the Boraginaceae (forget- me-not or borage) family, this widely dispersed perennial features a four-foot tall, three-foot wide plant with blue-green leaves that feature fine hairs (hence the name ciliata) and small, bell-shaped flower clusters that start out light blue and become pinkish purple as the flower ages. It’s usually found in wet meadows and along stream banks throughout the western U.S. and is sometimes found as a single plant but often as a whole colony along a stream or wet meadow. It’s an aromatic and beautiful early season flower.\nThe bell-shaped flowers are edible, as are the leaves, but the leaves aren’t very palatable raw with their hairy coating. Native Americans had medicinal uses for this plant.\nAs the weather turns nice, be sure to get out and see all the early-season wildflowers our part of the mountains feature during this short blooming season.\nDeb Babcock is a volunteer Master Gardener through the CSU Extension Routt County.\nSupport Local Journalism\nSupport Local Journalism\nReaders around Steamboat and Routt County make the Steamboat Pilot & Today’s work possible.

The edible parts of the Glacier lily are the young shoots or bulbs, which can be eaten raw or cooked. They have a mild, nutty flavor similar to that of an artichoke or a young asparagus.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while Glacier lilies are generally considered safe to eat, there are some precautions to take. Make sure to positively identify the plant before consuming, and only eat the young shoots or bulbs, as the older parts of the plant can be toxic.

I think it could be valuable information, and you can find all kinds of info out there in \"Internetland\" discussing this sort of thing. But I thought I would add a section on this blog about this topic. The point is that if there is an emergency of any kind, you can still find food, should you need to. You just have to know what to look for. I'm learning myself on this topic, and I'm no expert. But, I think as I walk through this learning process, I would post about it. Also, if you try this, this is at your own risk. I suppose different people will have different side affects to this sort of thing. My first plant that I thought I would learn about eating was clover. Just like what is in your yard. I went out and tried this, and it tasted very much like a green, sour apples. Its safe to eat and it actually tastes pretty good raw. I would recommend washing it off first. As I'm still learning about this, you may certainly want to research for yourself the nutritional value and side affects of eating these things, like I'm doing. I do think its worth \"knowing\" this kind of information. Comments are certainly welcome as well.

Knowing what plants are edible and which ones are not can be the difference between life and death\nIdentifying edible plants\nThe first rule to follow is that if you can’t positively identify a plant, don’t eat it. A plant could be poisonous and if you identify it incorrectly, that could be a bad end. To complicate things, some plants are fine to eat when they are young but become poisonous later on in their growth. Some plants are poisonous during certain seasons. Others just have certain parts of the plants that are poisonous. While some of the plants below will not fit these descriptions, as a general rule of thumb, avoid plants that have:\n• spines, fine hairs or thorns\n• beans, bulbs or seeds inside the pod\n• a grainy head with pink, purple or black spurs\n• a three-leaf growing pattern\nWhere to find edible plants\nIf you are in a humid region, most of the plants will be in sunny areas. If you are in a dry region, the majority of the plants will be found near water sources. It’s a good idea to locate a local plant guidebook and familiarize yourself with it before you go out. You might also consider making it a part of your pack. Wild asparagus is common in many parts of North America, Europe and West Asia. It is very similar to asparagus that you find in your grocery store but has a lot thinner stalk. It typically resembles a cluster of green fingers. The mature plant is fern-like with red berries. The plant's flowers are small and green in color. Wild asparagus is most common between March and June. It is a great source of Vitamin C, thiamine and potassium. You can eat it raw or boil it. You'll most likely find it along ditches, fields, fences or at the base of ferns. These plants are known as cattails or punks in North America. They are known as bullrush or reedmace in Europe. They are typically found near freshwater rivers and ponds. They are tall plants that have a brown or bright yellow hot dog-shaped flower on the end. Most of the plant itself is edible. The best part of the plant is the stem near the bottom where the stalk is white. You can boil or eat them stem raw. Boil the leaves to eat them. If you want to eat the hot dog-looking part of the plant, you need to get it at the right time. The roots specifically, are very good sources of Vitamins A and B\nLucky for you, clovers are edible! They are typically found in an open grassy area and are better when boiled. It's best to eat the blossoms, but don't eat the brown blossoms. You'll want young and fresh white, pink or red ones. The leaves are also edible however, you'll want to look for young ones. The younger leaves are digestible raw in small amounts - half a cup or so. Older leaves will need to be cooked. You should be warned too that you'll never want to eat fermented clover leaves and clovers in warm climates can produce small amounts of cyanide so be careful. The chickweed is most common in temperate and arctic zones. The leaves are pretty thick and usually have small white flowers on the head. They are most common between May and July. Chickweed is very high in many vitamins and minerals. You can eat the leaves raw or boiled. The chickweed has a poisonous look-alike called spotted spurge. It grows close to the ground and can can even grow side by side with chickweed. Spurge exudes an acrid, white, milky sap when the leaves are cut. Chickweed does not. It should be pretty easy to identify dandelions. They are the ones that keep popping up in your perfect lawn! Your kids use them to draw with. Dandelion leaves have jagged edges, grow close to the ground and typically grow in bright areas.The great thing about them though is that they are entirely edible. You can eat the leaves while they are still young. The mature leaves aren’t bad but they will taste bitter. To get rid of the bitter taste, you can boil the leaves. You can also boil the roots before eating.\n\nIf this happens, there are some effective methods for foraging for food and identifying edible plants. Those who escaped could find themselves in an survival situation that called for finding wild food. Often, Native American children were taught about edible plants from a young age. Most people today haven't had the same learning experience, and most people are likely to fail at finding wild food. You have to have to know how to correctly identify plants, and where they grow, and finally which parts of the plants are edible. You also have to know where to look for certain foods like mosses, nuts, and berries, and more calorie-rich foods like vegetables (such as potatoes and other teubers) and even fruit that can grow wildly, depending on your location. Be sure to include include \"Wildman\" Steve Brill's site in your research. Steve is an expert in the field of identifying safe and edible plants in the wild. He is a helpful resource and has designed several programs for organizations like the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, garden clubs, or any other group interested in learning more about edible plants. Steve even provides recipes that can be made using plants found in the wild. Surprisingly, there are a lot of options for recipes using edible wild foods and plants. Learning to identify which plants are safe and which are not before the need arises is an important skill to develop. Because this ability is so important, if you find yourself in a desperate situation and are unable to positively identify a food source as safe, the best course of action is to leave it alone. * Contaminated or stagnant water: Plants growing in this environment\nSign Up for our free email newsletter packed with survival tips and tips on preparing for widespread disaster. Topics covered include survival foods, martial law, government collapse, living off the land, self defense, survival hunting, survival fishing, and MORE...\n* Commercial and residential areas: There's a good chance that plants growing in these areas will have been contaminated with dangerous levels of toxic fertilizers and pesticides. (If this is your only option, ensure that you also have a source of clean water and rinse food you feed before eating). Mushrooms: They may look good on the store shelves, but the number and varieties of wild mushrooms that are poisonous or toxic are not worth the risk to your survival. Plants such as poison ivy and related plants grow with leaves that are grouped in threes. You may feel hungry enough to eat a plant that has thorns, but by no means consider them. Bitter tasting plants or those that smell like almonds are best to be avoided. Once you have identified a potential food source, the next step is to determine if the plant is edible. There is a universal edibility test that you can perform on plants to aid in identifying safe plants. 1. Separate the food in question into its basic parts. These include the leaves, roots, stems, buds and flowers (if present). As you are separating the plant, examine it closely for insects and other pests. 2. Crush the plant material (separately) and rub the individual parts on a separate part of your skin. Patience is key in this step as you will need to wait at least eight hours to determine if you develop a negative reaction. If you experience such things as swelling, burning, itching or redness, consider the plant inedible. If your plant passes this test, continue to the next step. 3. Hold the plant to your lips for up to three minutes. If there is no sensation such as itching, burning, or tingling, consider moving to the next step. If such sensations occur, stop here. 4. Taste a small portion of the plant by placing it on your tongue for up to fifteen minutes. Any unexpected and uncomfortable sensations are an indication that you should spit the sample out immediately and seek another source. If you continue to experience no ill effects, continue to the next step. (The actual taste of the sample is not necessarily indicative of its edibility. If you encounter a plant that does not suit your taste, but passes all these steps, it is up to you to decide if it is worth the taste to eat it). 5. Slowly chew the plant in your mouth and without swallowing, hold it in your mouth for another fifteen minutes.\n\nNutrition: The flowers are loaded with Flavonoids, Methyl Salicylate, Resin and Vitamin C.\nFlavor: Pansy has a sweet grassy flavor and is used in fruit salads as well as cocktails. It also has a wintergreen taste. How to eat Pansy\nThe flower can be added to desserts and soups. The use of candied pansy is also common and this flower is widely used on cakes and cupcakes. If you eat the whole flower, then the taste is stronger but when you have the petals, it seems to be mellowed. Pansies must be eaten only when they are grown organically.

Edible parts: Its leaves and flowers are edible. One can also use its stems in cooking for flavoring. Nutrition: Lavenders are packed with Antioxidants, Calcium, Vitamin A, Phytochemicals, and Limonene. Flavor: Lavender has a floral flavor that lends a pop of unique taste to any dish or desserts. Usually the lavender flowers are minced and then sprinkled over savory foods. How to eat Lavender\nMany jams and cocktails too have traces of lavender. Some Lavender flowers are tastier than others of the same specie like Levendula x intermedia ‘Provence’ and Lavendula angustifolia. You can add lavender to make refreshing summer drinks. Some people also make lavender sugar which is used in baking breads and cakes. Just take a jar or a canister and then mix fresh or dried up lavender flowers along with a few cups of sugar. Keep the mixture inside for a week so that the sugar gets infused with the flowers. Once they are put, you can grind them together to offer a delightful flavor to your cakes.

Medicinal teas like black licorice flavored tea often feature Anise Hyssop.\n\nWarning: Eating wild plants can be dangerous. Not knowing what you are putting in your mouth could result in death. Before you go sticking random plants and berries in there, educate yourself on what to look for and what to avoid. You can start with this great article:\nSo you’re stranded in the wilderness. You consumed the last nub of your Clif Bar two days ago, and now you’re feeling famished. Civilization is still several days away, and you need to keep up your strength. The greenery all around you is looking more and more appetizing. But what to nibble on? Some plants will keep you alive and are chock full of essential vitamins and minerals, while some could make you violently ill….or even kill you. Which of course makes proper identification absolutely critical. Below we’ve given a primer on 19 common edible wild plants. Look them over and commit the plants to memory. If you’d like to discover even more edible wild plants, we suggest checking out the SAS Survival Handbook and the U.S. Army Survival Manual. In the coming months, we’ll be publishing articles on edible wild roots, berries, and fungi. So stay tuned. Plants to Avoid\nIf you can’t clearly identify a plant and you don’t know if it’s poisonous, it’s better to be safe than sorry. Steer clear from a plant if it has:\nMilky or discolored sap\nSpines, fine hairs, or thorns\nBeans, bulbs, or seeds inside pods\nBitter or soapy taste\nDill, carrot, parsnip, or parsley-like foliage\n“Almond” scent in the woody parts and leaves\nGrain heads with pink, purplish, or black spurs\nThree-leaved growth pattern\nMany toxic plants will exhibit one or more of the above characteristics. Bear in mind that some of the plants we suggest below have some of these attributes, yet they’re still edible. The characteristics listed are just guidelines for when you’re not confident about what you’re dealing with. If you want to be completely sure that an unknown plant is edible, and you have a day or two to spare, you can always perform the Universal Edibility Test.

In the 1980's, chef Alice Waters brought attention to edible flowers in American cuisine through her innovative use of them at restaurant Chez Panisse, in Berkeley, California. In addition to being visually dazzling, flowers impart unique flavors as well as nutrients to foods. Most edible flowers contain significant amounts of vitamins A and C in addition to potassium. As in fruits and vegetables, the vivid colors of flowers denote the presence of phytonutrients, reflecting the composition of compounds they contain. Many flowers can be eaten, though not all taste good. Flavors vary even among the same type of flower. The rose flower's aromas and colors vary much like its taste. Some are superb in sorbets and ice creams with their delicate, sublime flowery taste, while others are bitter, metallic and quite undesirable for culinary use. Easy to grow nasturtiums are a popular edible flower. These tender annuals come in several colors, but unlike roses, all nasturtium flowers have the same radish and cress like bite; peppery, spicy and quite unique. Experiment to find varieties that suit your own taste. Take inventory in your garden – you may already have plants with edible blossoms, though you may have to wait until the right time of season to taste them. It is extremely important to positively identify any flowers for consumption by their scientific name. Carefully evaluate the plants growing environment, and do not consume flowers exposed to pesticides, untreated manure, or other potentially toxic substances. Florist, nursery and garden center flowers are often grown with chemicals not permitted on food by the FDA. Do not ingest flowers grown along roadsides, as pesticides may have been sprayed and particles from car exhausts have built up. Ensure that you only ingest flowers intended for consumption by growing your own. When tasting new flowers, sample a small amount to be sure you are not allergic. To make sure you properly identify edible flowers and familiarize yourself with common toxic plants, consult a trusted reference. For a list of recommended plants with edible flowers and common toxic plants go to:\nAfter discovering edible flowers already growing in your garden, consider adding new ones. For a long harvesting season, include plants with a variety of bloom times from early spring through fall. Consider trees, shrubs, bulbs, veggies and herbs of both annual and perennial types. A large garden space is not required. A planting box, or small raised bed, can support a variety of edible flowers as long as it has good drainage and sunlight. Most plants with edible flowers need at least six hours of sun a day. Carefully consider where to plant, as site selection will affect overall health. Many edible flowers are easy to grow, while others require special care in our climate but are worth the extra effort. See the CSU extension website for help with plant selection, proper planting techniques, and soil preparation. For best taste harvest flowers early in the day, choosing insect and disease-free blooms. Remove stems, pistols and anthers, and on roses, remove the bitter white part at the base of the petal. Flowers bruise easily and wilt quickly so consume soon after picking. To store them place between damp paper towels in a covered container in the frige. Before using wash gently with running water. Use flowers in both sweet and savory dishes, as a garnish, in salads, butters, beverages, sorbets, ice creams and baked goods. Preserve them in syrups, liquors, jams, vinegars and oils. Store oils and vinegars in the refrigerator due to their limited shelf life. Candied flowers make delectable, intriguing decorations for desserts. Relish your own creativity in the kitchen while working with nature's most festive ingredient. When you have questions, Colorado State University Extension has research-based answers.

Damp paper towels placed in the plastic bag will help maintain high humidity. Because pollen can distract from the flavor, it's best to remove the pistils and stamens. Pollen may cause an allergic reaction for some people. Remove the sepals of all flowers except violas, Johnny-jump-ups, and pansies. For flowers such as calendula, chrysanthemum, lavender, rose, tulip, and yucca, only the flower petals are edible. The white base of the petal of many flowers may have a bitter taste and should be removed from flowers such as chrysanthemums, dianthus, marigolds, and roses. Resources: Gardeners.com; The National Gardening Association; Colorado State Extension\nSome flowers are high in nutrition as well. Roses — especially rose hips — are very high in vitamin C; marigolds and nasturtiums also contain vitamin C; and dandelion blossoms contain vitamins A and C.\nSo we’ve learned that any flower that isn't poisonous or that doesn't cause a negative reaction is considered edible. However, just because a flower is edible doesn't necessarily mean it tastes good. Before you go munching through the flower garden and window box, there are a few criteria to consider. Be sure to positively identify a flower before eating it. Some flowers have look-alikes that aren't edible. Don't eat flowers if you have asthma, allergies, or hay fever. Only eat flowers that have been grown organically so they have no pesticide residue. Collect flowers for eating in the cooler parts of the day — preferably early morning after the dew has evaporated — or late afternoon. Choose flowers that are at their peak, avoiding those that are not fully open or are starting to wilt. Fresh flowers also can be preserved for later use. Choose flowers with larger petals, such as pansies, and paint the petals with an egg-white wash. Use a soft brush and dehydrated egg whites to avoid food borne illness. These flowers are edible if the dehydrated egg powder has been pasteurized. After painting, dust the petal with super-fine granulated sugar and dry it. Store preserved flowers in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. Avoid dark-colored petals; they turn even darker with this treatment. From Wikipedia and True Food: Eight Simple Steps to a Healthier You (National Geographic, 2009) by Annie B. Bond, Melissa Breyer and Wendy Gordon. Culinary herbs are distinguished from vegetables in that, like spices, they are used in small amounts and provide flavor rather than substance to food . But we find many edible flowers among the herb world. Herbs can be perennials such as thyme or lavender , biennials such as parsley , or annuals like basil. Perennial herbs can be shrubs such as rosemary , Rosmarinus officinalis, or trees such as bay laurel , Laurus nobilis – this contrasts with botanical herbs , which by definition cannot be woody plants. Some plants are used as both herbs and spices, such as dill weed and dill seed or corianderleaves and seeds. Also, there are some herbs such as those in the mint family that are used for both culinary and medicinal purposes. Here’s a useful list of edible herb flowers and their characteristic flavor:\n1. Basil - Blossoms come in a variety of colors, from white to pink to lavender; flavor is similar to the leaves, but milder. 2. Chamomile - Small and daisylike, the flowers have a sweet flavor and are often used in tea. Ragweed sufferers may be allergic to chamomile. 3. Cilantro - Like the leaves, people either love the blossoms or hate them. The flowers share the grassy flavor of the herb. Use them fresh as they lose their charm when heated. 4. Dill - Yellow dill flowers taste much like the herb’s leaves. 5. Fennel - Yellow fennel flowers are eye candy with a subtle licorice flavor, much like the herb itself. 6.\n\nEdible Landscape Plants Which Have Edible Flowers\nIt is common for people to plant flowers just for their looks alone. What most people dont know is that some plants have edible flowers. These are usually placed in what is called an edible landscape. Flowers can really perk up a salad with beautiful color and wonderful taste. You can also use these flowers for decorating cakes and other dishes as well. Anyone who is familiar with herbology knows that flowers can be used to make teas, and the flavor extracts can be used as flavoring for candies, cakes, frostings, and other foods. Some flowers are actually quite good for your health. Roses, for example, have a very high Vitamin C content especially the rose hips. Nasturtiums and marigolds also have a good bit of Vitamin C as well. Dandelions are famous for their Vitamin A and C content. Usually, if a flower isnt toxic, then it is technically edible but it might taste horrible. This means you should use caution when choosing edible landscape plants. Some edible plants have lethal look-alikes. If you have allergies, such as hay fever, you should never try to eat flowers. Make sure before you eat any kind of flower to make sure that it has not been treated with any kind of pesticide. And be very sure to only choose fresh blooms instead of wilted ones. Only eat edible flowers in small amounts. Some people experience mild side effects if they eat large amounts of edible flowers. Never eat a flower that you know nothing about and some flowers should NEVER be eating. Lily-of-the Valley blooms are deadly. Other flowers to avoid eating are hydrangeas, azaleas, daffodils, wisteria, lupines, hyacinths, castor beans, rhododendrons, sweet peas, clematis, bleeding hearts, oleander, and calla lilies. This is only a partial list of toxic flowers. Always do research before consuming any sort of flower. You also need to check the varieties of flowers as well. This is why, for edible landscaping uses, you should concentrate on perennials. Below you will find the best edible plants to use for landscaping. Dianthus- comes in beautiful shades of pink, red and white. It taste is close to that of cloves. Daylilies- has a variety of colors and tastes like squash or asparagus. Red Clover-the flowers are a delicate red or pink. Tastes light and sweet. Tulips- the brightly colored flowers have a mildly sweet taste. Violets- flowers have a sweet, sour taste. Flowers are purple, blue, white and pink. Chives-blossoms are in pink globes. Chives are sometimes used as a substitute for onions. Bee Balm-the flowers of this beautiful plant are pink, red, white and lavender. These flowers taste a little like tea. Hollyhocks-the flowers are beautiful to look at with their bright colors, but have a bitter taste. Borage-flowers have a cucumber taste and are blue, lavender and purple. The good thing about perennials is that you dont have to plant them over and over each year because they come back on their own. So enjoy these edible additions to your edible landscape.\n\n### Question: What are the edible parts of the Glacier lily and how do they taste?\n","passages":[{"passage":"I guess I wont get into the whole background of a thought process I have on this topic, but I have decided that I'm going to learn what plants and trees are edible. I think it could be valuable information, and you can find all kinds of info out there in \"Internetland\" discussing this sort of thing.

Knowing what plants are edible and which ones are not can be the difference between life and death\nIdentifying edible plants\nThe first rule to follow is that if you can’t positively identify a plant, don’t eat it. A plant could be poisonous and if you identify it incorrectly, that could be a bad end. To complicate things, some plants are fine to eat when they are young but become poisonous later on in their growth. Some plants are poisonous during certain seasons. Others just have certain parts of the plants that are poisonous. While some of the plants below will not fit these descriptions, as a general rule of thumb, avoid plants that have:\n• spines, fine hairs or thorns\n• beans, bulbs or seeds inside the pod\n• a grainy head with pink, purple or black spurs\n• a three-leaf growing pattern\nWhere to find edible plants\nIf you are in a humid region, most of the plants will be in sunny areas. If you are in a dry region, the majority of the plants will be found near water sources. It’s a good idea to locate a local plant guidebook and familiarize yourself with it before you go out. You might also consider making it a part of your pack. Wild asparagus is common in many parts of North America, Europe and West Asia. It is very similar to asparagus that you find in your grocery store but has a lot thinner stalk. It typically resembles a cluster of green fingers. The mature plant is fern-like with red berries. The plant's flowers are small and green in color. Wild asparagus is most common between March and June. It is a great source of Vitamin C, thiamine and potassium. You can eat it raw or boil it. You'll most likely find it along ditches, fields, fences or at the base of ferns. These plants are known as cattails or punks in North America. They are known as bullrush or reedmace in Europe. They are typically found near freshwater rivers and ponds. They are tall plants that have a brown or bright yellow hot dog-shaped flower on the end. Most of the plant itself is edible. The best part of the plant is the stem near the bottom where the stalk is white. You can boil or eat them stem raw. Boil the leaves to eat them. If you want to eat the hot dog-looking part of the plant, you need to get it at the right time. The roots specifically, are very good sources of Vitamins A and B\nLucky for you, clovers are edible! They are typically found in an open grassy area and are better when boiled. It's best to eat the blossoms, but don't eat the brown blossoms. You'll want young and fresh white, pink or red ones. The leaves are also edible however, you'll want to look for young ones. The younger leaves are digestible raw in small amounts - half a cup or so. Older leaves will need to be cooked. You should be warned too that you'll never want to eat fermented clover leaves and clovers in warm climates can produce small amounts of cyanide so be careful. The chickweed is most common in temperate and arctic zones. The leaves are pretty thick and usually have small white flowers on the head. They are most common between May and July. Chickweed is very high in many vitamins and minerals. You can eat the leaves raw or boiled. The chickweed has a poisonous look-alike called spotted spurge. It grows close to the ground and can can even grow side by side with chickweed. Spurge exudes an acrid, white, milky sap when the leaves are cut. Chickweed does not. It should be pretty easy to identify dandelions. They are the ones that keep popping up in your perfect lawn! Your kids use them to draw with. Dandelion leaves have jagged edges, grow close to the ground and typically grow in bright areas.The great thing about them though is that they are entirely edible. You can eat the leaves while they are still young. The mature leaves aren’t bad but they will taste bitter. To get rid of the bitter taste, you can boil the leaves. You can also boil the roots before eating.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:f345a20f-afed-46e9-b6aa-0c37912d9413>"]},{"passage":"If this happens, there are some effective methods for foraging for food and identifying edible plants. Those who escaped could find themselves in an survival situation that called for finding wild food. Often, Native American children were taught about edible plants from a young age. Most people today haven't had the same learning experience, and most people are likely to fail at finding wild food. You have to have to know how to correctly identify plants, and where they grow, and finally which parts of the plants are edible. You also have to know where to look for certain foods like mosses, nuts, and berries, and more calorie-rich foods like vegetables (such as potatoes and other teubers) and even fruit that can grow wildly, depending on your location. Be sure to include include \"Wildman\" Steve Brill's site in your research. Steve is an expert in the field of identifying safe and edible plants in the wild. He is a helpful resource and has designed several programs for organizations like the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, garden clubs, or any other group interested in learning more about edible plants. Steve even provides recipes that can be made using plants found in the wild. Surprisingly, there are a lot of options for recipes using edible wild foods and plants. Learning to identify which plants are safe and which are not before the need arises is an important skill to develop. Because this ability is so important, if you find yourself in a desperate situation and are unable to positively identify a food source as safe, the best course of action is to leave it alone. * Contaminated or stagnant water: Plants growing in this environment\nSign Up for our free email newsletter packed with survival tips and tips on preparing for widespread disaster. Topics covered include survival foods, martial law, government collapse, living off the land, self defense, survival hunting, survival fishing, and MORE...\n* Commercial and residential areas: There's a good chance that plants growing in these areas will have been contaminated with dangerous levels of toxic fertilizers and pesticides. (If this is your only option, ensure that you also have a source of clean water and rinse food you feed before eating). Mushrooms: They may look good on the store shelves, but the number and varieties of wild mushrooms that are poisonous or toxic are not worth the risk to your survival. Plants such as poison ivy and related plants grow with leaves that are grouped in threes. You may feel hungry enough to eat a plant that has thorns, but by no means consider them. Bitter tasting plants or those that smell like almonds are best to be avoided. Once you have identified a potential food source, the next step is to determine if the plant is edible. There is a universal edibility test that you can perform on plants to aid in identifying safe plants. 1. Separate the food in question into its basic parts. These include the leaves, roots, stems, buds and flowers (if present). As you are separating the plant, examine it closely for insects and other pests. 2. Crush the plant material (separately) and rub the individual parts on a separate part of your skin. Patience is key in this step as you will need to wait at least eight hours to determine if you develop a negative reaction. If you experience such things as swelling, burning, itching or redness, consider the plant inedible. If your plant passes this test, continue to the next step. 3. Hold the plant to your lips for up to three minutes. If there is no sensation such as itching, burning, or tingling, consider moving to the next step. If such sensations occur, stop here. 4. Taste a small portion of the plant by placing it on your tongue for up to fifteen minutes. Any unexpected and uncomfortable sensations are an indication that you should spit the sample out immediately and seek another source. If you continue to experience no ill effects, continue to the next step. (The actual taste of the sample is not necessarily indicative of its edibility. If you encounter a plant that does not suit your taste, but passes all these steps, it is up to you to decide if it is worth the taste to eat it). 5. Slowly chew the plant in your mouth and without swallowing, hold it in your mouth for another fifteen minutes.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:01b3c480-5c40-4caa-be85-842e70a067d5>"]},{"passage":"Nutrition: The flowers are loaded with Flavonoids, Methyl Salicylate, Resin and Vitamin C.\nFlavor: Pansy has a sweet grassy flavor and is used in fruit salads as well as cocktails.

Nutrition: Anise hyssop contains compounds such as alpha and beta pinene, alpha terpinene, pinocamphone, and camphene. All these offer many health benefits. Flavor: Anise flavor. How to eat Anise hyssop\nThe flower is also used as garnish. Mostly its available in dry form. While making soups, the flowers are usually added as a finishing touch to lend a spicy flavor. The flowers are also cooked along with cheese, and also added when baking pita bread. Most Israeli and Greek cuisines feature this flower. Some people also make use of these flowers in making pudding and ice creams. Candies and jams too are made using these spicy flowers. Medicinal teas like black licorice flavored tea often feature Anise Hyssop.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:158209d5-1be0-42a2-b135-122722416d97>"]},{"passage":"Warning: Eating wild plants can be dangerous. Not knowing what you are putting in your mouth could result in death. Before you go sticking random plants and berries in there, educate yourself on what to look for and what to avoid. You can start with this great article:\nSo you’re stranded in the wilderness. You consumed the last nub of your Clif Bar two days ago, and now you’re feeling famished. Civilization is still several days away, and you need to keep up your strength. The greenery all around you is looking more and more appetizing. But what to nibble on? Some plants will keep you alive and are chock full of essential vitamins and minerals, while some could make you violently ill….or even kill you. Which of course makes proper identification absolutely critical. Below we’ve given a primer on 19 common edible wild plants. Look them over and commit the plants to memory. If you’d like to discover even more edible wild plants, we suggest checking out the SAS Survival Handbook and the U.S. Army Survival Manual. In the coming months, we’ll be publishing articles on edible wild roots, berries, and fungi. So stay tuned. Plants to Avoid\nIf you can’t clearly identify a plant and you don’t know if it’s poisonous, it’s better to be safe than sorry. Steer clear from a plant if it has:\nMilky or discolored sap\nSpines, fine hairs, or thorns\nBeans, bulbs, or seeds inside pods\nBitter or soapy taste\nDill, carrot, parsnip, or parsley-like foliage\n“Almond” scent in the woody parts and leaves\nGrain heads with pink, purplish, or black spurs\nThree-leaved growth pattern\nMany toxic plants will exhibit one or more of the above characteristics. Bear in mind that some of the plants we suggest below have some of these attributes, yet they’re still edible. The characteristics listed are just guidelines for when you’re not confident about what you’re dealing with.

In the 1980's, chef Alice Waters brought attention to edible flowers in American cuisine through her innovative use of them at restaurant Chez Panisse, in Berkeley, California. In addition to being visually dazzling, flowers impart unique flavors as well as nutrients to foods. Most edible flowers contain significant amounts of vitamins A and C in addition to potassium. As in fruits and vegetables, the vivid colors of flowers denote the presence of phytonutrients, reflecting the composition of compounds they contain. Many flowers can be eaten, though not all taste good. Flavors vary even among the same type of flower. The rose flower's aromas and colors vary much like its taste. Some are superb in sorbets and ice creams with their delicate, sublime flowery taste, while others are bitter, metallic and quite undesirable for culinary use. Easy to grow nasturtiums are a popular edible flower. These tender annuals come in several colors, but unlike roses, all nasturtium flowers have the same radish and cress like bite; peppery, spicy and quite unique. Experiment to find varieties that suit your own taste. Take inventory in your garden – you may already have plants with edible blossoms, though you may have to wait until the right time of season to taste them. It is extremely important to positively identify any flowers for consumption by their scientific name. Carefully evaluate the plants growing environment, and do not consume flowers exposed to pesticides, untreated manure, or other potentially toxic substances. Florist, nursery and garden center flowers are often grown with chemicals not permitted on food by the FDA. Do not ingest flowers grown along roadsides, as pesticides may have been sprayed and particles from car exhausts have built up. Ensure that you only ingest flowers intended for consumption by growing your own. When tasting new flowers, sample a small amount to be sure you are not allergic. To make sure you properly identify edible flowers and familiarize yourself with common toxic plants, consult a trusted reference. For a list of recommended plants with edible flowers and common toxic plants go to:\nAfter discovering edible flowers already growing in your garden, consider adding new ones. For a long harvesting season, include plants with a variety of bloom times from early spring through fall. Consider trees, shrubs, bulbs, veggies and herbs of both annual and perennial types. A large garden space is not required. A planting box, or small raised bed, can support a variety of edible flowers as long as it has good drainage and sunlight. Most plants with edible flowers need at least six hours of sun a day. Carefully consider where to plant, as site selection will affect overall health. Many edible flowers are easy to grow, while others require special care in our climate but are worth the extra effort. See the CSU extension website for help with plant selection, proper planting techniques, and soil preparation. For best taste harvest flowers early in the day, choosing insect and disease-free blooms. Remove stems, pistols and anthers, and on roses, remove the bitter white part at the base of the petal. Flowers bruise easily and wilt quickly so consume soon after picking. To store them place between damp paper towels in a covered container in the frige. Before using wash gently with running water. Use flowers in both sweet and savory dishes, as a garnish, in salads, butters, beverages, sorbets, ice creams and baked goods. Preserve them in syrups, liquors, jams, vinegars and oils. Store oils and vinegars in the refrigerator due to their limited shelf life. Candied flowers make delectable, intriguing decorations for desserts.

Damp paper towels placed in the plastic bag will help maintain high humidity. Because pollen can distract from the flavor, it's best to remove the pistils and stamens. Pollen may cause an allergic reaction for some people. Remove the sepals of all flowers except violas, Johnny-jump-ups, and pansies. For flowers such as calendula, chrysanthemum, lavender, rose, tulip, and yucca, only the flower petals are edible. The white base of the petal of many flowers may have a bitter taste and should be removed from flowers such as chrysanthemums, dianthus, marigolds, and roses. Resources: Gardeners.com; The National Gardening Association; Colorado State Extension\nSome flowers are high in nutrition as well. Roses — especially rose hips — are very high in vitamin C; marigolds and nasturtiums also contain vitamin C; and dandelion blossoms contain vitamins A and C.\nSo we’ve learned that any flower that isn't poisonous or that doesn't cause a negative reaction is considered edible. However, just because a flower is edible doesn't necessarily mean it tastes good. Before you go munching through the flower garden and window box, there are a few criteria to consider. Be sure to positively identify a flower before eating it. Some flowers have look-alikes that aren't edible. Don't eat flowers if you have asthma, allergies, or hay fever. Only eat flowers that have been grown organically so they have no pesticide residue. Collect flowers for eating in the cooler parts of the day — preferably early morning after the dew has evaporated — or late afternoon. Choose flowers that are at their peak, avoiding those that are not fully open or are starting to wilt. Fresh flowers also can be preserved for later use. Choose flowers with larger petals, such as pansies, and paint the petals with an egg-white wash. Use a soft brush and dehydrated egg whites to avoid food borne illness. These flowers are edible if the dehydrated egg powder has been pasteurized. After painting, dust the petal with super-fine granulated sugar and dry it. Store preserved flowers in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. Avoid dark-colored petals; they turn even darker with this treatment.

Culinary herbs are distinguished from vegetables in that, like spices, they are used in small amounts and provide flavor rather than substance to food . But we find many edible flowers among the herb world. Herbs can be perennials such as thyme or lavender , biennials such as parsley , or annuals like basil. Perennial herbs can be shrubs such as rosemary , Rosmarinus officinalis, or trees such as bay laurel , Laurus nobilis – this contrasts with botanical herbs , which by definition cannot be woody plants. Some plants are used as both herbs and spices, such as dill weed and dill seed or corianderleaves and seeds. Also, there are some herbs such as those in the mint family that are used for both culinary and medicinal purposes. Here’s a useful list of edible herb flowers and their characteristic flavor:\n1. Basil - Blossoms come in a variety of colors, from white to pink to lavender; flavor is similar to the leaves, but milder. 2. Chamomile - Small and daisylike, the flowers have a sweet flavor and are often used in tea. Ragweed sufferers may be allergic to chamomile. 3. Cilantro - Like the leaves, people either love the blossoms or hate them. The flowers share the grassy flavor of the herb. Use them fresh as they lose their charm when heated. 4. Dill - Yellow dill flowers taste much like the herb’s leaves. 5. Fennel - Yellow fennel flowers are eye candy with a subtle licorice flavor, much like the herb itself. 6.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:cdd9b017-7694-4982-a4d2-d38cb1dbe43b>"]},{"passage":"Edible Landscape Plants Which Have Edible Flowers\nIt is common for people to plant flowers just for their looks alone. What most people dont know is that some plants have edible flowers. These are usually placed in what is called an edible landscape. Flowers can really perk up a salad with beautiful color and wonderful taste. You can also use these flowers for decorating cakes and other dishes as well. Anyone who is familiar with herbology knows that flowers can be used to make teas, and the flavor extracts can be used as flavoring for candies, cakes, frostings, and other foods. Some flowers are actually quite good for your health. Roses, for example, have a very high Vitamin C content especially the rose hips. Nasturtiums and marigolds also have a good bit of Vitamin C as well. Dandelions are famous for their Vitamin A and C content. Usually, if a flower isnt toxic, then it is technically edible but it might taste horrible. This means you should use caution when choosing edible landscape plants. Some edible plants have lethal look-alikes. If you have allergies, such as hay fever, you should never try to eat flowers. Make sure before you eat any kind of flower to make sure that it has not been treated with any kind of pesticide. And be very sure to only choose fresh blooms instead of wilted ones. Only eat edible flowers in small amounts. Some people experience mild side effects if they eat large amounts of edible flowers. Never eat a flower that you know nothing about and some flowers should NEVER be eating. Lily-of-the Valley blooms are deadly. Other flowers to avoid eating are hydrangeas, azaleas, daffodils, wisteria, lupines, hyacinths, castor beans, rhododendrons, sweet peas, clematis, bleeding hearts, oleander, and calla lilies. This is only a partial list of toxic flowers. Always do research before consuming any sort of flower. You also need to check the varieties of flowers as well. This is why, for edible landscaping uses, you should concentrate on perennials. Below you will find the best edible plants to use for landscaping. Dianthus- comes in beautiful shades of pink, red and white. It taste is close to that of cloves. Daylilies- has a variety of colors and tastes like squash or asparagus. Red Clover-the flowers are a delicate red or pink. Tastes light and sweet. Tulips- the brightly colored flowers have a mildly sweet taste. Violets- flowers have a sweet, sour taste. Flowers are purple, blue, white and pink. Chives-blossoms are in pink globes. Chives are sometimes used as a substitute for onions. Bee Balm-the flowers of this beautiful plant are pink, red, white and lavender. These flowers taste a little like tea. Hollyhocks-the flowers are beautiful to look at with their bright colors, but have a bitter taste. Borage-flowers have a cucumber taste and are blue, lavender and purple. The good thing about perennials is that you dont have to plant them over and over each year because they come back on their own. So enjoy these edible additions to your edible landscape.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:2e831175-b47a-417d-90c7-f6157b9bb685>"]}]}

The records he made in the 1940s have been of major influence on jazz\nmusic. His impact on generations of pianists\nwas not just far-reaching: it was fundamental. Nat is often regarded as the man who made it possible for black musicians to break through in the U.S. music scene. He did not refuse to perform before segregated audiences, for he believed that goodwill and exhibition of his talent were more effective than formal protests in fighting racism. His approach was not always a success: he was a victim of several racial incidents throughout his life. 1919 – 1936\nNathaniel Adams Coles was born on March 17 1919* in Montgomery, Alabama. He was born in a poor family: his father, Edward James Coles sr., was a reverend, his mother Perlina Adams Coles was the choir director of her husband’s church. Even though Nat’s parents had thirteen children, only five of them made it to adulthood. Nat grew up with his brother Edward jr. and his two sisters, Eddie Mae and Evelyn. When Nat was four years old his family moved to Chicago where his father had been offered pastorship of the True Light Baptist Church. In Chicago his parents got two more boys, Issac and Lionel (better known as “Freddie”.) Nat was taught to play the piano at an early age by his mother. Perlina, determined to give her children a musical education, succeeded. Her four sons all became professional musicians. When Nat was 12 years old he regularly sung and played the organ in church. After he joined Wendell Phillips High School he was introduced to jazz music and was greatly enthusiastic about this new type of music: together with his brother Eddie he would explore the Chicago jazz scene whenever he could. In 1934 Nat organized a jazz quintet called “Nat Coles and his Royal Dukes”, as well as a 14-piece orchestra called “Rogues of Rhythm”. When Nat heard Earl Hines play one night, he was heavily impressed and driven to give his quintet a new, more rhythmic sound, much like Hines’. Later he’d say about Hines: \"It was his driving force that appealed to me ... I was just a kid and coming up, but I latched onto that new Hines style. Guess I still show the influence today.\" (-Down Beat, 1957). When Nat was 16 he joined Eddie’s band “Solid Swingers” and started performing at jazz joints throughout Chicago. It was in these joints that Nat gained his first bit of success. The (mere) success didn’t do much good to Nat’s educational career: he dropped out of High School in 1936. 1936 - 1940\nNot long after he turned 18, Nat married Nadine Robinson. They had met each other on the vaudeville “Shuffle Along”. Nadine was one of the show’s dancers, while Nat was a pianist in the vaudeville-orchestra. When the show ended the couple settled in Los Angeles. They didn’t have much money and in order to pay the rent Nat had to play the piano in local beer joints for little pay. After a year of hard work Cole’s talent was discovered by the owner of the famous Century Club, at that time the most popular hangout in L.A. for jazz musicians – Nat became a regular performer at this club. Around 1938 Nat was asked to form a quintet (that eventually became a trio as drummer Lee Young didn’t show up on the opening night.) After bassist Wesley Prince and guitarist Oscar Moore joined, the group performed at the Sewanee Inn, an L.A. nightclub. Owner of the nightclub, Bob Lewis, asked from Nat that he would carry a golden crown made of paper - this is how Nat got his nickname “King”. Nat soon got rid of the crown, but the band kept its name: the “King Cole Trio”. 1940 - 1950\nIn their early days, the King Cole Trio played instrumental jazz. After 1940 they gradually introduced vocals to their music**. December 1940 they had the opportunity to record for the Decca record company. They recorded the hit song “Sweet Lorraine” and the groups’ popularity increased dramatically. The King Cole Trio was a bit of an oddity in their days. The music scene was dominated by Big Bands and black musicians were rejected from popular clubs, racism still being very common in the early 1940s.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, for example, a new simpler Art Deco style became popular in art, jewellery, graphic design, fashion and architecture, the aesthetics of which are more dictated by compositional design characteristic of straight lines rather than the flourishes and embellishments of the Art Nouveau period popular during the Ragtime Era. It was an era in which Jazz bands and their leaders took the stage wearing smart-looking tuxedos and suits and female singers donned au current fashions. Beginning with a trend in so-called “oriental numbers” describing the far-off lands that had perfectly suited the minor keys of early jazz; Jazz music would evolve into a carefully arranged and harmonised style of swing by 1935. By the end of the Jazz Era, Jazz music would transform from pop music phenomenon to the status of de facto American classical music and composers ranging from Duke Ellington to Thelonius Monk, Miles Davis to Charlie Parker are still renown for their compositions that transcend the relatively simple format of song. But not all music from the Jazz Era was explicitly jazzy. Traditional song styles of rural America like blues, country and folk music would get the commercial treatment and then transform to cultivated commercial pop song success. In the 1940s, there would be official charts measuring the nationwide popularity of songs; with R&B and Country charts documenting their respective commercial popularity by the end of the 1940s. While Jazz genre and styles associated with it are featured in the very name of the era, not everything released during this periods was about jazz. Old methods of music production and recording pioneered during the Ragtime Era would fall by the wayside throughout the Jazz Era as new technology developed for recording and delivering music to consumers and audiences. The old business model of Tin Pan Alley song plugging from the stage would fall out of favour by the 1930s, when the theatre business slumped during the Great Depression and particularly when radio broadcasting music and variety programmes flourished. Movies musicals coming from the studios of Los Angeles found a mass audience nearly as soon as movies featured sound in the late 1920s and songs found popularity after their inclusion in movies. During this time, music business celebrity would transfer from songwriter to popular recording star or band leaders. Arranged orchestras and their bandleaders would remain popular up until the mid 1940s, thereafter, a music industry awash in popular crooners took over the music market throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s. New record labels like Okeh, Capitol, Brunswick and Decca would come onto the market and challenge older established names like Victor and Columbia, some of these new labels releasing niche specialty music that would eventually find pop success. Record companies faced the changing realities of music broadcasting when radio and eventually television brought new music directly in the homes of Americans for free. But perhaps the greatest transformation of music industry during this era was the transformation from acoustic recording and playback to electronics. It was a time period in which new inventions like speakers, radio, microphones created a much higher fidelity music product than the acoustic methods of the phonograph. Throughout the Jazz Era, technological advancement continued to bring new products and recording techniques to the music market, but this advancement also brought changes in the music market when broadcasting began to delivery music directly into the home of potential music consumers. Just as interesting as it is to investigate the trends and changes in the music industry during the Jazz Era, it is also interesting to note who is recording the music and providing the product to consumers. Throughout the era, the home piano would become something of a relic and Americans would continue to opt for purchasing pre-recorded music rather than producing it themselves at home with sheet music. Obviously, the most associated musicians of the time were band leaders and the various orchestras of the jazz and swing periods. Also prominent throughout this period in relation to jazz proper was the “age of the Soloist”  in which talented instrumentalists and scat vocalists showed their skills by improvising on melodies, a staple of the early New Orleans Jazz scene going as far back as the 1890s.\n\nNat King Cole (100 Lyrics)\nNathaniel Adams Coles (March 17, 1919 \/ February 15, 1965), known professionally as Nat \"King\" Cole, was an American United States musician who first came to prominence as a leading jazz pianist.

It helped to shift jazz from danceable popular music towards a more challenging \"musician's music.\" Differing greatly from swing, early bebop divorced itself from dance music, establishing itself more as an art form but lessening its potential popular and commercial value. Since bebop was meant to be listened to, not danced to, it used faster tempos. Beboppers introduced new forms of chromaticism and dissonance into jazz; the dissonant tritone (or \"flatted fifth\") interval became the \"most important interval of bebop\" and players engaged in a more abstracted form of chord-based improvisation which used \"passing\" chords, substitute chords, and altered chords. The style of drumming shifted as well to a more elusive and explosive style, in which the ride cymbal was used to keep time, while the snare and bass drum were used for accents. This appealed to a more specialized audiences than earlier forms of jazz, with sophisticated harmonies, fast tempos and often virtuoso musicianship. Bebop musicians often used 1930s standards, especially those from Broadway musicals, as part of their repertoire. Among standards written by bebop musicians are Gillespie's \"Salt Peanuts\" (1941) and \"A Night in Tunisia\" (1942), Parker's \"Anthropology\" (1946), \"Yardbird Suite\" (1946) and \"Scrapple from the Apple\" (1947), and Monk's \"'Round Midnight\" (1944), which is currently the most recorded jazz standard composed by a jazz musician. An early 1940s style known as \"jumping the blues\" or jump blues used small combos, uptempo music, and blues chord progressions. Jump blues drew on boogie-woogie from the 1930s. Kansas City Jazz in the 1930s as exemplified by tenor saxophonist Lester Young marked the transition from big bands to the bebop influence of the 1940s. These divergences from the jazz mainstream of the time initially met with a divided, sometimes hostile response among fans and fellow musicians, especially established swing players, who bristled at the new harmonic sounds. To hostile critics, bebop seemed to be filled with \"racing, nervous phrases\". Despite the initial friction, by the 1950s bebop had become an accepted part of the jazz vocabulary. The most influential bebop musicians included saxophonist Charlie Parker, pianists Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk, trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie and Clifford Brown, and drummer Max Roach. The swing era lasted until the mid-1940s, and produced popular tunes such as Duke Ellington's \"Cotton Tail\" (1940) and Billy Strayhorn's \"Take the 'A' Train\" (1941). When the big bands struggled to keep going during World War II, a shift was happening in jazz in favor of smaller groups. Some swing era musicians, like Louis Jordan, later found popularity in a new kind of music, called \"rhythm and blues\", that would evolve into rock and roll in the 1950s. In the late 1940s there was a revival of \"Dixieland\" music, harkening back to the original contrapuntal New Orleans style. This was driven in large part by record company reissues of early jazz classics by the Oliver, Morton, and Armstrong bands of the 1930s. There were two populations of musicians involved in the revival. One group consisted of players who had begun their careers playing in the traditional style, and were either returning to it, or continuing what they had been playing all along, such as Bob Crosby's Bobcats, Max Kaminsky, Eddie Condon, and Wild Bill Davison. Most of this group were originally Midwesterners, although there were a small number of New Orleans musicians involved. The second population of revivalists consisted of young musicians such as the Lu Watters band. By the late 1940s, Louis Armstrong's Allstars band became a leading ensemble. Through the 1950s and 1960s, Dixieland was one of the most commercially popular jazz styles in the US, Europe, and Japan, although critics paid little attention to it.\n\nHis revolutionary lineup of piano, guitar and bass in the time of the big bands became a popular set up for a jazz trio. It was emulated by many musicians, among them Art Tatum, Erroll Garner, Oscar Peterson, Ahmad Jamal, Tommy Flanagan and blues pianists Charles Brown and Ray Charles. He also performed as a pianist on sessions with Lester Young, Red Callender, and Lionel Hampton. The Page Cavanaugh Trio with the same set up as Cole came out of the chute about the same time, at the end of the war. Cole's first mainstream vocal hit was his 1943 recording of one of his compositions, \"Straighten Up and Fly Right,\" based on a black folk tale that his father had used as a theme for a sermon. Johnny Mercer invited him to record it for the fledgling Capitol Records label. It sold over 500,000 copies, and proved that folk-based material could appeal to a wide audience. Although Nat would never be considered a rocker, the song can be seen as anticipating the first rock and roll records. Indeed, Bo Diddley, who performed similar transformations of folk material, counted Cole as an influence. Beginning in the late 1940's, Cole began recording and performing more pop-oriented material for mainstream audiences, often accompanied by a string orchestra. His stature as a popular icon was cemented during this period by hits such as \"The Christmas Song\" (Cole recorded the tune four times: June 14, 1946 as a pure Trio recording; August 19, 1946 with an added string section; August 24, 1953; and again in 1961 for the double album, The Nat King Cole Story. This final version, recorded in stereo, is the one most often heard today. ), \"Nature Boy\" (1948), \"Mona Lisa\" (1950), \"Too Young\" (the #1 song in 1951), and his signature tune \"Unforgettable\" (1951). While this shift to pop music led some jazz critics and fans to accuse Cole of selling out, he never totally abandoned his jazz roots; as late as 1956, for instance, he recorded an all-jazz album, After Midnight. [Harold Arlen - It's Only a Paper Moon]\nThe change in musical tastes during the late 1950s meant that Cole's ballad singing did not sell well with younger listeners, despite a successful stab at rock n' roll with \"Send For Me\" (peaked at #6 pop). Along with his contemporaries Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett, Cole found that the pop singles chart had been almost entirely taken over by youth-oriented acts. In 1960, Nat's long-time collaborator Nelson Riddle left Capitol Records for Frank Sinatra's newly formed Reprise Records label. Riddle and Cole recorded one final hit album Wild Is Love, based on lyrics by Ray Rasch and Dotty Wayne. Cole later retooled the concept album into an off-Broadway show, I'm With You. Cole, a heavy smoker who would smoke as much as three packets of cigarettes a day, died of lung cancer on February 15, 1965, while still at the height of his singing career.

Between 1920 and the mid 1950s, the orchestrated sounds of Jazz would take over the American commercial song market. Whether the light and breezy sounds of jazz bands during the 1920s and 1930s or the lush sounds of backing orchestras of the crooner years in the 1940s and early 1950s, this was an era marked by a certain style in both music and the celebrity achieved by success of recording artists in the music industry. This essay will explore the topics of the forthcoming Pop Song History essay series on the Jazz Era, including the various ways in which American social history, music trends, music technology and music industry collide to produce commercial success of titles, fads and trends of songs. Below are the sorts of subjects which will this blog will explore in detail in the forth coming series about the Jazz Era of Pop Song History. Throughout the Jazz Era, American cultural and social history seems inextricably linked to each decade and this series will explore the changes in American society in association with the kind of songs Americans were listening to and purchasing. The 1920s would be the embodiment of the Roaring Twenties Jazz Age, flapper girls, Jazz babies and the mindset of American rebellion against the laws of Prohibition. It would also be a politically conservative time following Progressive Era reforms including seemingly endless speculation into investments and the stock market and by a Red Scare that had been “simmering just beneath the skin of American tolerance” during the early 1920s. By the early 1930s, the economic and social lives of most Americans were turned upside down imparted by a catastrophic financial collapse of the Great Depression, continued economic stagnation and a decade of government attempts to rebuild the American economy from the ashes of financial tumult. Those in the Great Plains would face environmental difficulties on agricultural life in the Plains due to an oppressive drought and the resulting Dust Bowl years. The 1940s would see the United States engaged in another World War just over twenty years after concluding the First World War. Fears of Communism would be characteristic of this time with an Iron Curtain of Soviet sphere of influence sweeping over Eastern Europe and the American paranoia of a nuclear stalemate of the Cold War with the Soviet Union; both sides stockpiling nuclear weapons and engaging in espionage. During the 1950s, financial security for many American brought an era and prosperity on a mass scale and helped to create the sort of consumerism characteristic of the modern American economy. The new mass culture of America in the 1950s would also produce angst among many children of the Jazz Era who would eventually embrace a new style of Rock and Roll music. All throughout these decades, jazz music and style would reign supreme on the music market. The Jazz Era, from beginning to end, would be characterised by style, not just musically, but also in the fashions, art, and architecture of these decades.\n\nAs both a singer and Jazz pianist of the highest caliber, Nat recorded literally thousands of songs, a staggering amount of which are well worth the listen. Over the years, there have been thousands of releases in a dazzling array of formats. If you are interested in or simply curious about Nat King Cole's music, this site is here as a handy reference! All Nat's recordings, best as I can figure it! You can find lists of tracks he recorded, as well as some information about when he recorded them, some commentary by yours truly and the original releases where applicable on albums and singles. A reference listing what information I may about the releases made during Nat's own lifetime. This section focuses on the reissues - Nat's recordings on CD and LP reissues. Tracks are listed, with some reviews, info and covers. Informal and unofficial discussions, comments about his recordings, and suggestions for finding the best of what's available now. Other topics of possible interest which may also be discussed include recording technology, the music business and other topics and performers contemporary with Nat. All this information is presented in a way which I hope will help you to make sense of it all. Some years back, about ooooh a generation ago, I was listening to a hits CD and liked one of the songs in particular. The CD notes said the track was by Nat King Cole and was from an album of his. I went online to learn more about the album and find out what else he might've recorded around that time. There were tons of \"hits\" on a search engine, a million places selling a million Nat King Cole compilations, but little useful info. As I came to enjoy more of his music, I looked further online and still didn't find much discussion about him. The situation hasn't improved all that much. So I've been trying to do something about that by making this site, which, by the way, is named after one of Nat's own instrumental compositions, A Pile 'O Cole. There are three formal discographies. Much of his recorded musical career is covered in the discographies included in the Mosaic Records and Bear Family Record box sets. The other option is in printed form from Roy Holmes. Either option is expensive and has a neccessarily limited context. Therefore, I set sights on attempting to make an informal discography online. It would be just little ole me doing it, with zero budget, very little spare time, no access to archives or Roy Holmes' work, and a partial (but not bad) collection of Nat's records. It won't ever be complete or accurate, but it can help some folks trying to make sense of the masses of issues and find the recordings they want as well as spread appreciation for Nat and his music. I'm slowly working on it in odd moments. If you can help, email me. Corrections, tips and donations ;) are gratefully welcomed. Likewise if you need information, inquiries are welcome.

Moreover, these changes were all taking place in a socio-cultural structure, which included clubs, musical journalism, the media and parallel musical associations. Expanding socio-cultural networks in the field were an important route to establishing a public profile and included other musical connections. For example, future King Crimson member (and Fripp school friend) Gordon Haskell was a member of Fleur de Lyswith connections to both established groups (The Animals) and stars-to-be (Jimi Hendrix). The departure of Peter Giles came as GGF&McD appeared on the BBC programme Colour Me Pop, which itself was a follow-up to another appearance on the BBC Radio with ‘folk singer’ Al Stewart – Bournemouth stalwart and pupil of Fripp! – and guitar experimentalist Ron Geesin. Such is the dynamic of social, cultural and biographical networking instigated for a variety of reasons: artistic, financial, personal, all framed by a general sense of individual elective affinities. But, these were both shaping themselves and being shaped by artistic traditions – musical and otherwise – that can be identified as stretching back across time and including various transnational cultural heritages. As social and personal issues were sorting themselves out between the various personalities involved, different musical styles were evidently also gaining (and losing) prominence in the mix that was eventually to become the music of King Crimson I. To sum up, in terms of the musical salience each individual member of the band brought to its musical stylization, there was: Classical– Giles, McDonald, Fripp, Lake; Jazz\/Dance– Giles, Fripp, McDonald; Pop– Lake, Giles; Folk–McDonald (Dyble). Certainly, all these styles were eventually discernable in the unique hybrid that became the sound of King Crimson I. But, by what processes? The French anthropologist Lévi-Strauss at one point describes (wo)man as a kind of bricoleurpicking up fragments of language, myths, and culture in a DIY manner in order to reformulate and re-express them for current needs. We can see such a process actualised in the compositions of King Crimson I and their prominent stylistic sources as identified so far: Folk music (now rendered misty and ethereal – I Talk to the Wind): the pastoral\/ melancholy (In the Court of the Crimson King and Epitaph); the esoteric (Moonchild and the general lyrical content); Jazz (21stCentury Schizoid Man). In sum, the In the Court of the Crimson Kingrecordings seem a perfectly realised form of these combined genres: elements including highly rhythmic jazz forms – modal, spare, focused; the epic as expressed in modal-minor keysin the melancholic, foreboding styleof the use of the mellotron (now bleached of it dance-hall string performativity and rendered bleak and emotionless); acoustic guitars and narrative forms of folk music. In sum, the fusing of the searing guitar power based on jazz\/ rock forms with classical\/ folk stylization – again highly modal and distilled, with clarity and definition, to a high-level concentrate. King Crimson I members were certainly not trapped in rigid artistic encampments but had live antennae picking up what was going on across the musical index – past, present and future. All had been ‘blown away’ by Jimi Hendrix and seduced by Sergeant Pepper. However, the precursors of all of these in terms of contemporary popular music per se, included other twentieth century styles – both English and otherwise. On the English side, was the whole tradition of British music hall and street song going back to the C19 and early C20. Increasingly, however, by the mid C20 these fashions were overshadowed by the American show, dance, and band music of the 1940s and 50s; for example, Rogers and Hammerstein, Glenn Miller, Frank Sinatra. And, as noted, such would have been at the core of the Bournemouth based repertoire at the time, which King Crimson band members would surely have imbibed. Moreover, Skiffle was then also extremely important in the 1950s with its links to American folk music, Blues and Rn’B.\n\nQ.

The records he made in the 1940s have been of major influence on jazz\nmusic. His impact on generations of pianists\nwas not just far-reaching: it was fundamental. Nat is often regarded as the man who made it possible for black musicians to break through in the U.S. music scene. He did not refuse to perform before segregated audiences, for he believed that goodwill and exhibition of his talent were more effective than formal protests in fighting racism. His approach was not always a success: he was a victim of several racial incidents throughout his life. 1919 – 1936\nNathaniel Adams Coles was born on March 17 1919* in Montgomery, Alabama. He was born in a poor family: his father, Edward James Coles sr., was a reverend, his mother Perlina Adams Coles was the choir director of her husband’s church. Even though Nat’s parents had thirteen children, only five of them made it to adulthood. Nat grew up with his brother Edward jr. and his two sisters, Eddie Mae and Evelyn. When Nat was four years old his family moved to Chicago where his father had been offered pastorship of the True Light Baptist Church. In Chicago his parents got two more boys, Issac and Lionel (better known as “Freddie”.) Nat was taught to play the piano at an early age by his mother. Perlina, determined to give her children a musical education, succeeded. Her four sons all became professional musicians. When Nat was 12 years old he regularly sung and played the organ in church. After he joined Wendell Phillips High School he was introduced to jazz music and was greatly enthusiastic about this new type of music: together with his brother Eddie he would explore the Chicago jazz scene whenever he could. In 1934 Nat organized a jazz quintet called “Nat Coles and his Royal Dukes”, as well as a 14-piece orchestra called “Rogues of Rhythm”. When Nat heard Earl Hines play one night, he was heavily impressed and driven to give his quintet a new, more rhythmic sound, much like Hines’. Later he’d say about Hines: \"It was his driving force that appealed to me ... I was just a kid and coming up, but I latched onto that new Hines style. Guess I still show the influence today.\" (-Down Beat, 1957). When Nat was 16 he joined Eddie’s band “Solid Swingers” and started performing at jazz joints throughout Chicago. It was in these joints that Nat gained his first bit of success. The (mere) success didn’t do much good to Nat’s educational career: he dropped out of High School in 1936. 1936 - 1940\nNot long after he turned 18, Nat married Nadine Robinson. They had met each other on the vaudeville “Shuffle Along”. Nadine was one of the show’s dancers, while Nat was a pianist in the vaudeville-orchestra. When the show ended the couple settled in Los Angeles. They didn’t have much money and in order to pay the rent Nat had to play the piano in local beer joints for little pay. After a year of hard work Cole’s talent was discovered by the owner of the famous Century Club, at that time the most popular hangout in L.A. for jazz musicians – Nat became a regular performer at this club. Around 1938 Nat was asked to form a quintet (that eventually became a trio as drummer Lee Young didn’t show up on the opening night.) After bassist Wesley Prince and guitarist Oscar Moore joined, the group performed at the Sewanee Inn, an L.A. nightclub. Owner of the nightclub, Bob Lewis, asked from Nat that he would carry a golden crown made of paper - this is how Nat got his nickname “King”. Nat soon got rid of the crown, but the band kept its name: the “King Cole Trio”. 1940 - 1950\nIn their early days, the King Cole Trio played instrumental jazz. After 1940 they gradually introduced vocals to their music**. December 1940 they had the opportunity to record for the Decca record company. They recorded the hit song “Sweet Lorraine” and the groups’ popularity increased dramatically. The King Cole Trio was a bit of an oddity in their days. The music scene was dominated by Big Bands and black musicians were rejected from popular clubs, racism still being very common in the early 1940s.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:2cb15f4a-7e7d-49a0-b6d8-bb71f013417f>"]},{"passage":"During the 1920s and 1930s, for example, a new simpler Art Deco style became popular in art, jewellery, graphic design, fashion and architecture, the aesthetics of which are more dictated by compositional design characteristic of straight lines rather than the flourishes and embellishments of the Art Nouveau period popular during the Ragtime Era. It was an era in which Jazz bands and their leaders took the stage wearing smart-looking tuxedos and suits and female singers donned au current fashions. Beginning with a trend in so-called “oriental numbers” describing the far-off lands that had perfectly suited the minor keys of early jazz; Jazz music would evolve into a carefully arranged and harmonised style of swing by 1935. By the end of the Jazz Era, Jazz music would transform from pop music phenomenon to the status of de facto American classical music and composers ranging from Duke Ellington to Thelonius Monk, Miles Davis to Charlie Parker are still renown for their compositions that transcend the relatively simple format of song. But not all music from the Jazz Era was explicitly jazzy. Traditional song styles of rural America like blues, country and folk music would get the commercial treatment and then transform to cultivated commercial pop song success. In the 1940s, there would be official charts measuring the nationwide popularity of songs; with R&B and Country charts documenting their respective commercial popularity by the end of the 1940s. While Jazz genre and styles associated with it are featured in the very name of the era, not everything released during this periods was about jazz. Old methods of music production and recording pioneered during the Ragtime Era would fall by the wayside throughout the Jazz Era as new technology developed for recording and delivering music to consumers and audiences. The old business model of Tin Pan Alley song plugging from the stage would fall out of favour by the 1930s, when the theatre business slumped during the Great Depression and particularly when radio broadcasting music and variety programmes flourished. Movies musicals coming from the studios of Los Angeles found a mass audience nearly as soon as movies featured sound in the late 1920s and songs found popularity after their inclusion in movies. During this time, music business celebrity would transfer from songwriter to popular recording star or band leaders. Arranged orchestras and their bandleaders would remain popular up until the mid 1940s, thereafter, a music industry awash in popular crooners took over the music market throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s. New record labels like Okeh, Capitol, Brunswick and Decca would come onto the market and challenge older established names like Victor and Columbia, some of these new labels releasing niche specialty music that would eventually find pop success. Record companies faced the changing realities of music broadcasting when radio and eventually television brought new music directly in the homes of Americans for free. But perhaps the greatest transformation of music industry during this era was the transformation from acoustic recording and playback to electronics. It was a time period in which new inventions like speakers, radio, microphones created a much higher fidelity music product than the acoustic methods of the phonograph. Throughout the Jazz Era, technological advancement continued to bring new products and recording techniques to the music market, but this advancement also brought changes in the music market when broadcasting began to delivery music directly into the home of potential music consumers. Just as interesting as it is to investigate the trends and changes in the music industry during the Jazz Era, it is also interesting to note who is recording the music and providing the product to consumers. Throughout the era, the home piano would become something of a relic and Americans would continue to opt for purchasing pre-recorded music rather than producing it themselves at home with sheet music. Obviously, the most associated musicians of the time were band leaders and the various orchestras of the jazz and swing periods. Also prominent throughout this period in relation to jazz proper was the “age of the Soloist”  in which talented instrumentalists and scat vocalists showed their skills by improvising on melodies, a staple of the early New Orleans Jazz scene going as far back as the 1890s.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e580519a-3e8b-42e9-8ae8-b97481ceabcf>"]},{"passage":"Nat King Cole (100 Lyrics)\nNathaniel Adams Coles (March 17, 1919 \/ February 15, 1965), known professionally as Nat \"King\" Cole, was an American United States musician who first came to prominence as a leading jazz pianist.

It helped to shift jazz from danceable popular music towards a more challenging \"musician's music.\" Differing greatly from swing, early bebop divorced itself from dance music, establishing itself more as an art form but lessening its potential popular and commercial value. Since bebop was meant to be listened to, not danced to, it used faster tempos. Beboppers introduced new forms of chromaticism and dissonance into jazz; the dissonant tritone (or \"flatted fifth\") interval became the \"most important interval of bebop\" and players engaged in a more abstracted form of chord-based improvisation which used \"passing\" chords, substitute chords, and altered chords. The style of drumming shifted as well to a more elusive and explosive style, in which the ride cymbal was used to keep time, while the snare and bass drum were used for accents. This appealed to a more specialized audiences than earlier forms of jazz, with sophisticated harmonies, fast tempos and often virtuoso musicianship. Bebop musicians often used 1930s standards, especially those from Broadway musicals, as part of their repertoire. Among standards written by bebop musicians are Gillespie's \"Salt Peanuts\" (1941) and \"A Night in Tunisia\" (1942), Parker's \"Anthropology\" (1946), \"Yardbird Suite\" (1946) and \"Scrapple from the Apple\" (1947), and Monk's \"'Round Midnight\" (1944), which is currently the most recorded jazz standard composed by a jazz musician. An early 1940s style known as \"jumping the blues\" or jump blues used small combos, uptempo music, and blues chord progressions. Jump blues drew on boogie-woogie from the 1930s. Kansas City Jazz in the 1930s as exemplified by tenor saxophonist Lester Young marked the transition from big bands to the bebop influence of the 1940s. These divergences from the jazz mainstream of the time initially met with a divided, sometimes hostile response among fans and fellow musicians, especially established swing players, who bristled at the new harmonic sounds. To hostile critics, bebop seemed to be filled with \"racing, nervous phrases\". Despite the initial friction, by the 1950s bebop had become an accepted part of the jazz vocabulary. The most influential bebop musicians included saxophonist Charlie Parker, pianists Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk, trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie and Clifford Brown, and drummer Max Roach. The swing era lasted until the mid-1940s, and produced popular tunes such as Duke Ellington's \"Cotton Tail\" (1940) and Billy Strayhorn's \"Take the 'A' Train\" (1941). When the big bands struggled to keep going during World War II, a shift was happening in jazz in favor of smaller groups. Some swing era musicians, like Louis Jordan, later found popularity in a new kind of music, called \"rhythm and blues\", that would evolve into rock and roll in the 1950s. In the late 1940s there was a revival of \"Dixieland\" music, harkening back to the original contrapuntal New Orleans style. This was driven in large part by record company reissues of early jazz classics by the Oliver, Morton, and Armstrong bands of the 1930s. There were two populations of musicians involved in the revival. One group consisted of players who had begun their careers playing in the traditional style, and were either returning to it, or continuing what they had been playing all along, such as Bob Crosby's Bobcats, Max Kaminsky, Eddie Condon, and Wild Bill Davison. Most of this group were originally Midwesterners, although there were a small number of New Orleans musicians involved. The second population of revivalists consisted of young musicians such as the Lu Watters band. By the late 1940s, Louis Armstrong's Allstars band became a leading ensemble. Through the 1950s and 1960s, Dixieland was one of the most commercially popular jazz styles in the US, Europe, and Japan, although critics paid little attention to it.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:f7ffb6af-5c48-4ad8-902e-4329f2a11116>"]},{"passage":"His revolutionary lineup of piano, guitar and bass in the time of the big bands became a popular set up for a jazz trio. It was emulated by many musicians, among them Art Tatum, Erroll Garner, Oscar Peterson, Ahmad Jamal, Tommy Flanagan and blues pianists Charles Brown and Ray Charles. He also performed as a pianist on sessions with Lester Young, Red Callender, and Lionel Hampton. The Page Cavanaugh Trio with the same set up as Cole came out of the chute about the same time, at the end of the war. Cole's first mainstream vocal hit was his 1943 recording of one of his compositions, \"Straighten Up and Fly Right,\" based on a black folk tale that his father had used as a theme for a sermon. Johnny Mercer invited him to record it for the fledgling Capitol Records label. It sold over 500,000 copies, and proved that folk-based material could appeal to a wide audience. Although Nat would never be considered a rocker, the song can be seen as anticipating the first rock and roll records. Indeed, Bo Diddley, who performed similar transformations of folk material, counted Cole as an influence. Beginning in the late 1940's, Cole began recording and performing more pop-oriented material for mainstream audiences, often accompanied by a string orchestra. His stature as a popular icon was cemented during this period by hits such as \"The Christmas Song\" (Cole recorded the tune four times: June 14, 1946 as a pure Trio recording; August 19, 1946 with an added string section; August 24, 1953; and again in 1961 for the double album, The Nat King Cole Story. This final version, recorded in stereo, is the one most often heard today. ), \"Nature Boy\" (1948), \"Mona Lisa\" (1950), \"Too Young\" (the #1 song in 1951), and his signature tune \"Unforgettable\" (1951). While this shift to pop music led some jazz critics and fans to accuse Cole of selling out, he never totally abandoned his jazz roots; as late as 1956, for instance, he recorded an all-jazz album, After Midnight. [Harold Arlen - It's Only a Paper Moon]\nThe change in musical tastes during the late 1950s meant that Cole's ballad singing did not sell well with younger listeners, despite a successful stab at rock n' roll with \"Send For Me\" (peaked at #6 pop). Along with his contemporaries Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett, Cole found that the pop singles chart had been almost entirely taken over by youth-oriented acts. In 1960, Nat's long-time collaborator Nelson Riddle left Capitol Records for Frank Sinatra's newly formed Reprise Records label. Riddle and Cole recorded one final hit album Wild Is Love, based on lyrics by Ray Rasch and Dotty Wayne. Cole later retooled the concept album into an off-Broadway show, I'm With You. Cole, a heavy smoker who would smoke as much as three packets of cigarettes a day, died of lung cancer on February 15, 1965, while still at the height of his singing career. The day before he died, he did a radio interview, stating: \"I am feeling better than ever. I think I've finally got this cancer licked.\" [8919 Courage \/ 8919 Nat King Cole \/ 8918 Bernstein]","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:39a7065b-7e6d-4363-aedb-f6b019d59ff0>"]},{"passage":"Nat Shapiro and Nat Hentoff, Hear Me Talkin’ to Ya: The Story of Jazz as Told by The Men Who Made It, (New York: Dover Publications, 1955), 8.

Between 1920 and the mid 1950s, the orchestrated sounds of Jazz would take over the American commercial song market. Whether the light and breezy sounds of jazz bands during the 1920s and 1930s or the lush sounds of backing orchestras of the crooner years in the 1940s and early 1950s, this was an era marked by a certain style in both music and the celebrity achieved by success of recording artists in the music industry. This essay will explore the topics of the forthcoming Pop Song History essay series on the Jazz Era, including the various ways in which American social history, music trends, music technology and music industry collide to produce commercial success of titles, fads and trends of songs. Below are the sorts of subjects which will this blog will explore in detail in the forth coming series about the Jazz Era of Pop Song History. Throughout the Jazz Era, American cultural and social history seems inextricably linked to each decade and this series will explore the changes in American society in association with the kind of songs Americans were listening to and purchasing. The 1920s would be the embodiment of the Roaring Twenties Jazz Age, flapper girls, Jazz babies and the mindset of American rebellion against the laws of Prohibition. It would also be a politically conservative time following Progressive Era reforms including seemingly endless speculation into investments and the stock market and by a Red Scare that had been “simmering just beneath the skin of American tolerance” during the early 1920s. By the early 1930s, the economic and social lives of most Americans were turned upside down imparted by a catastrophic financial collapse of the Great Depression, continued economic stagnation and a decade of government attempts to rebuild the American economy from the ashes of financial tumult. Those in the Great Plains would face environmental difficulties on agricultural life in the Plains due to an oppressive drought and the resulting Dust Bowl years. The 1940s would see the United States engaged in another World War just over twenty years after concluding the First World War. Fears of Communism would be characteristic of this time with an Iron Curtain of Soviet sphere of influence sweeping over Eastern Europe and the American paranoia of a nuclear stalemate of the Cold War with the Soviet Union; both sides stockpiling nuclear weapons and engaging in espionage. During the 1950s, financial security for many American brought an era and prosperity on a mass scale and helped to create the sort of consumerism characteristic of the modern American economy. The new mass culture of America in the 1950s would also produce angst among many children of the Jazz Era who would eventually embrace a new style of Rock and Roll music. All throughout these decades, jazz music and style would reign supreme on the music market. The Jazz Era, from beginning to end, would be characterised by style, not just musically, but also in the fashions, art, and architecture of these decades.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e580519a-3e8b-42e9-8ae8-b97481ceabcf>"]},{"passage":"As both a singer and Jazz pianist of the highest caliber, Nat recorded literally thousands of songs, a staggering amount of which are well worth the listen. Over the years, there have been thousands of releases in a dazzling array of formats. If you are interested in or simply curious about Nat King Cole's music, this site is here as a handy reference! All Nat's recordings, best as I can figure it! You can find lists of tracks he recorded, as well as some information about when he recorded them, some commentary by yours truly and the original releases where applicable on albums and singles. A reference listing what information I may about the releases made during Nat's own lifetime. This section focuses on the reissues - Nat's recordings on CD and LP reissues. Tracks are listed, with some reviews, info and covers. Informal and unofficial discussions, comments about his recordings, and suggestions for finding the best of what's available now. Other topics of possible interest which may also be discussed include recording technology, the music business and other topics and performers contemporary with Nat. All this information is presented in a way which I hope will help you to make sense of it all. Some years back, about ooooh a generation ago, I was listening to a hits CD and liked one of the songs in particular. The CD notes said the track was by Nat King Cole and was from an album of his. I went online to learn more about the album and find out what else he might've recorded around that time. There were tons of \"hits\" on a search engine, a million places selling a million Nat King Cole compilations, but little useful info. As I came to enjoy more of his music, I looked further online and still didn't find much discussion about him. The situation hasn't improved all that much. So I've been trying to do something about that by making this site, which, by the way, is named after one of Nat's own instrumental compositions, A Pile 'O Cole. There are three formal discographies. Much of his recorded musical career is covered in the discographies included in the Mosaic Records and Bear Family Record box sets. The other option is in printed form from Roy Holmes. Either option is expensive and has a neccessarily limited context. Therefore, I set sights on attempting to make an informal discography online. It would be just little ole me doing it, with zero budget, very little spare time, no access to archives or Roy Holmes' work, and a partial (but not bad) collection of Nat's records. It won't ever be complete or accurate, but it can help some folks trying to make sense of the masses of issues and find the recordings they want as well as spread appreciation for Nat and his music. I'm slowly working on it in odd moments. If you can help, email me. Corrections, tips and donations ;) are gratefully welcomed. Likewise if you need information, inquiries are welcome. Please note that replies may take some time. I should clarify, as well, that I do not sell CDs nor provide any music in any form; and I am not in any way affiliated with the Nat King Cole estate nor Capitol \/ EMI. Opinions expressed are my own unless specifically noted and do not represent the views of Capitol \/ EMI nor the Nat King Cole estate. Nat King Cole's music is one of the pleasures of this world which we all can enjoy throughout our lives. His innate gentility, artistry and dignity is also an inspiration. If this site helps anyone to gain better awareness of his recordings and helps with access to them, then it's been worth all the work. - Still trying to straighten up and fly right, A Pile o' Cole","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:a7d90d7a-e28b-42cb-bb62-f2909c66dde1>"]},{"passage":"His father was a guitarist with a terrific liking for songs however worked as a crane operator so as to fend for his family.

Moreover, these changes were all taking place in a socio-cultural structure, which included clubs, musical journalism, the media and parallel musical associations. Expanding socio-cultural networks in the field were an important route to establishing a public profile and included other musical connections. For example, future King Crimson member (and Fripp school friend) Gordon Haskell was a member of Fleur de Lyswith connections to both established groups (The Animals) and stars-to-be (Jimi Hendrix). The departure of Peter Giles came as GGF&McD appeared on the BBC programme Colour Me Pop, which itself was a follow-up to another appearance on the BBC Radio with ‘folk singer’ Al Stewart – Bournemouth stalwart and pupil of Fripp! – and guitar experimentalist Ron Geesin. Such is the dynamic of social, cultural and biographical networking instigated for a variety of reasons: artistic, financial, personal, all framed by a general sense of individual elective affinities. But, these were both shaping themselves and being shaped by artistic traditions – musical and otherwise – that can be identified as stretching back across time and including various transnational cultural heritages. As social and personal issues were sorting themselves out between the various personalities involved, different musical styles were evidently also gaining (and losing) prominence in the mix that was eventually to become the music of King Crimson I. To sum up, in terms of the musical salience each individual member of the band brought to its musical stylization, there was: Classical– Giles, McDonald, Fripp, Lake; Jazz\/Dance– Giles, Fripp, McDonald; Pop– Lake, Giles; Folk–McDonald (Dyble). Certainly, all these styles were eventually discernable in the unique hybrid that became the sound of King Crimson I. But, by what processes? The French anthropologist Lévi-Strauss at one point describes (wo)man as a kind of bricoleurpicking up fragments of language, myths, and culture in a DIY manner in order to reformulate and re-express them for current needs. We can see such a process actualised in the compositions of King Crimson I and their prominent stylistic sources as identified so far: Folk music (now rendered misty and ethereal – I Talk to the Wind): the pastoral\/ melancholy (In the Court of the Crimson King and Epitaph); the esoteric (Moonchild and the general lyrical content); Jazz (21stCentury Schizoid Man). In sum, the In the Court of the Crimson Kingrecordings seem a perfectly realised form of these combined genres: elements including highly rhythmic jazz forms – modal, spare, focused; the epic as expressed in modal-minor keysin the melancholic, foreboding styleof the use of the mellotron (now bleached of it dance-hall string performativity and rendered bleak and emotionless); acoustic guitars and narrative forms of folk music. In sum, the fusing of the searing guitar power based on jazz\/ rock forms with classical\/ folk stylization – again highly modal and distilled, with clarity and definition, to a high-level concentrate. King Crimson I members were certainly not trapped in rigid artistic encampments but had live antennae picking up what was going on across the musical index – past, present and future. All had been ‘blown away’ by Jimi Hendrix and seduced by Sergeant Pepper. However, the precursors of all of these in terms of contemporary popular music per se, included other twentieth century styles – both English and otherwise. On the English side, was the whole tradition of British music hall and street song going back to the C19 and early C20. Increasingly, however, by the mid C20 these fashions were overshadowed by the American show, dance, and band music of the 1940s and 50s; for example, Rogers and Hammerstein, Glenn Miller, Frank Sinatra. And, as noted, such would have been at the core of the Bournemouth based repertoire at the time, which King Crimson band members would surely have imbibed. Moreover, Skiffle was then also extremely important in the 1950s with its links to American folk music, Blues and Rn’B.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:b190eb39-9b20-4d84-9e7d-dcdbd8767782>"]},{"passage":"Q.

Music Experience is a subject that will allow you to increase your knowledge and understanding of music. It will help you to develop skills with music theory and practice. If you love listening to music and want to understand more about how music works, and learn how to create your own original music and perform music, Music Experience will help you to develop these skills. Please note that Music Experience is not a course of instrumental tuition, and you need to already have some knowledge of how to play an instrument or sing before you enrol in this subject. You cannot learn to play an instrument through doing this subject. Where does Music Experience lead? Music Experience will help you to develop the foundations for further study in music. It will give you experience in performance and writing original music as well as critically analysing music, and you can use this knowledge to do further music study or work towards a career in the music industry. What work will I do in Music Experience? Music Experience is based on understanding music, responding to music, and creating music. In understanding music, you will develop critical listening skills and learn the vocabulary to discuss music and analyse it in detail. Responding to music gives you the opportunity to learn from the artists who inspire you. Creating music has two main parts – performance and composition. You will be assessed on a music performance, so to do this subject you need to be able to play an instrument or sing. Composition means you will write your own music, so this is a very creative part of the course. Music writing is done using software so you do not need to know how to read music to create something original and inspiring. What do other students think about Music Experience? Stage 1 Music Experience really helped me get my basics for music theory down, and I had a great time making music on GarageBand which has led me to want to study a Diploma of Music Industry (Sound Production) after year 12.Stage 1 Music Experience student\nI really enjoyed learning to use software, being creative with songs, and doing a performance because it helped me to improve my skills.Stage 1 Music Experience student\nWhere can I find more information about Music Experience? For more detail about content and assessment, view the course information:\n- Stage 1 (Year 11)\nWho teaches Music Experience?\n\n- The Percussion party! - Popular music in the classroom (1960’s- present day) Musical futures – Part 1\nIn the Autumn term the pupils rehearse, perform and evaluate a class performance of a score called, the Percussion Party. They will show understanding of the different signs and symbols used in the score and how the different parts are performed. A brief analysis of the score will take place showing an understanding of how the piece is organised. Pupils will take responsibility for their own part by working in a group of 6 and performing the piece independently. In the term 2, pupils form a band and share some of the experiences of being in a Rock band. They study popular music from the 1960’s through the decades. Part 1 is an introduction to the instruments in a Band and how they are played. They learn the song ‘Wild Thing’ and learn the basics of playing the Bass Guitar, Electric Guitar, Drum kit and Keyboard. During lessons the pupils will rehearse with their Band and organise a performance of the song which they perform to each other. The performances are filmed and used for assessment purposes. Pupils will also learn about Guitar notation, sing popular songs together as a class, learn about song structure and how popular music developed through the decades. - Popular music in the classroom Part 2 (Musical Futures)\nIn Part 2 of Popular music in the classroom, pupils organise their own arrangement of a song of their choice. They can either choose from a selection of songs or be responsible for choosing their own and organising the different parts. This part of their learning allows the pupils to work more independently, developing already existing skills. - An investigation into the musical genre ‘Blues’\nPupils recognise the genre by listening to examples of Blues music. They identify its musical features and show understanding by performing, using the Keyboard, the 12 bar blues chord sequence. Pupils learn a simple Blues tune, compose a Blues tune and lyrics for a song. They sing a selection of songs in the Blues style and learn about the origins and history of the Blues and its influences.\n\nThis post started out much differently than it looks now. I began writing something that would look more like Week 1, Week 2, or Week 3 of my Psychology and Sociology in Music Education class, but as I kept reading and writing, I wanted to be able to tell you more about what I was thinking and less within the confines of the reading response and the paper. I’ll leave you with some of that first, traditional draft, but then transition to something that better fits what I wanted to write.

In the first part of your paper, you should (a) discuss important concepts related to one topic that was covered during Weeks 3 and 4, (b) describe some research in education (which could include music education) that addresses the topic you selected, and (c) discuss how research or theories related to that topic have influenced contemporary classroom practices, (which could include music education).

Papers should be about 1000 words, not including references. What I actually want to talk about\nBoth my Reading Response and my Paper get at the issue I want to discuss here, but the word limits and other requirements really prevented me from saying what I wanted to say: Band, Orchestra, and Choir are not enough in music education. I began having those thoughts after hearing Dr. Scott Shuler (then President of NAfME) speak at the 2011 Iowa Music Educators Association Conference. His Keynote Address was entitled \"Music Education for Life in the 21st Century: Vision and Challenges,\" and his premise was our current paradigm of general music, band, orchestra, and choir isn’t reaching enough students. I left the session as an undergraduate music education student thinking, “how can I reach more students in my program?” Unfortunately, I have not made many strides towards that goal of providing music education to more students. For this week’s paper, I cited a demographic profile of high school music ensemble students in the United States by Elpus and Abril (2011). They took data from the National Center for Education Statistics’ (part of the Institute of Education Sciences in the US Department of Education) Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 (a nationally representative study of the class of 2004 beginning their sophomore year of high school) to look at participation numbers in high school music ensembles. Of the nearly 3 million students in the study, only 21% of them participated in band, orchestra, and\/or choir their senior year. This means that more than 2.3 million students did not study music in an ensemble. Now, it is possible that some percentage of these 2.3M students did take some other music-based elective (theory, history, appreciation, etc.)\n\nShe doesnt turn off the ground for the space they feel they need to apply disciplinary frames and prior performance or project.

(Plato)\nAt Greengate Lane Academy we expect the highest aspirations for our pupils. We want all children to learn and make academic progress no matter their starting points. We have a clear vision for what we want pupils to achieve during their time at Greengate Lane and have designed our curriculum to give all pupils the knowledge, skills and understanding they will need in their future years. Purpose of Education for Music\nAt Greengate Lane Academy, music enables our children to develop their knowledge and critically engage with a wide variety of music from different cultures and time periods. These skills help children to develop their skills in music and also begin to refine their individual tastes. Regardless of how long pupils are with us, be it their full primary years or just two or three, we intend for our pupils to:\n- develop their listening and response skills;\n- compose their own music using a variety of instruments;\n- perform and share the music they have created;\n- appraise the music of their peers and other music creators;\n- be exposed to music from a variety of cultures and time periods. Music complements the vision and core values of Greengate Lane Academy. Our belief is that the Greengate Lane school values are weaved throughout our curriculum to support our pupils and our school community, our Music lessons are structured as follows:\n- SCHOLARSHIP: our music curriculum allows our children to be scholarly, they are taught the subject in depth, progressively building on prior knowledge, resulting in children remembering more and being able to articulate what that have learnt. - CURIOUSITY: music lessons encourage pupils to contribute through discussion and collaboration; pupils reflect on their own ideas and those of others, they are encouraged to ask questions and be curious. - TENACITY: the music curriculum encourages pupil to overcome challenges and learn about how to continually improve on their musical compositions based off of the opinions and advice of their peers. - ASPIRATIONAL: pupils are given the opportunity to perform their compositions to the rest of the school and at whole school events, which they will work on to perfect for extended periods of time\n- KINDNESS: lessons are structured so that children learn skills together and support each other in partner work. Our curriculum drivers (vocabulary acquisition, SMSC, cultural awareness) are at the heart of all our music lessons:\nVOCABULARY ACQUSITION: children are continually introduced to new, subject specific vocabulary which they are encouraged to use regularly. SMSC: children are introduced to many different musical genres and encouraged to appraise these, forming opinions on what they like, dislike and appreciate the composition and creativity of the music they are surrounded by. CUTLURAL AWARENESS: as part of the music curriculum, children are introduced to music from a variety of different cultures and time periods, whilst being encouraged to analyse the similarities and differences these have from each other. At Greengate Lane Academy, we teach music through the Charanga scheme. The scheme provides teachers with carefully sequenced week-by-week lessons for each year group in the school, from ages 5–11. It has lesson plans, assessment, clear progression, and engaging and exciting whiteboard resources for every lesson. The Scheme supports all the requirements of the national curriculum and is in line with published Ofsted guidance. In EYFS children will focus on:\n- Listening and Responding\n- Exploring and Creating Singing\n- Sharing and Performing\nIn Key Stage 1 and 2 children will focus on:\n- Listening and appraising\n- Musical activities (games, singing, playing instruments, improvisation, composition)\n- Performing and Sharing\nThese are taught across the school; learning deepens and broadens in each year group. Lessons are delivered by class teachers to their own classes each week in order to teach the required knowledge and skills in a developmental and age-appropriate way. In addition to this, in Year 4\/5 the children have the opportunity to learn Samba Drumming with a specialist teacher. Impact of the Curriculum\nIn music, teachers assess pupils’ learning in lessons and adapt their teaching to be responsive to pupils understanding. As the curriculum progresses it is increasingly more challenging and pupils have the opportunity to review and extend their understanding over time as well as combine and apply different aspects of knowledge an skills development.\n\nOn Monday, July 31 we were treated to a performance by the Endeavour College Year 9 band. They shared with us what they have been learning in music. The interaction and teaching with our students was a highlight. They encouraged students to learn music and shared their enthusiasm for playing and performing. We even learnt a little bit about conducting! Thank you to the music teachers from Endeavour and especially the students for their engaging performance. We loved this opportunity to see some old scholars and for learning which comes from our Connected school’s relationship.

Music Experience is a subject that will allow you to increase your knowledge and understanding of music. It will help you to develop skills with music theory and practice. If you love listening to music and want to understand more about how music works, and learn how to create your own original music and perform music, Music Experience will help you to develop these skills. Please note that Music Experience is not a course of instrumental tuition, and you need to already have some knowledge of how to play an instrument or sing before you enrol in this subject. You cannot learn to play an instrument through doing this subject. Where does Music Experience lead? Music Experience will help you to develop the foundations for further study in music. It will give you experience in performance and writing original music as well as critically analysing music, and you can use this knowledge to do further music study or work towards a career in the music industry. What work will I do in Music Experience? Music Experience is based on understanding music, responding to music, and creating music. In understanding music, you will develop critical listening skills and learn the vocabulary to discuss music and analyse it in detail. Responding to music gives you the opportunity to learn from the artists who inspire you. Creating music has two main parts – performance and composition. You will be assessed on a music performance, so to do this subject you need to be able to play an instrument or sing. Composition means you will write your own music, so this is a very creative part of the course. Music writing is done using software so you do not need to know how to read music to create something original and inspiring. What do other students think about Music Experience? Stage 1 Music Experience really helped me get my basics for music theory down, and I had a great time making music on GarageBand which has led me to want to study a Diploma of Music Industry (Sound Production) after year 12.Stage 1 Music Experience student\nI really enjoyed learning to use software, being creative with songs, and doing a performance because it helped me to improve my skills.Stage 1 Music Experience student\nWhere can I find more information about Music Experience?

They will show understanding of the different signs and symbols used in the score and how the different parts are performed. A brief analysis of the score will take place showing an understanding of how the piece is organised. Pupils will take responsibility for their own part by working in a group of 6 and performing the piece independently. In the term 2, pupils form a band and share some of the experiences of being in a Rock band. They study popular music from the 1960’s through the decades. Part 1 is an introduction to the instruments in a Band and how they are played. They learn the song ‘Wild Thing’ and learn the basics of playing the Bass Guitar, Electric Guitar, Drum kit and Keyboard. During lessons the pupils will rehearse with their Band and organise a performance of the song which they perform to each other. The performances are filmed and used for assessment purposes. Pupils will also learn about Guitar notation, sing popular songs together as a class, learn about song structure and how popular music developed through the decades. - Popular music in the classroom Part 2 (Musical Futures)\nIn Part 2 of Popular music in the classroom, pupils organise their own arrangement of a song of their choice. They can either choose from a selection of songs or be responsible for choosing their own and organising the different parts. This part of their learning allows the pupils to work more independently, developing already existing skills. - An investigation into the musical genre ‘Blues’\nPupils recognise the genre by listening to examples of Blues music. They identify its musical features and show understanding by performing, using the Keyboard, the 12 bar blues chord sequence. Pupils learn a simple Blues tune, compose a Blues tune and lyrics for a song. They sing a selection of songs in the Blues style and learn about the origins and history of the Blues and its influences.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:d68a0bd3-b674-45bf-b15e-75cce0480a7f>"]},{"passage":"This post started out much differently than it looks now. I began writing something that would look more like Week 1, Week 2, or Week 3 of my Psychology and Sociology in Music Education class, but as I kept reading and writing, I wanted to be able to tell you more about what I was thinking and less within the confines of the reading response and the paper. I’ll leave you with some of that first, traditional draft, but then transition to something that better fits what I wanted to write. Week 4 began looking at education and music education through a sociological lens. This week we specifically looked at identity, community, and music making. We dove into another of our main texts, Sociology for Music Teachers: Practical Applications. then looked at Identity, Music, Schools, and Community.

The purpose of the assignment is to demonstrate an understanding of the course content, as well as an ability to relate findings from empirical research to classroom practice. In the first part of your paper, you should (a) discuss important concepts related to one topic that was covered during Weeks 3 and 4, (b) describe some research in education (which could include music education) that addresses the topic you selected, and (c) discuss how research or theories related to that topic have influenced contemporary classroom practices, (which could include music education). In the remainder of the paper, you will either describe how your own classroom practices reflect research related to your topic, or discuss how the research that you read may lead to a change in how you approach teaching. Papers should be about 1000 words, not including references. What I actually want to talk about\nBoth my Reading Response and my Paper get at the issue I want to discuss here, but the word limits and other requirements really prevented me from saying what I wanted to say: Band, Orchestra, and Choir are not enough in music education. I began having those thoughts after hearing Dr. Scott Shuler (then President of NAfME) speak at the 2011 Iowa Music Educators Association Conference. His Keynote Address was entitled \"Music Education for Life in the 21st Century: Vision and Challenges,\" and his premise was our current paradigm of general music, band, orchestra, and choir isn’t reaching enough students. I left the session as an undergraduate music education student thinking, “how can I reach more students in my program?” Unfortunately, I have not made many strides towards that goal of providing music education to more students. For this week’s paper, I cited a demographic profile of high school music ensemble students in the United States by Elpus and Abril (2011). They took data from the National Center for Education Statistics’ (part of the Institute of Education Sciences in the US Department of Education) Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 (a nationally representative study of the class of 2004 beginning their sophomore year of high school) to look at participation numbers in high school music ensembles. Of the nearly 3 million students in the study, only 21% of them participated in band, orchestra, and\/or choir their senior year. This means that more than 2.3 million students did not study music in an ensemble. Now, it is possible that some percentage of these 2.3M students did take some other music-based elective (theory, history, appreciation, etc.)","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:6586bab0-49df-4973-b82e-fb5ea2d7adac>"]},{"passage":"She doesnt turn off the ground for the space they feel they need to apply disciplinary frames and prior performance or project.

(Plato)\nAt Greengate Lane Academy we expect the highest aspirations for our pupils. We want all children to learn and make academic progress no matter their starting points. We have a clear vision for what we want pupils to achieve during their time at Greengate Lane and have designed our curriculum to give all pupils the knowledge, skills and understanding they will need in their future years. Purpose of Education for Music\nAt Greengate Lane Academy, music enables our children to develop their knowledge and critically engage with a wide variety of music from different cultures and time periods. These skills help children to develop their skills in music and also begin to refine their individual tastes. Regardless of how long pupils are with us, be it their full primary years or just two or three, we intend for our pupils to:\n- develop their listening and response skills;\n- compose their own music using a variety of instruments;\n- perform and share the music they have created;\n- appraise the music of their peers and other music creators;\n- be exposed to music from a variety of cultures and time periods. Music complements the vision and core values of Greengate Lane Academy. Our belief is that the Greengate Lane school values are weaved throughout our curriculum to support our pupils and our school community, our Music lessons are structured as follows:\n- SCHOLARSHIP: our music curriculum allows our children to be scholarly, they are taught the subject in depth, progressively building on prior knowledge, resulting in children remembering more and being able to articulate what that have learnt. - CURIOUSITY: music lessons encourage pupils to contribute through discussion and collaboration; pupils reflect on their own ideas and those of others, they are encouraged to ask questions and be curious. - TENACITY: the music curriculum encourages pupil to overcome challenges and learn about how to continually improve on their musical compositions based off of the opinions and advice of their peers. - ASPIRATIONAL: pupils are given the opportunity to perform their compositions to the rest of the school and at whole school events, which they will work on to perfect for extended periods of time\n- KINDNESS: lessons are structured so that children learn skills together and support each other in partner work. Our curriculum drivers (vocabulary acquisition, SMSC, cultural awareness) are at the heart of all our music lessons:\nVOCABULARY ACQUSITION: children are continually introduced to new, subject specific vocabulary which they are encouraged to use regularly. SMSC: children are introduced to many different musical genres and encouraged to appraise these, forming opinions on what they like, dislike and appreciate the composition and creativity of the music they are surrounded by. CUTLURAL AWARENESS: as part of the music curriculum, children are introduced to music from a variety of different cultures and time periods, whilst being encouraged to analyse the similarities and differences these have from each other. At Greengate Lane Academy, we teach music through the Charanga scheme. The scheme provides teachers with carefully sequenced week-by-week lessons for each year group in the school, from ages 5–11. It has lesson plans, assessment, clear progression, and engaging and exciting whiteboard resources for every lesson. The Scheme supports all the requirements of the national curriculum and is in line with published Ofsted guidance. In EYFS children will focus on:\n- Listening and Responding\n- Exploring and Creating Singing\n- Sharing and Performing\nIn Key Stage 1 and 2 children will focus on:\n- Listening and appraising\n- Musical activities (games, singing, playing instruments, improvisation, composition)\n- Performing and Sharing\nThese are taught across the school; learning deepens and broadens in each year group. Lessons are delivered by class teachers to their own classes each week in order to teach the required knowledge and skills in a developmental and age-appropriate way. In addition to this, in Year 4\/5 the children have the opportunity to learn Samba Drumming with a specialist teacher. Impact of the Curriculum\nIn music, teachers assess pupils’ learning in lessons and adapt their teaching to be responsive to pupils understanding. As the curriculum progresses it is increasingly more challenging and pupils have the opportunity to review and extend their understanding over time as well as combine and apply different aspects of knowledge an skills development.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:c2d5d4e8-2807-4a22-ae7c-cdd39f01e14a>"]},{"passage":"On Monday, July 31 we were treated to a performance by the Endeavour College Year 9 band.

{"id":28,"doc_id":"<urn:uuid:7ef0cf77-a406-4750-beb2-be4205253fd4>","text":"I don´t know what its like to have a child with CP, and I don’t know what it feels like when you are told the diagnosis for the first time. However, I think we can all benefit from talking about the hard things, the things that we would rather keep to ourselves, in the fear that the other person might not understand. Be that as a parent to their child, or a person with CP to their parent.\nThroughout the years I’ve battled with my own emotions and thoughts about having CP. I somehow managed to get through it all and end up as a relatively happy person on the other end, even though some parts of the struggle never ends. When talking to my own parents, and other parents, both through this blog and outside of it I gained a deeper appreciation of all the battles they have fought with themselves. Out of these conversations, there seems to be three different categories to group these difficult feelings and thoughts into: Guilt, Loss and Regret.\nGuilt relating to the CP can be a few different things. It could be that you as a parent feel that you are to blame for your child ending up with CP, that it is somehow your fault. Maybe, you didn’t do enough? What if you only had eaten healthier? Maybe you were too stressed during pregnancy? Well let you tell you right now, it´s not your fault. Cerebral Palsy is not genetic, and its causes are difficult to ascertain exactly, but we know it comes directly from a lack of oxygen to the brain. Your child loves you, as the one that cares for them deeper than anyone else, they don’t blame you for the CP, neither should you.\nGuilt can come creeping in other forms as well, maybe you feel bad for not being there as much as you could for your child, or maybe you feel you are overprotecting them or sheltering them too much? As someone with CP, I can say that I have felt overprotected or sheltered at times. And sure, it may let to some outbursts of anger or frustration, especially in my teens. Do I hold any sort of grudge or feeling of resentment towards my parents today for this? Not at all.\nI’m not a parent myself so I can’t speak from experience, but it seems from my viewpoint that parents of kids with CP balance on a constant tightrope, on one side they want to grant their child freedom and independence, so that they won’t feel so isolated or dependent on you as a parent. On the other side, you know the reality of the world out there, of the bullies, of the judgment of others and of the mental hardships they may have to endure when they realize their dream may be stopped because of the CP.\nI think what you have to consider when facing all these difficult situations is this. Your child loves you, admires you, and looks to you for guidance, even if they don’t tell you straight up. They know you are there for them if things get really though. Life didn’t prepare you for the challenge of having a child with Cerebral Palsy. And considering that both the parent and child are just thrown into it head first with no instruction manual, you are doing pretty awesome, just getting through the day.\nJust as other parents who do not have a child with CP, do not understand the perspective that you as a parent come from. It’s important to remember that we, as people with CP, view that as “normal”. Life with Cerebral Palsy is all I know, and most likely is all I will ever know, and I am completely fine with that. But because of that it shapes my view on life, my motivations and my thoughts, that are going to be different than an able bodied in some way. Which leads me to the next topic Loss and Regret.\nP.S. Feel free to read this post entirely about guilt as it relates to CP.\nLoss And Regret\nI decided to group these two together because they pretty closely related. If you feel loss as a parent because of the CP, chances are regret follows closely behind. It’s completely normal for you to feel loss as a parent, to feel loss that your son or daughter won’t have the life of an able bodied child. To feel the loss of that opportunity taken away from you, and taken away from you’re child. Its also normal for you to feel regret about all the things in daily life that your child may miss out on as a result of the CP. This does not make you a bad parent. Nor does it make you selfish.\nAs someone with CP, I’ve felt loss and regret to because of the CP. I felt loss when I realized I had to give up my dream as a kid to become a professional soccer player, and I’ve felt both feelings when I couldn’t participate in something with my friends or felt like an outsider. But as I’ve gotten older I’ve grown to appreciate something that has always been there as a part of the CP, and that is my initial perspective on life.\nAs I mentioned above, life with CP is all I know, and all I will know. This has some really good benefits. It means that I won’t always feel the need or desire to be closer to “normal”, simply because I have no idea what it means to not have CP, I can’t really imagine it. This can create some conflicts between the person with CP and their loved ones too. Where the parents for example may want to push their child to exercise more, stretch more, or try harder to walk or walk better, the person with CP, may be content with their functional level as it is, and may not see the point.\nWe both have a responsibility here. The parent should try to understand this, that we don’t necessarily want to be just like an able bodied. Some may, but that may lead to more harm than good. You can’t change the CP; you can’t cure it, at least not right now. And because of that, if you are constantly want something you cannot have, and constantly hating what you have and what you are, you are going to be pretty miserable. Therefore, I would advise you, as a parent to help your child accept their CP rather than fight it. It is not your enemy, nor is it theirs, its a part of them.\nAs people with CP we also have to understand that even if we don’t always see the change the point in stretching or exercises, or even surgeries, we should try to think of the fact that we want to stay happy in the future. The work that you put down now, can be really important later down the road. I used to hate this kind of reasoning however, and I am not expecting you to like it either, so if that doesn’t motivate you, try to find smaller more achievable goals of improvement that you can see in a shorter time period.\nAlso, remember that because your parents want you to exercise more, or walk better or what have you, it doesn’t mean they think you aren’t good enough, you are, and its not about that. They view life from their perspective, and what they have been able to do and enjoy in life, they just want you to feel many of the joys in life that they have, because they love you, not because they don’t think you’re good enough.\nIt is my hope that we can continue to learn from each other, and grow together. That way, we can heal each other and the scars that may open, so I hope you will accept and embrace this open letter as my contribution towards that.\nIf you have had any of these feelings and experiences, either as a parent or as someone with CP, please feel free to comment below and share on your favourite social media, it really helps us grow and write more of these articles!

But Melody refuses to be defined by cerebral palsy. And she’s determined to let everyone know it…somehow. In this breakthrough story—reminiscent of The Diving Bell and the Butterfly—from multiple Coretta Scott King Award-winner Sharon Draper, readers will come to know a brilliant mind and a brave spirit who will change forever how they look at anyone with a disability. The future is brighter then ever for children with cerebral palsy — the most common developmental disability among young people today. With advances in medicine, early intervention, and therapy, these children can maximize their potential and lead healthy, rewarding lives. But perhaps the most important influence of all comes from parents who provide constant support and encouragement. This is essential reading for all parents who want to learn about cerebral palsy and how it will affect their child and family. 16. Teaching Motor Skills to Children With Cerebral Palsy And Similar Movement Disorders: A Guide for Parents And Professionals\nAll children with cerebral palsy and other conditions that result in gross motor delays need help and reinforcement to learn basic motor skills, usually with assistance from a physical therapist. Because the degree of developmental delay varies greatly from child to child, a thorough motor evaluation is an important step before establishing a specific therapy plan. The book is organized into three parts. In the first, the authors describe specific patterns of involvement (hemiplegia, diplegia, quadriplegia), explain the medical and psychosocial implications of these conditions, and tell parents how to be effective advocates for their child. In the second part, the authors provide a wealth of practical advice about caregiving from nutrition to mobility. Part three features an extensive alphabetically arranged encyclopedia that defines and describes medical terms and diagnoses, medical and surgical procedures, and orthopedic and other assistive devices. Also included are lists of resources and recommended reading. Nathan struggles with cerebral palsy. The plot centers around a wounded owl that ends up in the care of the boy’s neighbor, Miss Sandy, a Raptor Rehabilitator.

Cerebral Palsy nonprofit foundation led by parents, with a focus on the Prevention, Treatment and Cure of Cerebral Palsy\nThe AACPDM provides multidisciplinary scientific education for health professionals and promote excellence in research and services for the benefit of people with cerebral palsy and childhood-onset disabilities.\n\nAccording to the CDC, the best approach involves creating a treatment plan as soon as a diagnosis of cerebral palsy has been made. A team of medical professionals works with the baby’s family to come up with a program that will improve the child’s physical, intellectual, and emotional condition. Treatment plans are based on the type, symptoms and severity of CP and other associated conditions and vary from child to child. Generally, treatment includes medications, physical and occupational therapy, the use of mobility aids such as wheelchairs, braces, crutches, and surgery. Other elements of a life treatment plan include early childhood intervention and placement in special education classes to help a child participate in school and be able to learn and interact with other children. In addition, child psychologists can help children with CP to cope with stress, depression, and other emotional problems caused by their disability.\n\nNo one can relate to what I go through. You need to have a good caregiver since they do not come cheap owing to what it entails to bring her up. You constantly have to plan for the future since there is the overwhelming thought of what would happen should I die tomorrow as my child is totally dependent on me; it’s a very scary feeling.

They should always know that they are their children’s best advocates, listen to their instincts, and research as much as possible about the different treatment options available out there. There are various organisations like Bravehearts Special Needs Association where parents of children living with CP have come together to support each other and raise awareness.\n\nRaising a child with Cerebral Palsy (CP) can seem like an insurmountable task, and it will definitely be a challenge, but that’s no reason to despair. There are a lot of misconceptions about raising a child with CP. Knowing all of the facts might help alleviate the stress of raising a child with special needs. What Is Cerebral Palsy? CP is a group of disorders that affects the white matter in the brain, which is responsible for balance, coordination, and fine motor control. Cerebral palsy is known to be the most common cause of motor disability in children, and it affects an estimated 500,000 Americans. There are three main types of CP:\n- Spastic CP (stiff muscles)\n- Dyskinetic CP (involuntary movement)\n- Ataxic CP (difficulty with coordination and balance)\nEvery case of CP is different in terms of type and severity, so knowing exactly what kind of CP your child is dealing with and how severe it is can help guide your expectations and manage your anxiety. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Spastic CP is the most common type and comprises about 80% of all people with CP. There are three types of spastic CP: spastic diplegia\/diparesis, spastic hemiplegia\/hemiparesis, and spastic quadriplegia\/quadriparesis. People with spastic diplegia\/diparesis experience muscle stiffness mainly in the legs. There may or may not be stiffness in the arms, but if there is, it will be milder. Spastic hemiplegia\/hemiparesis affects the arms more than the legs, and its symptoms manifest on one side of the body only. According to the Children’s Hemiplegia and Stroke Association (CHASA), the symptoms of spastic hemiplegia will manifest on the side of the body opposite the affected side of the brain; this can help you determine which side of your child’s brain is affected and what to expect from your child from a developmental point of view. This is the most severe form of spastic CP and affects all the body’s limbs. People with spastic quadriplegia\/quadriparesis are usually unable to walk; spastic quadriplegia\/quadriparesis is often coupled with intellectual disabilities and seizures. Dyskinetic CP causes involuntary movements in the hands and feet, which can make it difficult to walk or sit. Dyskinetic CP may also affect the tongue and cheeks, responsible for all mouth movements, such as swallowing and speaking. Ataxic CP affects coordination. This means that people with this form of CP have difficulty with fine motor skills such as writing, tying their shoes, or reaching for objects. Ataxic CP might make a person’s walk awkward, but it doesn’t usually prevent people from walking altogether. Some of the most frightening worries about raising a child with CP are misconceptions. Instead of fearing the worst, you should keep in mind that CP may not limit your child’s ability as much as you’d think. Try not to cater to any of the following fallacies:\nA Child With CP Can’t Succeed\nFor the vast majority of kids with CP, there’s no truth to this whatsoever. Less than half of the children with CP show intellectual impairment, so don’t make the mistake of giving your child limitations they may not actually have. A Child With CP Will Be Unable to Work\nA difficult situation should not turn into something impossible. If you help your child develop a skill or passion, their failure is far from guaranteed. As long as you keep an open and positive mind, whilst always encouraging and supporting your child, you may be surprised to see what they are capable of. A Child With CP Can’t Have a Normal Life\nFirstly, there is no such thing. Secondly, coming up with limitations and barriers for your child could turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy, so be patient and maintain a positive attitude. Your child’s future depends on having you in their corner. ” This article is a collaboration with a freelance writer and follows The Haitian Times publishing guidelines”\n\nThe perinatal history must have information regarding the child's gestation age during birth, the kind of delivery that was performed, the weight of the child during birth and complications during the surgery (if any). This should include all the essential information regarding the child's motor growth, language adaptation, and completion of milestones from birth till the time of evaluation. The age usually by which motor milestones are achieved include control over the head at the age of 2-3 months, rolling of the body at the age of 4-5 months, sitting at the age of 6 or 7 months and walking by the time the child is of 1 year (Maenneret al., 2016.). Infants with CP may suggest poor growth of motor skills and early hand preference by the age of 18 months suggesting the underdevelopment of the other side. The social skills of these children along with their performance at schools and academics should be reviewed. Cognitive and educational testing can be put into use to determine if speech therapy or physical therapy is required. An assessment of patient's dependence on equipment and communication devices should be reviewed such as computerized speech programs, walkers, wheelchairs, etc. Physical indicators of CP may include difficulty and pain in joint movements, spastic muscles, delay in the growth of cognitive and motor skills and repetitive reflexes. Before the examination, observation may suggest abnormalities in neck tone, stiff posture, low strength, and difficulty in coordination of hand and limb movements.The overall pattern should be reviewed and each joint both in the upper and lower body must be assessed like the hip, knee, and foot. Children suffering from cerebral palsy are required to have a proper life care plan consisting big diagnosis, a group of specialists, thorough research, observation and evaluation and laying down of a set of goals (Benevides et al., 2017). Everything mentioned above will eventually lead up to those goals\nThe purpose of care plan goals\nThe first and most important reason to maintain a care plan is to have something which will act like a map leading to a child's healthy life. It will consist of everything that is needed to provide him\/her with a good life, from diagnosis to evaluation to an assessment of his strengths and weaknesses. Goals may be short term and related to the health and well being of the child. They might also be long term like securing a job. Categories of goals\nSince the condition of children with cerebral palsy is a complex one, simply organizing goals is crucial to make it a little easier to understand and comprehend. Managing of the initial disability\nCP is complex but the initial goal should be to manage the primary condition of the child. To achieve this objective the taking the assistance of a neurologist or paediatrician is very important. CP has several co-existing conditions like movement and coordination disorders, seizures, underdevelopment of cognitive skills. Laying down of goals to improve in these is the next crucial step. Problems in mobility are the most common issue that children with cerebral palsy face and most of them are unable to walk. Goals addressing improving mobility are important to make the child feel comfortable and confident. Pain is the component that comes hand in hand with Cerebral Palsy. Stiff muscles, spastic movement and inability to move causes pain to the child and setting goals to manage pain is extremely important to help him become more comfortable thereby helping in achieving other simultaneous goals. Working on communication\nA child diagnosed with cerebral Palsy not only has underdeveloped cognitive skills but also has tremendous difficulty in communicating as their vocal cords have been affected adversely due to their medical condition. If a child is struggling with speech and language, including this goal is important to achieve a greater ability to communicate through speech or other ways. A child suffering from cerebral palsy may have difficulties in making social interactions with people. He may have trouble in making conversation with his peers. But because this is an important aspect of life, it is important for the child to connect with others and for that reason the setting of this goal is important. Other goals that are also important are goals related to education, self-care, maximizing the good qualities of life and independence. The setting of goals is an important aspect of life for everybody but a child born with a disability, it is more important. To give a child a better chance at living a good life, taking off these goals seriously is very important.\n\nArt can serve as a bridge for your child to express feelings, thoughts and more.

Before becoming a full-time mother and advocate, Sandy worked for 14 years in depression research. “Every aspect of our lives is shaped by the over 1200 hours a year it takes to take our daughter with cerebral palsy to her more than 200 appointments with 9 doctors and 5 therapists; deal with insurance; find needed equipment and services; do therapy with her at home; address her behavioral issues; spend extra time on her school work; supervise almost everything she does to maintain her safety and maximize her independence; and make the extra time for her to do things other kids do so quickly and easily. It means staying where we have supportive family and have learned how to navigate systems; giving up my career because of my family’s needs; and becoming an advocate for families with children with special needs. It has forced us to acquire new skills and re-focused our lives. It has made us intentional parents who constantly think about how we can keep our daughter’s needs from taking over our family while making sure her brother’s needs are also met. It has brought us closer together as a family, taught us the value of family and community, and helped us learn to cherish every little thing about both of our children. Having a child with special needs changed everything: because I now know the effect raising a child with special needs has on the entire family and how hard it is to learn about and access the multitude of needed services, I feel compelled to help other families through this process any way I can.

Cynthia knew there was a possibility that Cathryn could have problems—she was born prematurely—but she never imagined the difficulties that lay ahead. Though she seemed fine at first, after several months, Cynthia began to notice that sometimes Cathryn seemed very floppy, almost like a rag doll. Other times, she seemed to stiffen. \"I knew she wasn't hitting the same growth and motor milestones like my older daughter,\" said Cynthia. Several doctor's appointments later, she finally received a diagnosis of cerebral palsy. Cynthia immediately went to the Internet searching for anything and everything about cerebral palsy. She felt frustrated by the limited information she could find that specifically addressed the needs of parents. Cynthia expressed her frustrations to Cathryn's orthopedic surgeon, who connected Cynthia with another parent of a child with cerebral palsy: Anna Marie Champion. Cynthia and Anna Marie set out to understand how they could help educate other families about prevention and treatment. But they weren't sure where to start. They read about spina bifida, a disabling birth defect of the spine, and about the discovery that folic acid can help reduce it. \"That's what we want—our 'folic acid'—something that could help prevent cerebral palsy,\" Cynthia said. \"We found out that we can't prevent and treat cerebral palsy without understanding the root causes of it.\" Tracking the number of children with cerebral palsy is the first step to understanding the characteristics and finding the root causes. \"Watching Cathryn go through the pain of two major orthopedic surgeries at such a young age is hard, but we know it's necessary to help her walk,\" said Cynthia.

Cerebral Palsy Causes\nMost commonly, cerebral palsy develops in the fetus, but the condition can also develop during infancy or early childhood. The causes of CP are not always identifiable, but many cases can be linked to infection or exposure to radiation during pregnancy, fetal growth restriction or complications during labor. Birth asphyxia, seizures, respiratory problems and low blood sugar during or immediately after birth can also lead to CP. In very young children, cerebral palsy can be caused by lead poisoning, stroke, near drowning, encephalitis, meningitis, shaken baby syndrome or jaundice. Rarely, cases of CP are genetic. Cerebral Palsy Diagnosis\nCerebral palsy is usually initially diagnosed by a physical exam assessing general movements, especially in children 4 months of age or younger. Neuroimaging tests such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to determine the cause of CP, but are usually not necessary for a diagnosis. Cerebral Palsy Treatment\nTreatment of cerebral palsy focuses on maximizing independence for each individual with the disorder. Treatment of CP is a lifelong process that can include medication, therapy, surgery or a combination. Therapy can begin as soon as CP is diagnosed and may include physical therapy, speech therapy and therapy for social and emotional development. Medications can help improve muscle stiffness or pain, while braces can assist with walking and other movements. In some cases, orthopedic surgery can repair dislocated hips or abnormal spine curvature such as scoliosis.

Medical professionals do not yet have a clear view of how to manage all the issues relevant to an individual with cerebral palsy. Health problems such as arthritis, strained organs, and fatigue can plague patients as they grow older. The disease can affect a person's ability to work or care for him or herself, and aging parents and family members may no longer be available for intensive assistance and care. Ongoing research in the field provides physicians, patients, and their families with hope for new treatments and therapies. A better understanding of the disease will serve to address many of the challenges faced by cerebral palsy in adults. A person diagnosed with cerebral palsy most often experiences an extreme strain on the systems of his or her body. Premature aging is normal and frequently seen in adults with this condition by the time they reach the age of 40. Organs like the heart and lungs may not have developed fully, and have spent decades working in overdrive to respond to the demands of the body. Arthritis is also commonly associated with cerebral palsy in adults, due to years of disproportionate joint compression and a limited range of motion. Cerebral palsy in adults can cause fatigue that interferes with the individual's ability to work or care for him or herself. The complications associated with cerebral palsy and growing older, like premature aging and arthritis, can be draining and difficult to live with. Additionally, the simple act of moving around requires a person living with this disease to exert three to five times the amount of energy as an average person. This extreme strain can limit a person's ability to work in traditional employment. A person affected by cerebral palsy may have had a large support system as a child. Parents are usually available and involved in the upbringing of a child with a developmental or physical illness, and cerebral palsy is no exception. One challenge that occurs with cerebral palsy in adults is the aging of the patient's parents and family. The individual's parents may no longer be living, or could be handling their own medical issues related to aging. Cerebral palsy support groups can be instrumental in assisting an adult living with the disease. Without support, it can be difficult for the person to navigate issues like employment, health care, insurance, and living arrangements. Group homes are an option for people who suffer from severe cerebral palsy, and require daily, hands-on assistance with self-care and feeding.\n\n### Question: What are the three main emotional challenges parents face when having a child with Cerebral Palsy?","passages":[{"passage":"Skip to Content\nHome > Wellness > Health Library > Social and Emotional Concerns of People With Cerebral Palsy\ncerebral palsy (CP) share many of the social and\nemotional concerns of others the same age, such as wanting to fit in with peers\nand develop friendships.

Teaching Motor Skills to Children With Cerebral Palsy And Similar Movement Disorders: A Guide for Parents And Professionals\nAll children with cerebral palsy and other conditions that result in gross motor delays need help and reinforcement to learn basic motor skills, usually with assistance from a physical therapist. Because the degree of developmental delay varies greatly from child to child, a thorough motor evaluation is an important step before establishing a specific therapy plan. The book is organized into three parts. In the first, the authors describe specific patterns of involvement (hemiplegia, diplegia, quadriplegia), explain the medical and psychosocial implications of these conditions, and tell parents how to be effective advocates for their child. In the second part, the authors provide a wealth of practical advice about caregiving from nutrition to mobility.

There are a lot of misconceptions about raising a child with CP. Knowing all of the facts might help alleviate the stress of raising a child with special needs. What Is Cerebral Palsy? CP is a group of disorders that affects the white matter in the brain, which is responsible for balance, coordination, and fine motor control. Cerebral palsy is known to be the most common cause of motor disability in children, and it affects an estimated 500,000 Americans. There are three main types of CP:\n- Spastic CP (stiff muscles)\n- Dyskinetic CP (involuntary movement)\n- Ataxic CP (difficulty with coordination and balance)\nEvery case of CP is different in terms of type and severity, so knowing exactly what kind of CP your child is dealing with and how severe it is can help guide your expectations and manage your anxiety. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Spastic CP is the most common type and comprises about 80% of all people with CP. There are three types of spastic CP: spastic diplegia\/diparesis, spastic hemiplegia\/hemiparesis, and spastic quadriplegia\/quadriparesis. People with spastic diplegia\/diparesis experience muscle stiffness mainly in the legs. There may or may not be stiffness in the arms, but if there is, it will be milder. Spastic hemiplegia\/hemiparesis affects the arms more than the legs, and its symptoms manifest on one side of the body only. According to the Children’s Hemiplegia and Stroke Association (CHASA), the symptoms of spastic hemiplegia will manifest on the side of the body opposite the affected side of the brain; this can help you determine which side of your child’s brain is affected and what to expect from your child from a developmental point of view. This is the most severe form of spastic CP and affects all the body’s limbs. People with spastic quadriplegia\/quadriparesis are usually unable to walk; spastic quadriplegia\/quadriparesis is often coupled with intellectual disabilities and seizures. Dyskinetic CP causes involuntary movements in the hands and feet, which can make it difficult to walk or sit. Dyskinetic CP may also affect the tongue and cheeks, responsible for all mouth movements, such as swallowing and speaking. Ataxic CP affects coordination. This means that people with this form of CP have difficulty with fine motor skills such as writing, tying their shoes, or reaching for objects. Ataxic CP might make a person’s walk awkward, but it doesn’t usually prevent people from walking altogether. Some of the most frightening worries about raising a child with CP are misconceptions. Instead of fearing the worst, you should keep in mind that CP may not limit your child’s ability as much as you’d think. Try not to cater to any of the following fallacies:\nA Child With CP Can’t Succeed\nFor the vast majority of kids with CP, there’s no truth to this whatsoever. Less than half of the children with CP show intellectual impairment, so don’t make the mistake of giving your child limitations they may not actually have. A Child With CP Will Be Unable to Work\nA difficult situation should not turn into something impossible. If you help your child develop a skill or passion, their failure is far from guaranteed. As long as you keep an open and positive mind, whilst always encouraging and supporting your child, you may be surprised to see what they are capable of. A Child With CP Can’t Have a Normal Life\nFirstly, there is no such thing. Secondly, coming up with limitations and barriers for your child could turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy, so be patient and maintain a positive attitude. Your child’s future depends on having you in their corner. ” This article is a collaboration with a freelance writer and follows The Haitian Times publishing guidelines”","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ebe68948-380b-4167-ba10-e3246f84b471>"]},{"passage":"The perinatal history must have information regarding the child's gestation age during birth, the kind of delivery that was performed, the weight of the child during birth and complications during the surgery (if any). This should include all the essential information regarding the child's motor growth, language adaptation, and completion of milestones from birth till the time of evaluation. The age usually by which motor milestones are achieved include control over the head at the age of 2-3 months, rolling of the body at the age of 4-5 months, sitting at the age of 6 or 7 months and walking by the time the child is of 1 year (Maenneret al., 2016.). Infants with CP may suggest poor growth of motor skills and early hand preference by the age of 18 months suggesting the underdevelopment of the other side. The social skills of these children along with their performance at schools and academics should be reviewed. Cognitive and educational testing can be put into use to determine if speech therapy or physical therapy is required. An assessment of patient's dependence on equipment and communication devices should be reviewed such as computerized speech programs, walkers, wheelchairs, etc. Physical indicators of CP may include difficulty and pain in joint movements, spastic muscles, delay in the growth of cognitive and motor skills and repetitive reflexes. Before the examination, observation may suggest abnormalities in neck tone, stiff posture, low strength, and difficulty in coordination of hand and limb movements.The overall pattern should be reviewed and each joint both in the upper and lower body must be assessed like the hip, knee, and foot. Children suffering from cerebral palsy are required to have a proper life care plan consisting big diagnosis, a group of specialists, thorough research, observation and evaluation and laying down of a set of goals (Benevides et al., 2017). Everything mentioned above will eventually lead up to those goals\nThe purpose of care plan goals\nThe first and most important reason to maintain a care plan is to have something which will act like a map leading to a child's healthy life. It will consist of everything that is needed to provide him\/her with a good life, from diagnosis to evaluation to an assessment of his strengths and weaknesses. Goals may be short term and related to the health and well being of the child. They might also be long term like securing a job. Categories of goals\nSince the condition of children with cerebral palsy is a complex one, simply organizing goals is crucial to make it a little easier to understand and comprehend. Managing of the initial disability\nCP is complex but the initial goal should be to manage the primary condition of the child. To achieve this objective the taking the assistance of a neurologist or paediatrician is very important. CP has several co-existing conditions like movement and coordination disorders, seizures, underdevelopment of cognitive skills. Laying down of goals to improve in these is the next crucial step. Problems in mobility are the most common issue that children with cerebral palsy face and most of them are unable to walk. Goals addressing improving mobility are important to make the child feel comfortable and confident. Pain is the component that comes hand in hand with Cerebral Palsy. Stiff muscles, spastic movement and inability to move causes pain to the child and setting goals to manage pain is extremely important to help him become more comfortable thereby helping in achieving other simultaneous goals. Working on communication\nA child diagnosed with cerebral Palsy not only has underdeveloped cognitive skills but also has tremendous difficulty in communicating as their vocal cords have been affected adversely due to their medical condition. If a child is struggling with speech and language, including this goal is important to achieve a greater ability to communicate through speech or other ways. A child suffering from cerebral palsy may have difficulties in making social interactions with people. He may have trouble in making conversation with his peers. But because this is an important aspect of life, it is important for the child to connect with others and for that reason the setting of this goal is important. Other goals that are also important are goals related to education, self-care, maximizing the good qualities of life and independence. The setting of goals is an important aspect of life for everybody but a child born with a disability, it is more important. To give a child a better chance at living a good life, taking off these goals seriously is very important.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:f1cbf3f9-606d-48b1-aff6-83dd89bbcefc>"]},{"passage":"Art can serve as a bridge for your child to express feelings, thoughts and more.

The individual's parents may no longer be living, or could be handling their own medical issues related to aging. Cerebral palsy support groups can be instrumental in assisting an adult living with the disease. Without support, it can be difficult for the person to navigate issues like employment, health care, insurance, and living arrangements. Group homes are an option for people who suffer from severe cerebral palsy, and require daily, hands-on assistance with self-care and feeding.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:f6923bb2-67b1-46fb-b7cc-826f5b10526b>"]}]}

Intervertebral discs are crucial components of the spine, providing cushioning and support between the vertebrae. They play a significant role in maintaining spinal stability and flexibility.\n\nThe effects of nicotine on intervertebral discs are not directly well-studied, but there are some indirect implications that can be inferred from research on the effects of nicotine on blood vessels and overall vascular health. Nicotine is known to cause vasoconstriction, which is the narrowing of blood vessels. This can lead to reduced blood flow to various tissues and organs, including the intervertebral discs. Since intervertebral discs rely on a constant supply of nutrients and oxygen delivered through the bloodstream, any disruption in blood flow could potentially impair their health.\n\nA study published in the journal Spine titled \"Smoking and Cervical Disc Degeneration\" (Leavitt et al., 2012) found that smoking is associated with increased cervical disc degeneration. The study suggests that nicotine may contribute to this degeneration by causing microvascular disease, which affects the small blood vessels that supply nutrients to the discs. This can lead to a decrease in the disc's ability to maintain its structure and function, potentially resulting in pain and disability.\n\nIn addition to its effects on blood vessels, nicotine can also have direct effects on the cells within the intervertebral disc. Studies have shown that nicotine can alter the metabolism and function of disc cells, potentially contributing to the degeneration of the disc over time.\n\nIt's important to note that while these findings suggest a link between nicotine consumption and intervertebral disc health, further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms involved and to determine the extent of the impact. Nonetheless, given the well-documented harmful effects of smoking on overall health, it is advisable to avoid nicotine consumption to maintain optimal health, including the health of the intervertebral discs.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: Differential effects of nicotine and tobacco smoke condensate on human annulus fibrosus cell metabolism. ABSTRACT Tobacco smoking increases the risk of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) and back pain, but the mechanisms underlying the adverse effects of smoking are largely unknown. Current hypotheses predict that smoking contributes to IDD indirectly through nicotine-mediated vasoconstriction which limits the exchange of nutrients between the discs and their surroundings. We alternatively hypothesize that direct contact of disc cells, that is, cells in the outermost annulus and those present along fissures in degenerating discs, with the vascular system containing soluble tobacco smoking constituents could perturb normal metabolic activities resulting in IDD. In this study, we tested our hypothesis by comparing the effects of direct exposure of human disc cells to tobacco smoke condensate and nicotine on cell viability and metabolic activity. We showed that smoke condensate, which contains all of the water-soluble compounds inhaled by smokers, exerts greater detrimental effects on human disc cell viability and metabolism than nicotine. Smoke condensate greatly induced an inflammatory response and gene expression of metalloproteinases while reduced active matrix synthesis and expression of matrix structural genes. Therefore, we have demonstrated that disc cell exposure to the constituents of tobacco smoke has negative consequences which have the potential to alter disc matrix homeostasis. - SourceAvailable from: PubMed Central[Show abstract] [Hide abstract]\nABSTRACT: The purpose of the present study was to simultaneously examine the transcript levels of a large number of interleukins (ILs; IL-9, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-16, IL-17, IL-18, IL-26, and IL-27) and investigate their correlation with the clinicopathological profiles of patients with tuberculous intervertebral discs.PLoS ONE 01\/2014; 9(6):e101324. · 3.53 Impact Factor\n- [Show abstract] [Hide abstract]\nABSTRACT: Cigarette smoking has deleterious effects on the musculo-skeletal system. The loss of bone mineral content and increased incidence of fractures are the best known negative consequences. The pathogenesis is complex, due to direct toxic effects on osteoblasts\/osteoclasts activity of nicotine, and indirect actions on sex and adrenocortical hormones, vitamin D, intestinal calcium absorption, vessels and oxygen supply. Smoking may favour the onset or aggravate the progression of rheumatoid arthritis and back pain. Negative influences have been observed on muscle and on tendons. Moreover, smoking habit is associated to a number of short term post-operative complications and higher resource consumption. Smoking cessation is highly advisable with positive effects on the bone metabolism on the long term. More positive and immediate results can be obtained in patients submitted to orthopedic surgery: the healing process is improved, the frequency of complications is reduced, and the length of hospital stay is shortened.Muscles, ligaments and tendons journal. 04\/2013; 3(2):63-9. - [Show abstract] [Hide abstract]\nABSTRACT: Abstract Intervertebral discs comprise the largest avascular cartilaginous organ in the body, and its nutrient condition can be impaired by degeneration, aging, and even metabolic disease. The unique microenvironment brings special stresses to various disc cell types, including nucleus pulposus cells, notochordal cells, annulus fibrosus cells, and endplate chondrocytes. These cells experience nutrient starvation, acidic stress, hypoxic stress, hyperglycemic stress, osmotic stress, and mechanical stress. Understanding the detailed responses and complex adaptive mechanisms of disc cells to various stresses might provide some clues to guide therapy for disc degeneration. By reviewing the published literatures describing disc cells under different hostile microenvironments, we conclude that these cells exhibit different responses to microenvironmental stresses with different mechanisms. Moreover, the interaction and combination of these stresses create a complex environment that synergistically increase or decrease influences on disc cells, compared with the effects of a single stress.\n\nWhen you talk to most people about serious health risks, it’s almost a guarantee that smoking will be brought up. After all, stopping smoking is one of the single most important things one can do to reduce their risk of cancer and heart disease and start to feel better physically as a whole. But at Joseph R. Giove Clinical Hypnosis, I’ve noticed that a number of people don’t fully understand just what it is about smoking that keeps them coming back or what damages their health. While things like the tar and the various carcinogens within a cigarette are understood, the various health effects of nicotine aren’t as widely talked about. This is especially problematic since many people switch from smoking cigarettes to using electronic cigarettes or even nicotine gum or patches. They’re still getting their nicotine, but through method that doesn’t come with the tar and the more than 4,000 toxic chemicals found in cigarette smoke. However, what they don’t realize is that nicotine itself has a variety of impacts on the human body and its overall health and wellbeing. In other words, using any kind of nicotine product is something you should stop doing. Otherwise you’ll be putting yourself at risk for a variety of health issues. What Is Nicotine? First, it’s worth understanding the basics of what nicotine itself actually is. There are a few basic points that can help explain this to you clearly. - Nicotine is a type of compound known as a parasympathomimetic alkaloid. - It’s found in the leaves of the nightshade family of plants and heavily in tobacco plants. - It makes up between 0.6 and 3% of the total dry weight of tobacco. In short, it’s a chemical compound found in plants. But beyond that, nicotine is a drug – just like the many illegal drugs available throughout the country. It acts as a stimulant, and also triggers various psychoactive effects on the user. This includes feelings of relaxation, appetite reduction, and mood elevation. It works as a stimulant and a relaxant and as such is a bit different from many other drugs out there. The Many Health Effects\nNow it’s time to get into the health effects of nicotine. When a cigarette is smoked, the nicotine is absorbed by the lungs and enters the blood, reaching the brain in about seven seconds in most cases. This triggers the release of a variety of different chemicals like dopamine and serotonin, which brings the calming effect with it. But that nicotine-rich blood is now moving throughout the body and can have a wide range of impacts on it. The various health effects of nicotine include the following. - A serious increase in blood pressure and heart rate, which can trigger angina and other heart related issues. This is especially true in patients already suffering from some form of heart related illness. - An increase in the chance of developing cardiovascular disease has been linked to nicotine use as well. This applies to nicotine no matter how it is used to enter the body, from patches to smoking and beyond. - Nicotine can trigger a variety of different gastrointestinal problems. This includes nausea, diarrhea, and peptic ulcers. - It also leads to dry mouth and heartburn. - Nicotine has been linked to headaches, dizziness, and abnormal sleeping patterns. - The impact of nicotine on the circulatory system is especially profound, and it has been linked to an increase in the chance of clots, an enlarged aorta, damaged vessels, and more. It’s true that currently there are only mild links between cancer and nicotine itself, though researchers disagree as to whether or not the use of nicotine will lead to cancer. Some studies have shown that it can occur, and that tumor growth is increased directly by nicotine. In other words, the risk of cancer from nicotine is something worth paying attention to – just because you’re not smoking doesn’t mean you’re not placing yourself at an added risk. Pregnant Women, Fetuses, And Nicotine\nPregnant women in particular need to avoid the use of nicotine. No matter how the chemical enters the body, it will find its way into the bloodstream and will then be passed to the unborn child.\n\n(RxWiki News) It’s a well-known fact — cigarettes are bad for your health. Just how far the negative health effects of cigarettes reach, however, may come as a surprise to many. A new study from Emory University has linked smoking cigarettes with degenerative disc disease in the cervical spine, a condition which can cause chronic neck pain. The cervical spine is located in the neck and is comprised of vertebrae, as well as cervical discs, which sit between the vertebrae and absorb shock to the spine. As people get older, these discs dehydrate and shrink, which can cause chronic pain to develop. \"Smoking is not healthy for a person’s intervertebral discs given the risk of developing microvascular disease — a disease of the small blood vessels — due to nicotine abuse,\" said lead investigator Mitchel Leavitt, MD, in a press release.

Nicotine can damage these blood vessels, causing the discs to receive improper nourishment and degenerate faster. Although past research has linked smoking to disc degeneration in the lumbar spine (near the base of the spine), none have linked smoking with degeneration in the cervical spine. This study looked at the CT scans of 182 patients who were scanned for various reasons, more than half of whom were women and 34 percent of whom were smokers. Researchers asked a radiologist with training in neuroradiology and a physiatrist to review these scans. Each disc was rated on a scale between 0 and 3 (as normal, mild, moderate or severe) depending on how much it had degenerated. A cumulative score between 0 and 15 was then given for the entire cervical spine. Dr. Leavitt and team also looked at how often patients smoked and for how long, and then adjusted for health factors such as age, body mass index, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.

Research presented at conferences may not have been peer-reviewed. Information on funding sources and conflicts of interest was not available at the time of publication.\n\nIn recent decades, the percentage of flue-cured tobacco in cigarette blends has decreased.64 Since flue-cured tobacco is slightly acidic and air- and sun-cured tobaccos are neutral to slightly alkaline, the industry has moved to a type of cigarette that produces a greater dose of free nicotine in its smoke. PHARMACOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF NICOTINE\nReduction in muscle tone\nIncrease in attentiveness\nReduction in appetite\nIncrease in heart rate\nIncrease in blood pressure\nReduction in urine production\nTypical tobacco leaves contain between 0.5 and 3 percent nicotine by weight, a figure that varies substantially depending on variety of plant, location on the plant, growing and harvest conditions, and curing technique.65 The tobacco in a single cigarette contains, depending on the manufacture, approximately 10 milligrams of nicotine.66 Less than 10 percent of the nicotine in a cigarette is inhaled and enters the bloodstream via the lungs, mouth, or stomach. The remainder is exhaled without absorption, destroyed by burning, or lost to uninhaled smoke. MECHANISM OF ACTION\nNicotine exerts its effects by binding as an agonist to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central and peripheral nervous system. In the periphery, nicotine gives rise to increased activity of the gastrointestinal tract and elevated blood pressure and heart rate, in part via the release of epinephrine from the adrenal glands. In the brain, nicotinic receptors are located at the presynaptic terminals of dopaminergic, cholinergic, and glutamatergic neurons. Binding of nicotine causes the release of those neurotransmitters, which accounts for diverse effects on elevating mood and producing euphoria. Nicotine also reduces skeletal muscle tone, contributing to a sense of relaxation. Connections to the opioid and cannabinoid neurotransmitter systems, not yet fully investigated, may underlie some of the pleasure and analgesia resulting from tobacco use. Nicotine decreases appetite and increases psychomotor ability, attention, and memory consolidation. Nicotine is a demonstrated antidepressant, and co-occurrence of nicotine use and depression is an indication that people might self-medicate to reduce depressive symptoms.67\nIn addition to nicotine, which contributes to cardiovascular disease through an increased workload on the heart and blood vessels, tobacco, especially when smoked, contains numerous processing and combustion byproducts that cause cancer.68 (Nicotine itself is toxic but not carcinogenic.) As awareness of the risks of consuming tobacco has grown in recent years, companies whose fortunes have long depended on the sale of nicotine products have diversified to include the production and marketing of nicotine delivery by other means, including aerosol, lozenge, and “dissolvable tobacco.”69 Indeed, many of the electronic cigarettes (generating doses of vaporized nicotine), nicotine patches, and nicotine chewing gums for smoking cessation are produced by “Big Tobacco.”\nWhen Europeans learned of the tobacco plant from American Indians, they tried to put its combined stimulating and relaxing properties into a medical and social context. Some thought that consumption of the plant was a dignified expression of high class; others found the practice unsavory. Some viewed tobacco as a healthful herb; others saw it as a dangerous poison. In modern times, countries are pulled between the economic value of the tobacco crop and the obligation to protect people from its risks. Such has been the history of this divisive and important psychoactive plant, whose nicotine-laden leaves have gripped so many.\n\nWhat Is Nicotine? Nicotine is a chemical compound found naturally in tobacco. When consumed it can cause chemical alterations to the brain and body. It can create an immediate invigorating, euphoric, relaxing sensation which can be found to be immediately pleasurable. Absorbing nicotine will induce the body to release adrenalin, which then causes the heart rate and blood pressure to rise. In this respect, nicotine has a similar stimulant effect to caffeine: blood vessels are restricted, causing blood pressure to rise, which in turn instigates the release of insulin. This is why smokers often experience a decreased appetite after a cigarette. Consumption of nicotine is also known to create an increased feeling of alertness and some believe it assists their concentration. Nicotine signals the brain to release dopamine (a pleasure associated chemical that is released when a person is satisfied). Increase levels of dopamine will make you feel relaxed, which will then tell the brain to release endorphins and glutamate. People therefore may begin smoking because they initially enjoy the stimulating effect of nicotine. Over time, the brain becomes more reliant on nicotine and stops producing acetylcholine. This can cause a dependency on nicotine, where the consumer needs nicotine in order to maintain their regular brain function. Thus, when nicotine levels drop, the person may experience disagreeable withdrawal symptoms. Nicotine is often consumed in tobacco cigarettes. The nicotine enters into the lungs, and then enters the bloodstream through the mucous membranes in the lungs and mouth. Within 20 seconds of inhalation the nicotine can reach the brain and be transported throughout the rest of the body. When a person smokes, hundreds of chemicals and toxins enter the blood along with the nicotine. The toxins increase the chances of heart attacks and strokes caused by blood clots. Carbon monoxide from the smoke puts a strain on the heart, making it overwork. Smoking also causes over 80% of deaths from lung cancer. Electronic cigarettes can contain nicotine and deliver it to the lungs without the need to burn and ingest tar and the harmful chemicals present in cigarettes. This means that the negative effect on the rest of the body is dramatically reduced when compared to smoking traditional cigarettes. For this reason, e-cigarettes are widely accepted as a less harmful alternative to smoking.

During 16th century, he planted the plant in Paris and promoted it. This alkaloid is almost 3% of tobacco’s dry weight and it mostly contains leaves and roots. But smaller amount of it found in other plants like potatoes, tomatoes, eggplants, leaves of coca plants and green peppers. Did you know that in the late 17th century, nicotine was used as pesticides? Yes, it is true! The antihervivore effect of nicotine can be very lethal, especially to insects. Likewise, Nicotine sulfate was also considered to be the most potent botanical insecticide that was available for home gardeners as it was very harmful to humans and was quickly absorbed through the skin. That is why, in 2008, the United States of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) banned the use of nicotine-based pesticides. Effects About tobacco Consumption\nIn higher doses, between 30 to 60 mg, nicotine can be very lethal to humans and deterrent to insects, making it neurotoxic chemical. However, in smaller doses, 1mg or smaller present in cigarette, it acts as a stimulant. In smaller doses, nicotine will not affect the health of the human beings. But in higher doses, it is very harmful to the health of the human beings. There are many side effects due to the tobacco consumption. - Affects nervous system\nNicotine mostly affects your nervous system and helps reduce your appetite, relieves depression, boosts mood, improves memory and cognition, and enhances train activity. However, it also increases salivation, stimulates intestinal motility, increases both the blood pressure and heart rate, and may even cause vomiting and nausea. - Nicotine Addiction\nAlthough it takes only 1mg of nicotine in one cigarette to stimulate your brain, however, this single stick would be sufficient enough to cause you addiction to it too. Your brain is responsible in creating neurotransmitters, which thus creates emotions and sensations you feel within you. But when you inhale nicotine, it masks those neurotransmitters, thus deceiving neurons and replacing the substance called acetylcholine on its receptors. The nicotine then goes on to produce an abnormal amount of dopamine, causing euphoria. After smoking, the euphoria ceases because the nicotine effect has gone. Thus, when this feel-good sensation is gone, you might be attempted to have that feeling again. That is why, most people need another cigarette to revive that euphoria. This cycle continues, and then eventually, the addiction increases. - Chronic Withdrawal Symptoms\nSometimes, smokers may also want to quit smoking, and while doing so, they may experience mild to chronic withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, intense craving for nicotine, depression, trouble sleeping, drowsiness, headaches, frustration, inability to concentrate, and weight loss. These symptoms will be at its highest for at least 2-3 days after you’ve stopped smoking. The withdrawal symptoms may be even more frequent among people who used to smoke more sticks per day or who had longer years or smoking. But nicotine addicts are trying to avoid these same symptoms, and thus, they prolong their recovery and addiction to nicotine. There are number of diagnostics available today to detect nicotine in your body. When you inhale smoke, nicotine is metabolized into cotinine in vital organs such as the liver and lungs, which then is eventually expelled through the urine. Apart from nicotine, cotinine is a good indicator for nicotine use, detectable in saliva, urine, and the blood. - Length Of Time Nicotine Stay In The Bod\nIt depends on the number of tobacco you smoke every day, and the number of years you’ve smoked till today, and also the type of nicotine test done. In short, it may be 2 days, or it may stay as long as 3 months. - Nicotine Blood Test\nTo detect nicotine use, both quantitative and qualitative blood tests can be used. The presence, or the absence, or the blood nicotine levels can be figured out.\n\nWithin each system, certain categories of health related-effects were dominant, such as throat problems and headache. As more individuals adopt e-cigarettes and use them for longer periods of time, additional positive and negative effects on human health will likely be reported. This study is a step in understanding these issues; however, it will be many years before the long-term health consequences of e-cigarette use are known.

To the extent that of all the deaths of any kind in the US, 1 in 5 are a result of tobacco in some form. The effects of cigarette smoking are complex, long lasting and systemic. In addition to positioning you in some circles as a social outcast, being forced to step in to whatever weather conditions exist to feed the habit; cigarette smokers are now restricted in restaurants, hotels and businesses. The concerns about second hand smoke have made cigarette users unable to smoke in public areas, sporting events and entertainment centers. Cigarette smoke effects nearly ever area of the body eventually. Respiratory issues are among the first to develop. The American Cancer Society reported in 2008 that smoking lowers the oxygen level in the body. The lack of oxygen can reduce energy levels. The lungs have tiny air sacs, which are damaged as soon as the smoke from cigarette tobacco hits them. Over time cigarette tobacco can lead to emphysema, cancer, pneumonia or bronchitis and even tuberculosis, as the effects of smoking tobacco ravages and ultimately destroy your lungs. Over time cigarette tobacco also impacts the circulatory system, drastically increasing your risk for stroke and heart attack. The cilia and blood vessels in the circulatory that aid in moving the blood through the body can be damaged. The heart beats faster, blood pressure rises. The risk for heart disease increases. The heart rate increases, the lining of the blood vessels can be affected, which may allow fat deposits to cling to the walls of the blood vessels, increasing arteriosclerosis or artery hardening. The restriction of circulation in the body can lead to painful neuropathy. This may lead to gangrene and could result in amputation of affected areas. The slowed blood flow can reduce the body’s ability to fight infections. Blood can be thickened and this can further reduce the oxygen flowing to various parts of the body. All of this adds up to taxing the heart, increasing the potential for heart related fatalities. The reproductive system is affected as well. The American Council on Science and Health reported in 1996 study the men’s risk of erectile dysfunction is twice as high in smokers. Mobility and quantity of sperm levels are affected by smoking as well. Breast and cervical cancer are increased risked for women who smoke cigarette tobacco. Women who are pregnant can lower birth weight, increase the likelihood of premature or stillborn babies, or having a miscarriage. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome is more common in babies of smoking parents. Tar and nicotine can be passed through breast milk to nursing infants. The digestive system is affected by cigarette tobacco as well. Intestines and stomach inflammation or ulcers can result from smoking cigarette tobacco. Skin quality is also affected with more wrinkles, decreasing elasticity and poor circulation. Bad breath, yellow or stained teeth and the lingering smell of cigarette tobacco can follow smokers as well. Smoking takes the lives of millions of cigarette users every year and hundreds of thousands of those impacted by second hand smoke. The risks are clear, systemic and pervasive. There is a clear correlation between cigarette tobacco use and poor health. Tobacco and health are clearly linked with serious and fatal complications likely. Death and destruction appear to be the inevitable consequences of smoking, living with a smoker and users of cigarette tobacco. The advice from most medical professionals is if you don’t smoke don’t start. If you do smoke, stop. Work with your medical professional for an integrated program that will allow you to be more successful in breaking the negative effects of tobacco and your health. One alternative which reduces the effects of exposure to the carcinogenic properties of cigarettes is what is known as the smokeless cigarette or electric cigarette. The device uses a nicotine vapor that is injected when the user inhales, and the user is not exposed to the side effects of combustion whatsoever. A wide variety of accessories and options can be found with today's electronic cigarettes to suit most consumers.\n\nFor example, dizziness could have a major impact on a user’s life style if it were serious enough to prevent driving or working, as was reported to us by an e-cigarette user. Users need to be aware that e-cigarettes are not free of health consequences and that numerous negative effects have been reported. For individuals who do not smoke conventional cigarettes and who do not currently use e-cigarettes, knowledge of these health effects may be important in helping them decide if they wish to begin e-cigarette use. Many e-cigarette users reported multiple positive or negative symptoms that often affected more than one system, as shown inand . The negative interactome for the Electronic Cigarette Forum demonstrated that when multiple systems are affected in individual e-cigarette users, there is often interaction between systems, such as respiratory and chest, respiratory and mouth\/throat, and digestive and neurological. This information may be useful to physicians treating patients who are using e-cigarettes and\/or have a prior history of smoking. The data may also be used to help diagnose health problems in patients for whom smoking\/e-cigarette history is not known. Although the positive interactome for the Electronic Cigarette Forum had fewer users, interactions between systems were similar to those observed in the negative interactome. In the negative Electronic Cigarette Forum interactome, many symptoms involved the neurological and sensory systems, and these may have been caused by an overdose or withdrawal of nicotine, which activates nicotinic cholinergic receptors in the brain . Some symptoms reported by e-cigarette users, such as vomiting, nausea, changes in heart rhythm, confusion, dizziness, and fatigue, would be consistent with a nicotine overdose [ ]. Because nicotine can be added to cartomizers\/cartridges, the potential to overdose exists. It is also possible that some reported symptoms, such as anxiety and depression, which are characteristic of nicotine withdrawal [ ], were caused by insufficient delivery of nicotine to some e-cigarette users. As previously shown, inexperienced users of e-cigarettes may not receive adequate levels of nicotine [ ]. While our study demonstrates the value of an infodemiological approach, it has several limitations. The online forums may be biased toward negative reporting, and the positive effects are probably under-reported in our analysis. In the current study, users posted effects that they observed after starting e-cigarette use and that they therefore attribute the effects to e-cigarettes. However, these results do not take into account past smoking and lifestyle history, pre-existing conditions, or other medical problems the users may have had before e-cigarette use began, any of which may have affected or even aggravated their response to e-cigarette aerosol. In addition, user posts cannot be validated, and it is possible that inaccurate information appears in the forums. Future work should be undertaken using methods that would acquire additional medical and lifestyle history of each user and that draw participants from a random sample of e-cigarette users. Additionally, our data do not address the effects that e-cigarette use may have on prenatal development, a period in the human life cycle that is particularly sensitive to environmental chemicals [, ]. Our recent study found that some e-cigarette refill fluids were highly toxic to human embryonic stem cells [ ], indicating the need for further work in this area. Our data will be helpful to e-cigarette users who may experience similar effects, to health care professionals advising individuals on e-cigarette usage, and to policy makers and legislators who regulate sales, use, and marketing of e-cigarettes. Interactome data may help health care workers identify problems caused by e-cigarette use, eg, problems with the respiratory system are often linked to problems with the neurological system. While it can be argued that e-cigarettes are safer than conventional tobacco-burning products, the data in this study demonstrate that e-cigarette users are not free of negative health effects. This study provides a preliminary synopsis of the short-term health effects related to e-cigarette use as reported in online forums. Effects occurred most often in the respiratory and neurological systems and in the mouth and throat with a total of 12 systems being affected.\n\nIn the mid-twentieth century smoking in the United States was often associated with romance, relaxation, and adventure; movie stars oozed glamour on screen while smoking, and movie tough guys were never more masculine than when lighting up. Songs such as \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\" topped the hit parade. Smoking became a rite of passage for many young males and a sign of increasing independence for women. Since the 1990s, however, there has been an increase of opposition to tobacco use. Health authorities warn of the dangers of smoking and chewing tobacco, and nonsmokers object to secondhand smoke—because of both the smell and the health dangers of breathing smoke from other people's cigarettes. Today, a smoker is more likely to ask for permission before lighting up, and the answer is often \"no.\" Because of health concerns, smoking has been banned on airplanes, in hospitals, and in many workplaces, restaurants, and bars. PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF NICOTINE\nTobacco is a plant native to the Western Hemisphere. It contains nicotine, a drug classified as a stimulant, although it has some depressive effects as well. Nicotine is a poisonous alkaloid that is the major psychoactive (mood-altering) ingredient in tobacco. (Alkaloids are carbon- and nitrogen-containing compounds that are found in some families of plants. They have both poisonous and medicinal properties.) Nicotine's effects on the body are complex. The drug affects the brain and central nervous system as well as the hypothalamus and pituitary glands of the endocrine (hormone) system. Nicotine easily crosses the blood-brain barrier (a series of capillaries and cells that controls the flow of substances from the blood to the brain), and it accumulates in the brain—faster than caffeine or heroin, but slower than diazepam (a sedative medicine used to treat anxiety). In the brain nicotine imitates the actions of the hormone epinephrine (adrenaline) and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, both of which heighten awareness. Nicotine also triggers the release of dopamine, which enhances feelings of pleasure, and endorphins, \"the brain's natural opiates,\" which have a calming effect. As noted earlier, nicotine acts as both a stimulant and a depressant. By stimulating certain nerve cells in the spinal cord, nicotine relaxes the nerves and slows some reactions, such as the knee-jerk reflex. Small amounts of nicotine stimulate some nerve cells, but these cells are depressed by large amounts. In addition, nicotine stimulates the brain cortex (the outer layer of the brain) and affects the functions of the heart and lungs. TRENDS IN TOBACCO USE\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the consumption of cigarettes, the most widely used tobacco product, has decreased over the past generation among adults. After increasing rather consistently for sixty years, the per capita (per person) consumption of cigarettes peaked in the 1960s at well over four thousand cigarettes per year (\"Chronic Disease Notes and Reports,\" Fall 2001, http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nccdphp\/publications\/cdnr\/pdf\/CDNRfall2001.pdf). The steady decline in smoking came shortly after 1964, when the Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service (January 1964, http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/Tobacco\/sgr\/sgr_1964\/sgr64.htm) concluded that cigarette smoking is a cause of lung and laryngeal cancer in men, a probable cause of lung cancer in women, and the most important cause of chronic bronchitis in both genders. By 2006 the annual per capita consumption of cigarettes for those aged eighteen and over was 1,691. (See Table 3.1.)\n\n### Question: How does nicotine consumption affect the health of intervertebral discs in the human body?","passages":[{"passage":"Differential effects of nicotine and tobacco smoke condensate on human annulus fibrosus cell metabolism. ABSTRACT Tobacco smoking increases the risk of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) and back pain, but the mechanisms underlying the adverse effects of smoking are largely unknown. Current hypotheses predict that smoking contributes to IDD indirectly through nicotine-mediated vasoconstriction which limits the exchange of nutrients between the discs and their surroundings. We alternatively hypothesize that direct contact of disc cells, that is, cells in the outermost annulus and those present along fissures in degenerating discs, with the vascular system containing soluble tobacco smoking constituents could perturb normal metabolic activities resulting in IDD. In this study, we tested our hypothesis by comparing the effects of direct exposure of human disc cells to tobacco smoke condensate and nicotine on cell viability and metabolic activity. We showed that smoke condensate, which contains all of the water-soluble compounds inhaled by smokers, exerts greater detrimental effects on human disc cell viability and metabolism than nicotine. Smoke condensate greatly induced an inflammatory response and gene expression of metalloproteinases while reduced active matrix synthesis and expression of matrix structural genes. Therefore, we have demonstrated that disc cell exposure to the constituents of tobacco smoke has negative consequences which have the potential to alter disc matrix homeostasis. - SourceAvailable from: PubMed Central[Show abstract] [Hide abstract]\nABSTRACT: The purpose of the present study was to simultaneously examine the transcript levels of a large number of interleukins (ILs; IL-9, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-16, IL-17, IL-18, IL-26, and IL-27) and investigate their correlation with the clinicopathological profiles of patients with tuberculous intervertebral discs.PLoS ONE 01\/2014; 9(6):e101324. · 3.53 Impact Factor\n- [Show abstract] [Hide abstract]\nABSTRACT: Cigarette smoking has deleterious effects on the musculo-skeletal system. The loss of bone mineral content and increased incidence of fractures are the best known negative consequences. The pathogenesis is complex, due to direct toxic effects on osteoblasts\/osteoclasts activity of nicotine, and indirect actions on sex and adrenocortical hormones, vitamin D, intestinal calcium absorption, vessels and oxygen supply. Smoking may favour the onset or aggravate the progression of rheumatoid arthritis and back pain. Negative influences have been observed on muscle and on tendons. Moreover, smoking habit is associated to a number of short term post-operative complications and higher resource consumption. Smoking cessation is highly advisable with positive effects on the bone metabolism on the long term. More positive and immediate results can be obtained in patients submitted to orthopedic surgery: the healing process is improved, the frequency of complications is reduced, and the length of hospital stay is shortened.Muscles, ligaments and tendons journal. 04\/2013; 3(2):63-9. - [Show abstract] [Hide abstract]\nABSTRACT: Abstract Intervertebral discs comprise the largest avascular cartilaginous organ in the body, and its nutrient condition can be impaired by degeneration, aging, and even metabolic disease. The unique microenvironment brings special stresses to various disc cell types, including nucleus pulposus cells, notochordal cells, annulus fibrosus cells, and endplate chondrocytes. These cells experience nutrient starvation, acidic stress, hypoxic stress, hyperglycemic stress, osmotic stress, and mechanical stress. Understanding the detailed responses and complex adaptive mechanisms of disc cells to various stresses might provide some clues to guide therapy for disc degeneration. By reviewing the published literatures describing disc cells under different hostile microenvironments, we conclude that these cells exhibit different responses to microenvironmental stresses with different mechanisms. Moreover, the interaction and combination of these stresses create a complex environment that synergistically increase or decrease influences on disc cells, compared with the effects of a single stress.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:bafe38fc-6bf3-468e-94be-7ebd726b62ad>"]},{"passage":"When you talk to most people about serious health risks, it’s almost a guarantee that smoking will be brought up. After all, stopping smoking is one of the single most important things one can do to reduce their risk of cancer and heart disease and start to feel better physically as a whole. But at Joseph R. Giove Clinical Hypnosis, I’ve noticed that a number of people don’t fully understand just what it is about smoking that keeps them coming back or what damages their health. While things like the tar and the various carcinogens within a cigarette are understood, the various health effects of nicotine aren’t as widely talked about. This is especially problematic since many people switch from smoking cigarettes to using electronic cigarettes or even nicotine gum or patches. They’re still getting their nicotine, but through method that doesn’t come with the tar and the more than 4,000 toxic chemicals found in cigarette smoke. However, what they don’t realize is that nicotine itself has a variety of impacts on the human body and its overall health and wellbeing. In other words, using any kind of nicotine product is something you should stop doing. Otherwise you’ll be putting yourself at risk for a variety of health issues. What Is Nicotine? First, it’s worth understanding the basics of what nicotine itself actually is. There are a few basic points that can help explain this to you clearly. - Nicotine is a type of compound known as a parasympathomimetic alkaloid. - It’s found in the leaves of the nightshade family of plants and heavily in tobacco plants. - It makes up between 0.6 and 3% of the total dry weight of tobacco. In short, it’s a chemical compound found in plants. But beyond that, nicotine is a drug – just like the many illegal drugs available throughout the country. It acts as a stimulant, and also triggers various psychoactive effects on the user. This includes feelings of relaxation, appetite reduction, and mood elevation. It works as a stimulant and a relaxant and as such is a bit different from many other drugs out there. The Many Health Effects\nNow it’s time to get into the health effects of nicotine. When a cigarette is smoked, the nicotine is absorbed by the lungs and enters the blood, reaching the brain in about seven seconds in most cases. This triggers the release of a variety of different chemicals like dopamine and serotonin, which brings the calming effect with it. But that nicotine-rich blood is now moving throughout the body and can have a wide range of impacts on it. The various health effects of nicotine include the following. - A serious increase in blood pressure and heart rate, which can trigger angina and other heart related issues. This is especially true in patients already suffering from some form of heart related illness. - An increase in the chance of developing cardiovascular disease has been linked to nicotine use as well. This applies to nicotine no matter how it is used to enter the body, from patches to smoking and beyond. - Nicotine can trigger a variety of different gastrointestinal problems. This includes nausea, diarrhea, and peptic ulcers. - It also leads to dry mouth and heartburn. - Nicotine has been linked to headaches, dizziness, and abnormal sleeping patterns. - The impact of nicotine on the circulatory system is especially profound, and it has been linked to an increase in the chance of clots, an enlarged aorta, damaged vessels, and more. It’s true that currently there are only mild links between cancer and nicotine itself, though researchers disagree as to whether or not the use of nicotine will lead to cancer. Some studies have shown that it can occur, and that tumor growth is increased directly by nicotine. In other words, the risk of cancer from nicotine is something worth paying attention to – just because you’re not smoking doesn’t mean you’re not placing yourself at an added risk. Pregnant Women, Fetuses, And Nicotine\nPregnant women in particular need to avoid the use of nicotine. No matter how the chemical enters the body, it will find its way into the bloodstream and will then be passed to the unborn child.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:3333a0ac-7f61-4293-b595-b8ad37fe5a5d>"]},{"passage":"(RxWiki News) It’s a well-known fact — cigarettes are bad for your health. Just how far the negative health effects of cigarettes reach, however, may come as a surprise to many. A new study from Emory University has linked smoking cigarettes with degenerative disc disease in the cervical spine, a condition which can cause chronic neck pain. The cervical spine is located in the neck and is comprised of vertebrae, as well as cervical discs, which sit between the vertebrae and absorb shock to the spine. As people get older, these discs dehydrate and shrink, which can cause chronic pain to develop. \"Smoking is not healthy for a person’s intervertebral discs given the risk of developing microvascular disease — a disease of the small blood vessels — due to nicotine abuse,\" said lead investigator Mitchel Leavitt, MD, in a press release. Dr. Leavitt is a resident doctor in Emory’s Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. Intervertebral discs get their nourishment from the microvasculature system, a small system of blood vessels that line either side of the discs. Nicotine can damage these blood vessels, causing the discs to receive improper nourishment and degenerate faster. Although past research has linked smoking to disc degeneration in the lumbar spine (near the base of the spine), none have linked smoking with degeneration in the cervical spine. This study looked at the CT scans of 182 patients who were scanned for various reasons, more than half of whom were women and 34 percent of whom were smokers. Researchers asked a radiologist with training in neuroradiology and a physiatrist to review these scans. Each disc was rated on a scale between 0 and 3 (as normal, mild, moderate or severe) depending on how much it had degenerated. A cumulative score between 0 and 15 was then given for the entire cervical spine. Dr. Leavitt and team also looked at how often patients smoked and for how long, and then adjusted for health factors such as age, body mass index, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. On average, current smokers were more likely to have cervical degenerative disc disease. Age made the disease worse, but coexisting conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high BMI did not. \"This is another example of the detrimental effects of smoking,\" Dr. Leavitt said. \"Pain and spine clinics are filled with patients who suffer chronic neck and back pain, and this study provides the physician with more ammunition to use when educating them about their need to quit smoking.\" The study was presented Feb. 18 at the Association of Academic Physiatrists' Annual Meeting in Sacramento, CA.

PHARMACOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF NICOTINE\nReduction in muscle tone\nIncrease in attentiveness\nReduction in appetite\nIncrease in heart rate\nIncrease in blood pressure\nReduction in urine production\nTypical tobacco leaves contain between 0.5 and 3 percent nicotine by weight, a figure that varies substantially depending on variety of plant, location on the plant, growing and harvest conditions, and curing technique.65 The tobacco in a single cigarette contains, depending on the manufacture, approximately 10 milligrams of nicotine.66 Less than 10 percent of the nicotine in a cigarette is inhaled and enters the bloodstream via the lungs, mouth, or stomach. The remainder is exhaled without absorption, destroyed by burning, or lost to uninhaled smoke. MECHANISM OF ACTION\nNicotine exerts its effects by binding as an agonist to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central and peripheral nervous system. In the periphery, nicotine gives rise to increased activity of the gastrointestinal tract and elevated blood pressure and heart rate, in part via the release of epinephrine from the adrenal glands. In the brain, nicotinic receptors are located at the presynaptic terminals of dopaminergic, cholinergic, and glutamatergic neurons. Binding of nicotine causes the release of those neurotransmitters, which accounts for diverse effects on elevating mood and producing euphoria. Nicotine also reduces skeletal muscle tone, contributing to a sense of relaxation. Connections to the opioid and cannabinoid neurotransmitter systems, not yet fully investigated, may underlie some of the pleasure and analgesia resulting from tobacco use. Nicotine decreases appetite and increases psychomotor ability, attention, and memory consolidation. Nicotine is a demonstrated antidepressant, and co-occurrence of nicotine use and depression is an indication that people might self-medicate to reduce depressive symptoms.67\nIn addition to nicotine, which contributes to cardiovascular disease through an increased workload on the heart and blood vessels, tobacco, especially when smoked, contains numerous processing and combustion byproducts that cause cancer.68 (Nicotine itself is toxic but not carcinogenic.) As awareness of the risks of consuming tobacco has grown in recent years, companies whose fortunes have long depended on the sale of nicotine products have diversified to include the production and marketing of nicotine delivery by other means, including aerosol, lozenge, and “dissolvable tobacco.”69 Indeed, many of the electronic cigarettes (generating doses of vaporized nicotine), nicotine patches, and nicotine chewing gums for smoking cessation are produced by “Big Tobacco.”\nWhen Europeans learned of the tobacco plant from American Indians, they tried to put its combined stimulating and relaxing properties into a medical and social context. Some thought that consumption of the plant was a dignified expression of high class; others found the practice unsavory. Some viewed tobacco as a healthful herb; others saw it as a dangerous poison. In modern times, countries are pulled between the economic value of the tobacco crop and the obligation to protect people from its risks. Such has been the history of this divisive and important psychoactive plant, whose nicotine-laden leaves have gripped so many.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:900fbd15-d091-4be8-b9e8-8c4821aef116>"]},{"passage":"What Is Nicotine? Nicotine is a chemical compound found naturally in tobacco. When consumed it can cause chemical alterations to the brain and body. It can create an immediate invigorating, euphoric, relaxing sensation which can be found to be immediately pleasurable. Absorbing nicotine will induce the body to release adrenalin, which then causes the heart rate and blood pressure to rise. In this respect, nicotine has a similar stimulant effect to caffeine: blood vessels are restricted, causing blood pressure to rise, which in turn instigates the release of insulin. This is why smokers often experience a decreased appetite after a cigarette. Consumption of nicotine is also known to create an increased feeling of alertness and some believe it assists their concentration. Nicotine signals the brain to release dopamine (a pleasure associated chemical that is released when a person is satisfied). Increase levels of dopamine will make you feel relaxed, which will then tell the brain to release endorphins and glutamate. People therefore may begin smoking because they initially enjoy the stimulating effect of nicotine. Over time, the brain becomes more reliant on nicotine and stops producing acetylcholine. This can cause a dependency on nicotine, where the consumer needs nicotine in order to maintain their regular brain function. Thus, when nicotine levels drop, the person may experience disagreeable withdrawal symptoms. Nicotine is often consumed in tobacco cigarettes. The nicotine enters into the lungs, and then enters the bloodstream through the mucous membranes in the lungs and mouth. Within 20 seconds of inhalation the nicotine can reach the brain and be transported throughout the rest of the body. When a person smokes, hundreds of chemicals and toxins enter the blood along with the nicotine. The toxins increase the chances of heart attacks and strokes caused by blood clots. Carbon monoxide from the smoke puts a strain on the heart, making it overwork. Smoking also causes over 80% of deaths from lung cancer. Electronic cigarettes can contain nicotine and deliver it to the lungs without the need to burn and ingest tar and the harmful chemicals present in cigarettes. This means that the negative effect on the rest of the body is dramatically reduced when compared to smoking traditional cigarettes. For this reason, e-cigarettes are widely accepted as a less harmful alternative to smoking.

During 16th century, he planted the plant in Paris and promoted it. This alkaloid is almost 3% of tobacco’s dry weight and it mostly contains leaves and roots. But smaller amount of it found in other plants like potatoes, tomatoes, eggplants, leaves of coca plants and green peppers. Did you know that in the late 17th century, nicotine was used as pesticides? Yes, it is true! The antihervivore effect of nicotine can be very lethal, especially to insects. Likewise, Nicotine sulfate was also considered to be the most potent botanical insecticide that was available for home gardeners as it was very harmful to humans and was quickly absorbed through the skin. That is why, in 2008, the United States of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) banned the use of nicotine-based pesticides. Effects About tobacco Consumption\nIn higher doses, between 30 to 60 mg, nicotine can be very lethal to humans and deterrent to insects, making it neurotoxic chemical. However, in smaller doses, 1mg or smaller present in cigarette, it acts as a stimulant. In smaller doses, nicotine will not affect the health of the human beings. But in higher doses, it is very harmful to the health of the human beings. There are many side effects due to the tobacco consumption. - Affects nervous system\nNicotine mostly affects your nervous system and helps reduce your appetite, relieves depression, boosts mood, improves memory and cognition, and enhances train activity. However, it also increases salivation, stimulates intestinal motility, increases both the blood pressure and heart rate, and may even cause vomiting and nausea. - Nicotine Addiction\nAlthough it takes only 1mg of nicotine in one cigarette to stimulate your brain, however, this single stick would be sufficient enough to cause you addiction to it too. Your brain is responsible in creating neurotransmitters, which thus creates emotions and sensations you feel within you. But when you inhale nicotine, it masks those neurotransmitters, thus deceiving neurons and replacing the substance called acetylcholine on its receptors. The nicotine then goes on to produce an abnormal amount of dopamine, causing euphoria. After smoking, the euphoria ceases because the nicotine effect has gone. Thus, when this feel-good sensation is gone, you might be attempted to have that feeling again. That is why, most people need another cigarette to revive that euphoria. This cycle continues, and then eventually, the addiction increases. - Chronic Withdrawal Symptoms\nSometimes, smokers may also want to quit smoking, and while doing so, they may experience mild to chronic withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, intense craving for nicotine, depression, trouble sleeping, drowsiness, headaches, frustration, inability to concentrate, and weight loss. These symptoms will be at its highest for at least 2-3 days after you’ve stopped smoking. The withdrawal symptoms may be even more frequent among people who used to smoke more sticks per day or who had longer years or smoking. But nicotine addicts are trying to avoid these same symptoms, and thus, they prolong their recovery and addiction to nicotine. There are number of diagnostics available today to detect nicotine in your body. When you inhale smoke, nicotine is metabolized into cotinine in vital organs such as the liver and lungs, which then is eventually expelled through the urine. Apart from nicotine, cotinine is a good indicator for nicotine use, detectable in saliva, urine, and the blood. - Length Of Time Nicotine Stay In The Bod\nIt depends on the number of tobacco you smoke every day, and the number of years you’ve smoked till today, and also the type of nicotine test done. In short, it may be 2 days, or it may stay as long as 3 months. - Nicotine Blood Test\nTo detect nicotine use, both quantitative and qualitative blood tests can be used. The presence, or the absence, or the blood nicotine levels can be figured out.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:5d90f364-0e12-4570-af17-d6e8974bc88f>"]},{"passage":"Within each system, certain categories of health related-effects were dominant, such as throat problems and headache.

To the extent that of all the deaths of any kind in the US, 1 in 5 are a result of tobacco in some form. The effects of cigarette smoking are complex, long lasting and systemic. In addition to positioning you in some circles as a social outcast, being forced to step in to whatever weather conditions exist to feed the habit; cigarette smokers are now restricted in restaurants, hotels and businesses. The concerns about second hand smoke have made cigarette users unable to smoke in public areas, sporting events and entertainment centers. Cigarette smoke effects nearly ever area of the body eventually. Respiratory issues are among the first to develop. The American Cancer Society reported in 2008 that smoking lowers the oxygen level in the body. The lack of oxygen can reduce energy levels. The lungs have tiny air sacs, which are damaged as soon as the smoke from cigarette tobacco hits them. Over time cigarette tobacco can lead to emphysema, cancer, pneumonia or bronchitis and even tuberculosis, as the effects of smoking tobacco ravages and ultimately destroy your lungs. Over time cigarette tobacco also impacts the circulatory system, drastically increasing your risk for stroke and heart attack. The cilia and blood vessels in the circulatory that aid in moving the blood through the body can be damaged. The heart beats faster, blood pressure rises. The risk for heart disease increases. The heart rate increases, the lining of the blood vessels can be affected, which may allow fat deposits to cling to the walls of the blood vessels, increasing arteriosclerosis or artery hardening. The restriction of circulation in the body can lead to painful neuropathy. This may lead to gangrene and could result in amputation of affected areas. The slowed blood flow can reduce the body’s ability to fight infections. Blood can be thickened and this can further reduce the oxygen flowing to various parts of the body. All of this adds up to taxing the heart, increasing the potential for heart related fatalities. The reproductive system is affected as well. The American Council on Science and Health reported in 1996 study the men’s risk of erectile dysfunction is twice as high in smokers. Mobility and quantity of sperm levels are affected by smoking as well. Breast and cervical cancer are increased risked for women who smoke cigarette tobacco. Women who are pregnant can lower birth weight, increase the likelihood of premature or stillborn babies, or having a miscarriage. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome is more common in babies of smoking parents. Tar and nicotine can be passed through breast milk to nursing infants. The digestive system is affected by cigarette tobacco as well. Intestines and stomach inflammation or ulcers can result from smoking cigarette tobacco. Skin quality is also affected with more wrinkles, decreasing elasticity and poor circulation. Bad breath, yellow or stained teeth and the lingering smell of cigarette tobacco can follow smokers as well. Smoking takes the lives of millions of cigarette users every year and hundreds of thousands of those impacted by second hand smoke. The risks are clear, systemic and pervasive. There is a clear correlation between cigarette tobacco use and poor health. Tobacco and health are clearly linked with serious and fatal complications likely. Death and destruction appear to be the inevitable consequences of smoking, living with a smoker and users of cigarette tobacco. The advice from most medical professionals is if you don’t smoke don’t start. If you do smoke, stop. Work with your medical professional for an integrated program that will allow you to be more successful in breaking the negative effects of tobacco and your health. One alternative which reduces the effects of exposure to the carcinogenic properties of cigarettes is what is known as the smokeless cigarette or electric cigarette. The device uses a nicotine vapor that is injected when the user inhales, and the user is not exposed to the side effects of combustion whatsoever. A wide variety of accessories and options can be found with today's electronic cigarettes to suit most consumers.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:3cef7863-0bee-46fd-82dd-4321c30415cb>"]},{"passage":"For example, dizziness could have a major impact on a user’s life style if it were serious enough to prevent driving or working, as was reported to us by an e-cigarette user. Users need to be aware that e-cigarettes are not free of health consequences and that numerous negative effects have been reported. For individuals who do not smoke conventional cigarettes and who do not currently use e-cigarettes, knowledge of these health effects may be important in helping them decide if they wish to begin e-cigarette use. Many e-cigarette users reported multiple positive or negative symptoms that often affected more than one system, as shown inand . The negative interactome for the Electronic Cigarette Forum demonstrated that when multiple systems are affected in individual e-cigarette users, there is often interaction between systems, such as respiratory and chest, respiratory and mouth\/throat, and digestive and neurological. This information may be useful to physicians treating patients who are using e-cigarettes and\/or have a prior history of smoking. The data may also be used to help diagnose health problems in patients for whom smoking\/e-cigarette history is not known. Although the positive interactome for the Electronic Cigarette Forum had fewer users, interactions between systems were similar to those observed in the negative interactome. In the negative Electronic Cigarette Forum interactome, many symptoms involved the neurological and sensory systems, and these may have been caused by an overdose or withdrawal of nicotine, which activates nicotinic cholinergic receptors in the brain . Some symptoms reported by e-cigarette users, such as vomiting, nausea, changes in heart rhythm, confusion, dizziness, and fatigue, would be consistent with a nicotine overdose [ ]. Because nicotine can be added to cartomizers\/cartridges, the potential to overdose exists. It is also possible that some reported symptoms, such as anxiety and depression, which are characteristic of nicotine withdrawal [ ], were caused by insufficient delivery of nicotine to some e-cigarette users. As previously shown, inexperienced users of e-cigarettes may not receive adequate levels of nicotine [ ]. While our study demonstrates the value of an infodemiological approach, it has several limitations. The online forums may be biased toward negative reporting, and the positive effects are probably under-reported in our analysis. In the current study, users posted effects that they observed after starting e-cigarette use and that they therefore attribute the effects to e-cigarettes. However, these results do not take into account past smoking and lifestyle history, pre-existing conditions, or other medical problems the users may have had before e-cigarette use began, any of which may have affected or even aggravated their response to e-cigarette aerosol. In addition, user posts cannot be validated, and it is possible that inaccurate information appears in the forums. Future work should be undertaken using methods that would acquire additional medical and lifestyle history of each user and that draw participants from a random sample of e-cigarette users. Additionally, our data do not address the effects that e-cigarette use may have on prenatal development, a period in the human life cycle that is particularly sensitive to environmental chemicals [, ]. Our recent study found that some e-cigarette refill fluids were highly toxic to human embryonic stem cells [ ], indicating the need for further work in this area. Our data will be helpful to e-cigarette users who may experience similar effects, to health care professionals advising individuals on e-cigarette usage, and to policy makers and legislators who regulate sales, use, and marketing of e-cigarettes. Interactome data may help health care workers identify problems caused by e-cigarette use, eg, problems with the respiratory system are often linked to problems with the neurological system. While it can be argued that e-cigarettes are safer than conventional tobacco-burning products, the data in this study demonstrate that e-cigarette users are not free of negative health effects. This study provides a preliminary synopsis of the short-term health effects related to e-cigarette use as reported in online forums. Effects occurred most often in the respiratory and neurological systems and in the mouth and throat with a total of 12 systems being affected.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:8b1222d6-f5f1-4d8d-8616-d2797edcbe88>"]},{"passage":"In the mid-twentieth century smoking in the United States was often associated with romance, relaxation, and adventure; movie stars oozed glamour on screen while smoking, and movie tough guys were never more masculine than when lighting up. Songs such as \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\" topped the hit parade. Smoking became a rite of passage for many young males and a sign of increasing independence for women. Since the 1990s, however, there has been an increase of opposition to tobacco use. Health authorities warn of the dangers of smoking and chewing tobacco, and nonsmokers object to secondhand smoke—because of both the smell and the health dangers of breathing smoke from other people's cigarettes. Today, a smoker is more likely to ask for permission before lighting up, and the answer is often \"no.\" Because of health concerns, smoking has been banned on airplanes, in hospitals, and in many workplaces, restaurants, and bars. PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF NICOTINE\nTobacco is a plant native to the Western Hemisphere. It contains nicotine, a drug classified as a stimulant, although it has some depressive effects as well. Nicotine is a poisonous alkaloid that is the major psychoactive (mood-altering) ingredient in tobacco. (Alkaloids are carbon- and nitrogen-containing compounds that are found in some families of plants. They have both poisonous and medicinal properties.) Nicotine's effects on the body are complex. The drug affects the brain and central nervous system as well as the hypothalamus and pituitary glands of the endocrine (hormone) system. Nicotine easily crosses the blood-brain barrier (a series of capillaries and cells that controls the flow of substances from the blood to the brain), and it accumulates in the brain—faster than caffeine or heroin, but slower than diazepam (a sedative medicine used to treat anxiety). In the brain nicotine imitates the actions of the hormone epinephrine (adrenaline) and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, both of which heighten awareness. Nicotine also triggers the release of dopamine, which enhances feelings of pleasure, and endorphins, \"the brain's natural opiates,\" which have a calming effect. As noted earlier, nicotine acts as both a stimulant and a depressant. By stimulating certain nerve cells in the spinal cord, nicotine relaxes the nerves and slows some reactions, such as the knee-jerk reflex. Small amounts of nicotine stimulate some nerve cells, but these cells are depressed by large amounts. In addition, nicotine stimulates the brain cortex (the outer layer of the brain) and affects the functions of the heart and lungs. TRENDS IN TOBACCO USE\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the consumption of cigarettes, the most widely used tobacco product, has decreased over the past generation among adults. After increasing rather consistently for sixty years, the per capita (per person) consumption of cigarettes peaked in the 1960s at well over four thousand cigarettes per year (\"Chronic Disease Notes and Reports,\" Fall 2001, http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nccdphp\/publications\/cdnr\/pdf\/CDNRfall2001.pdf). The steady decline in smoking came shortly after 1964, when the Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service (January 1964, http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/Tobacco\/sgr\/sgr_1964\/sgr64.htm) concluded that cigarette smoking is a cause of lung and laryngeal cancer in men, a probable cause of lung cancer in women, and the most important cause of chronic bronchitis in both genders. By 2006 the annual per capita consumption of cigarettes for those aged eighteen and over was 1,691. (See Table 3.1.)","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:3db9fb8a-c3d7-4f60-bd54-3dc0861a8184>"]}]}

If you are making your own dress, you need to take your own measurements. If you are dressmaking for another person, you need to schedule a session so you can take the necessary and important body measurements. You should include the necessary measurement tools in your dressmaking kit. The basic tool for measuring sizes is a tape measure. You can use a nylon or plastic tape measure for the purpose. Use the English standard measurement (i.e. inches). Before proceeding to measure anyone, be sure the person is not wearing bulky outfit. Advise the person to come wearing well-fitted undergarments. This is because oversized underwear may drastically affect the accuracy of measurements. For women, bras should fit well, and for men, boxers and other loose underwear should not be worn when in the session. Make the person to be measured stand correctly and in good body posture. He or she should stand proudly, with eyes gazing straight ahead and both arms very relaxed at either side. The back should be ideally straight and shoulders in a relaxed state. Some people do not naturally stand this proud, but advise the person you are measuring to observe correct and proud standing for the sake of getting accurate and ideal body measurements. There is a need to take a good position base. When finally measuring, take note that the job does not end in measuring the bust, the waist, and the hips. Other body areas should also be measured correctly. There can be differences in procedures when measuring men and women, but there are general body areas to scale. • To measure the chest, put the tape measure under the person’s arms. Wrap the tape measure around the area, specifically to the fullest bust line part. • To measure the waist line, put the measuring tape at the person’s belly button. Let the tool fall naturally. The area where it fell is the waist line, the measurement you should take. • Measure the fullest part of the person’s hip. • To measure the arm length, place the tape measure at the top of the arm in the armpit area extending until the wrist. Bend the arm without taking off the tape. Take the measurement as the arm length. • Take back length measurement after determining the length from the base of the neck until the waistline. • Measure the length from hip to heel to get the accurate leg measurement. In taking measurements before dressmaking, it is a standard practice to measure the areas thrice in one session. There might be differences resulting from changes in positions and starting points of measurements. There is a need to do so to ensure measurement accuracy.\n\nHow to Measure Your Body: Neck Around\nPlace the measuring tape around the neck at the height where the collar would normally rest.

You can find out your waist measurement easily, in the comfort of your home. Strip down to your underwear before starting the waist-measuring process. Stand up straight and relax your abdominal muscles. Find your natural waist. An easy way to do this is to stand in front of the mirror and bend at your side. The crease that forms indicates your natural waistline, directly above the belly button and below the ribcage. Wrap the measuring tape completely around your waist starting at the belly button. Begin at the spot on the tape where the measure reads \"0.\" Make sure the tape is level around your waistline--not too loose, not too tight. Do not place the measuring tape over clothes. You'll get the most accurate results on bare skin. However, make sure the tape is not squeezing into your skin. The number that meets the \"0\" after you have circled your entire waist is your waist measurement. Remove the tape and jot down your measurement for future reference. You may want to take your measurements in front of a full-length mirror to ensure you are measuring the right area and that the measuring tape isn't crooked. A healthy waistline for a woman is between 32 and 23 inches. For a man, it's between 45 and 32 inches. Make sure you use body measuring tape, which is made of fabric or bendable plastic. This will ensure more accurate results.\n\nIf you’re into online shopping, knowing your body measurements is a necessity to getting clothes in the right sizes. J.Crew sizing is different from H&M sizing, and retailers can even be inconsistent across their own line. Sizing inconsistencies can be attributed to different fabrics, updated cuts of products bearing the same name, and even vanity sizing. When taking your measurements, be sure to use a cloth measuring tape (or other options that we recommend in the absence of one) — not a metal measuring tape. This will ensure that you’re measuring your body accurately. In addition, measure only over bare skin or skin-tight clothes so as to ensure the most accurate measurements. What You Should Measure\nChest or Bust\nThis measurement is used for tops and dresses. Women: Place one end of the tape measure at the fullest part of your bust and wrap it around your body to get the measurement, keeping the tape parallel to the floor. Men and kids: Place one end of the tape measure at the center of your chest. Wrap it around your body, keeping the tape parallel to the floor. Bras are sized using a unique system based on two measurements of the bust area. For detailed instructions on how to measure to determine bra size and get a correct fit, please see: How to Measure for a Bra. This measurement is used for tops, dresses, and bottoms. Most clothing lines use the measurement of the “natural waist” for their size guides. To measure your natural waist, you want to find the narrowest part of your waist, located above your belly button and below your rib cage. Note some brands use a “low” waist measurement. For this, you would measure at the point where your trousers would normally ride.\n\nBy Jill Martin, Pierre A. Lehu.

And those measurements are exactly what you need to make those confusing online purchases much easier. I don’t want to measure every square inch of my body. Okay, fine. I was over-exaggerating anyway. You really only need 6, maybe 7, measurements. That’s it! With those 6 (or 7) measurements, you can buy any garment anywhere without having to try it on. Pretty nifty, right? So what parts of my body should I measure? Good question. To make it easy, why not take a look at this handy dandy diagram below:\nHere are some descriptive definitions for the more confusing ones:\nSleeve length: Measure from the base of the neck, across the traps to the shoulder, down the arm, to your wrist bone. Chest: Measure the widest part of your chest, usually across the nipples (ooh la la). Natural waist: Your natural waist is generally where your torso bends if you were to stand straight with your legs shoulder width apart, and tipped over slightly to one side. That crease sorta in the middle of your ribs? That’s your natural waist. Hip: Where your pants typically sit. If you finger that area (wow, really?) you can feel your hip bone. Your tape should come right across there, parallel to the ground. Inseam: Measure from the inside of your thigh (this is too much) to the heel. These are the only measurements you’ll need. Some tips on getting an accurate measurement\nThis is a little difficult to do if you’re on your own, unless you have something like this. If you’re not as fancy and you picked up traditional tailor’s tape, better get your patient significant other to help you out. Keep the tape straight\nIt’s really important to make sure the tape is level as your S.O. is wrapping it around your body parts (whoa). If it isn’t straight, chances are you’ll get a skewed measurement. An inch can make a big difference in the fit of your clothes, so make sure your designated measurer is as precise as possible. If you’re measuring your chest, waist, or hips, the tape should be parallel to the ground. Too loose = bad\nYou want to feel the tape wrapped around you. If it’s too loose, most likely it’s also not straight, so you’re going to get an inaccurate measurement no matter what. Too tight = bad\nYes, you want to feel the tape wrapped around you, but you don’t want to cinch it so snugly that your spare tire is cascading over it, enveloping the tape in a wall of skin and lard like some weird 80s horror film. Keep it firm, but not tight. Line it up\nHold one end, wrap the tape around your body, hold it firm, and match up the free end to the nearest line on the tape, like so:\nPretty simple, right? You want to do this for each of the areas listed in my handy dandy diagram above. Half or full? Some places give you measurements that look peculiarly small. For example, you may see a garment listed as having a 20″ chest measurement. Well that just means they measured across the chest without doubling the measurement. So your 40″ chest is 40″ because you went all the way around your body. While you’re at it, measure your clothes\nLet’s say you have a blazer that fits you perfectly.

Electroshock therapy (ECT) involves applying electrical currents directly to the client's head when they are sedated by anesthesia. While it can lead to short-term cognitive improvements, it is an invasive procedure that may require someone to take a break from work and home responsibilities. On the other hand, TMS therapy is non-invasive, passing electromagnetic currents through the skull. It is completely pain-free and has few side effects other than a temporary mild headache or skull discomfort. Who Should Avoid TMS Treatment? Clients who have permanent metal implants in their heads other than dental braces or fillings should not receive TMS therapy. The electromagnetic signals could cause these implants to heat up, move, or function incorrectly, risking injury or death. Implants that prevent a client from participating in TMS therapy include:\n- Deep brain stimulators\n- Aneurysm coils or clips\n- Tattoos on the face with metallic or magnetic ink\n- Electrodes that monitor brain activity\n- Any other metal medical devices or objects in or near the head\nThose considering TMS treatment should also speak with a doctor if they:\n- Take any medication\n- Have a history of seizures\n- Have a family history of epilepsy\n- Live with co-occurring mental disorders\n- Have a brain injury\n- Have had other medical conditions\n- Have previously been treated with TMS\n- Are pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant\nWhat Are the Side-Effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation?

Common side effects may include:\n- Scalp discomfort\n- Tingling, spasms, or twitching of facial muscles\n- Lightheadedness or dizziness\nThough these side effects are mild, doctors may be able to reduce them by adjusting the intensity of the magnetic fields. There is currently not enough evidence regarding the long-term side effects of TMS treatment. Mental Wellness Treatment and Neurodiversity - TMS Therapy Near Me\nNeurodiversity refers to the difference between the parts of the brain that impact the way people socialize, learn, feel, and behave. Neurodiversity supports the view that when a brain functions differently, it is not a disability or an illness that needs to be treated. Instead, those struggling should think about adapting their social structures to accommodate their differences.\n\nThe course of treatment will vary according to each individual. An initial assessment by Dr. Creelman will determine the appropriate dose of the magnetic pulse and the exact area of the brain the magnet should activate. Patients typically receive 20 – 30 treatments over four to six weeks. There may also be a taper phase. During the TMS treatment the patient is monitored to ensure correct positioning and comfort level. More patients in the most recent clinical studies who failed one antidepressant trial succeeded with TMS than any second antidepressant or therapy. Are There Risks and Side Effects with TMS? More than 10,000 treatments were safely performed just during clinical trials. Patient reported no side effects like those associated with antidepressant medication (weight gain, dry mouth, drowsiness, etc. ), no seizures and no cognitive side effects (memory loss, ability to concentrate). Scalp discomfort during the procedure is the most common side effect. TMS should not be used for patients with implanted metallic devices that include metal plates in the skull or aneurysm coils, clips or stents. Special precautions are recommended for individuals with implants such as pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators. Is TMS covered by insurance?

It is possible to treat your depressionwithout brain zaps, without medication. Many people do get their depression under control with the right treatment. A non-invasive, no medication alternative to antidepressants is transcranial magnetic stimulation. TMS is a non-invasive treatment for people dealing with depression. Numerousresearch studies have been conducted to proveits effectiveness, and it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2008 for severe depression. It is also a good alternative for people who have not found relief from antidepressants due to their preponderance of systemic effects. Transcranial magnetic stimulation uses magnets to stimulate a specific area of the brain that is related to depression. TMS promotes new brain cell activity in this area of the brain, which helps get the symptoms of depression under control. The few, mild side effects that can occur are scalp irritation at the treatment site and headache, both of which can be treated with over-the-counter pain relief. If you think that you have treatment-resistant depression, talk with your doctor about whether or not TMS would work for you. What is a Brain Zap?

Research on TMS and depression have found that the electromagnetic pulses, when applied to depressed areas of the brain, activates neurons thought to be responsible for depression symptoms. Why would someone choose TMS Along with medication? Medications are often the first line of defense in treating depression. Most patients will respond favorably to antidepressants. However, sometimes people need additional help. TMS can help those who are experiencing treatment-resistant depression. Also, medications can come with a range of side effects and other issues.

It frequently goes undiagnosed and untreated. The World Health Organization (WHO) lists it as one of the top causes of disability globally. Every day, people suffer from symptoms that cause difficulties in carrying out their activities of daily living. Thankfully, there are numerous pharmacological treatments, in addition to psychotherapy, that help many individuals lead normal lives. Unfortunately, for some individuals, their symptoms persist despite these treatments. If you are one of these individuals, you may benefit from non-medication-based interventions such as transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy. What Is Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation or TMS? Since its approval by the FDA in 2008, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has become an enticing treatment for depression. It is a non-invasive treatment that can be used by itself or in conjunction with psychotherapy and medication. Typically an electromagnetic coil is placed just above the left temple to deliver magnetic pulses. It helps stimulate cortical neurons to improve your mood and reduce symptoms of depression. The goal is to activate the areas of the brain with decreased activity that can be contributing to depression or other mental health symptoms. How Can I Determine if TMS Could Work for Me? Many factors go into treating depression, and a personalized treatment plan developed with a doctor is required to treat it effectively. Here are a couple of valuable points to consider when determining if TMS is right for you. ● Medication Side Effects\nMedications used to treat depression can have intolerable side effects such as sleep problems, GI upset, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction. These side effects can have a minor impact on your daily life or can be debilitating in more extreme cases. On the other hand, TMS has little to no short-term side effects. The most common side effect reported has been scalp discomfort from the coil placement during the period of active stimulation. The worst side effect would be the occasional headaches that occur while acclimating to the stimulation and resolve shortly within starting treatment. There have been no long-term side effects reported due to TMS therapy other than continued relief from depression symptoms. ● No Relief\nMany medications treat depression and approximately half of patients will respond to the first antidepressant treatment. However, up to 40% of patients with depression do not experience relief from their symptoms with medications at all. Consequently, their diagnosis may change to treatment-resistant depression. If a patient has taken two or more full anti-depression medication courses as prescribed, they can be diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression. They do need to take it at the full dose considered effective for the entire length of time, often up to 14 weeks. If you fall into this category, non-medication treatment routes should be explored, including TMS therapy. NeuroStim TMS treatment results are encouraging. Since 2018, NeuroStim TMS have performed over 65,000 successful TMS treatments and over 70% of our patients have experienced greater than 50% improvement in their depressive symptoms. Additionally, 46% have achieved full remission. Even if you are not diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression, you may find that you only achieve partial relief from medication, and TMS can further improve symptoms. When used alongside psychotherapy, it often has the most significant impact to help develop coping strategies for your symptoms in these scenarios. While some medications are categorized as safe to be taken when pregnant, most patients planning to become pregnant need to discontinue their antidepressant medication. Unfortunately, this is a risk for the patient and her baby. TMS may be an excellent non-pharmacological option during this time. ● Medical History\nUnfortunately, if you have been diagnosed with a seizure disorder, you are not a candidate for TMS therapy due to the risks seizures pose. Additionally, if you have brain or neural implants, permanent metal in the body, or previous brain damage from illness or injury, TMS treatment may not be safe for you. Talk with your doctor about your medical history before beginning a course of treatment. If you have previously undergone TMS treatment and found it ineffective, that can change. As your depression, diagnosis, and body change, you may find you are more responsive to TMS therapy than in the past.\n\nNeuroStar TMS Therapy is well tolerated and has been proven to be safe in clinical trials. Throughout over 10,000 active treatments performed in clinical trials, the most commonly reported side effect related to treatment were scalp pain or discomfort during treatment sessions. These side effects were generally mild to moderate, and occurred less frequently after the first week of treatment. Less than 5% of patients treated with NeuroStar TMS Therapy discontinued treatment due to side effects. In NeuroStar clinical trials, over 10,000 TMS treatments demonstrated its safety, with no occurrence of seizures. However, there is a small risk of a seizure occurring during treatment. This risk is no greater than what has been observed with oral antidepressant medications. While NeuroStar TMS Therapy has been proven effective, not all patients will benefit from it. Patients should be carefully monitored for worsening symptoms, signs or symptoms of suicidal behavior, and\/or unusual behavior. Families and caregivers should also be aware of the need to observe patients and notify their treatment provider if symptoms worsen. NeuroStar TMS Therapy should not be used (is contraindicated) in patients with implanted metallic devices or non-removable metallic objects in or around the head. NeuroStar TMS Therapy should be used with caution in patients with implanted devices that are controlled by physiological signals. This includes pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). It should be used in caution with patients using wearable cardioverter defibrillators. No, NeuroStar TMS Therapy uses the same type and strength of magnetic fields as MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging), which have been used in tens of millions of patients around the world and have not been shown to cause tumors. The magnetic energy used in a full course of TMS Therapy is a small fraction of just one brain scan with an MRI. No, NeuroStar TMS Therapy was systematically evaluated for its effects on memory. Clinical trials demonstrated that NeuroStar TMS Therapy does not result in any negative effects on memory or concentration. The most common side effect related to treatment is scalp pain or discomfort during treatment sessions — generally mild to moderate. If necessary, you can treat this discomfort with an over-the-counter analgesic. If these side effects persist, your doctor can temporarily reduce the strength of the magnetic field pulses being administered in order to make treatment more comfortable. Less than 5% of patients treated with NeuroStar TMS Therapy discontinued treatment due to side effects. In most patients, the clinical benefit of NeuroStar TMS Therapy was maintained through 6 months of follow-up study. Talk to your doctor about your long-term treatment path. Yes. In clinical trials, NeuroStar TMS Therapy was safely administered with and without other antidepressant medications. Will NeuroStar TMS Therapy be covered by my insurance and\/or Medicare? Most insurance companies now offer coverage for TMS. You can schedule a free half-hour meeting with our TMS coordinator to discuss the cost of TMS, insurance coverage, payment schedules, and financing options. No commitments are made during this meeting. You may do this on the phone (352-240-6011) or at the office. How long does it take for the effects to become noticeable? In clinical trials, most patients who benefited from NeuroStar TMS Therapy experienced results by the fourth week of treatment. Some patients may experience results in less time, while others may take longer. You should discuss your depression symptoms with your physician throughout the treatment course. If symptoms persist or worsen, you should discuss this with your doctor and consider other antidepressant treatment options.\n\nAre you suffering from severe depression? Having complications in sleep? Depression is a simple term that began by taking stress. Stress is a result of small tensions of life, in everyone’s life we all have to face some dumps. Depression can be a very severe condition for one person and it can change your life ridiculously.

Information about TMS treatment:\nWith the rise of technology in the medical field, there are so many depression treatments that are launched such as Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). In this article, we will get everything about Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. It’s the usage and the effects on you. This treatment has great effects on so many conditions. So let’s take a look at TMS quickly! - What is Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS): This depression treatment is using magnetic fields which stimulate the nerve cells which improve depression symptoms. This treatment is done after all the not working treatments of depression. In this treatment, the TMS specialist passes repetitive pulses that are magnetic. Therefore, it is also called rTMS treatment. - What is the process of TMS treatment: first of all you will be seated on the chair which should be comfortable. Than your scalp is covered by an electromagnetic coil. This treatment is fully painless. The coil transfers magnetic pulses to your brain for improving mood swings and other issues. Every expert uses some different techniques for this treatment depends upon his efficiency and understanding of the TMS. - Preparation of TMS treatment: when you select TMS treatment for you or you’re loved once then the process is started. First, you have to pass some tests of physical and Psychiatric evaluation. So that there is full safety of health during the treatment. If you have some other conditions like you are pregnant, if you have any metal device with you, or if you are taking other medications than letting the TMS specialist know about each and everything about you. - More about the procedure of treatment: this TMS treatment is not done only in one session you have to take a series of this treatment.

These differ between types of antidepressants (TCAs, SSRIs, SNRIs) and, to a lesser extent, between different ones of the same type. It is important to discuss how likely particular side effects are with your doctor when choosing a medication and to discuss your experience of these as your treatment progresses. SSRIs are used most often, as they are less likely to cause side effects. However, some people find they cause nausea, particularly in the first week of treatment. Other side effects include difficulty going to sleep, nervousness, headaches and sexual problems, particularly delayed orgasm. Rarely, they can cause diarrhoea. Very rarely, they can cause extreme agitation, jerky movements, a high temperature and confusion - if this occurs, it is important to seek urgent medical attention, as people with this 'serotonin syndrome' can become very ill if they are not treated. This is more likely if SSRIs are combined with certain other antidepressants. Side effects of venlafaxine may include nausea, reduced appetite, headache, sweating, rashes, agitation and sexual difficulties. Side effects of TCAs include a dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, difficulty urinating, sedation, sexual problems and weight gain. It is not a good idea to drink alcohol when depressed as it tends to worsen the depression. It also interacts with TCAs, increasing sedation. If you are experiencing side effects, discuss these with your doctor. It may be possible to adjust the dose or change the medication to control them. All medications must be taken as prescribed by your doctor. You can discuss adverse side effects and interactions with other medications with your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nWhile ECT stimulates the entire brain using current from electricity, TMS uses magnetic impulses to strengthen the brain’s ability to regulate mood. The latter is noninvasive, meaning that it works perfectly in an outpatient setting. Unlike ECT, the patient walks home confidently a minute after the therapy. The safety of the brain stimulation procedure is a multilevel challenge, including prevention and management of adverse effects, strategies for patient selection and stimulation protocols, and ensuring patient safety and monitoring during the procedure. Common unwanted effects of TMS include neck pain and headache, syncope, and transient hearing changes. The risk of provoking an epileptic seizure is extremely low and minimized with careful patient selection and the use of safe stimulation protocols. When planning the TMS procedure, it is important to select patients taking into account a large number of risk factors for adverse effects, as well as absolute and relative contraindications for stimulation. Today, the maximum allowable values of the listed parameters are regulated in the safety guidelines, and their change is allowed only in clinical trials. To ensure safety, a number of organizational measures must be observed, including monitoring the patient’s condition during the procedure and the possibility of providing qualified assistance in case of adverse events. 6. TMS therapy is only the patient head, but effects wore off after\nBefore implementing TMS treatment, for national institute of mental health funded several tests and trials of the therapy to pinpoint its effectiveness using a double-blind controlled group. During a study back in 2007, about 150 patients received TMS therapy while about 140 patients received fake TMS treatment. The first group portrayed better results than the latter. There is always a physical change with regards to the communication after a patient has undergone TMS treatment. For over a decade, the TMS treatment has proven effective for people suffering from depression and related disorders.\n\n### Question: What are the common side effects associated with TMS treatment for depression?","passages":[{"passage":"Side effects and medication option for TMS\nDepression is one of the leading causes of disability in the US among the people between 15-44 years of age. Mental health conditions and depression are confusing and overwhelming, but the good news is that the relief is now possible as there are more advanced treatment options available than ever before to help you live a healthy life. Depression generally leads to isolation from the friends and family, and an only medical professional can provide the necessary help. Most often, medication and talk therapy help decrease depression, but those with major depressive disorder or treatment-resistant depression need to try multiple medications or advanced therapies like TMS. TMS is a non-invasive and drug-free therapy prescribed for patients who suffer from MDD and don’t respond well to medication. TMS delivers electromagnetic pulses to the pre-frontal cortex that regulates mood and stimulate cortical neurons to relieve the depression symptoms. Approximately 50-60% of people suffering from depression who have tried and failed to benefit from medications, witness full remission with TMS. In 2008, FDA cleared TMS for treating depression, and it is administered in sessions that generally last for 30-40 minutes, five times a week over 4-6 weeks. No sedation or anesthesia is given to the patients; therefore, they can resume their usual activities right after their session. Repeated treatment encourages the formation of new circuits providing relief to the patients. Unlike depression medications, TMS is not associated with systemic side effects that are caused by the passage of drugs through the bloodstream. Only reported side effect of TMS is mild-to-moderate discomfort caused by the electromagnetic pulses. Some of the common side effects include:\n2. Spasms, tingling, and twitching of the facial muscles\n3. Discomfort in the scalp at the site of stimulation\nYou can ask the doctor to adjust the stimulation level to reduce the symptoms if you experience painful scalp sensation or facial twitching. Or can take over-the-counter pain medication and tend to lessen over the course of treatmen1t. There is minimal risk of seizure. To ensure that you are eligible for TMS a physical examination and psychiatric evolution to discuss depression is done. The evaluation helps you make sure that TMS is safe and a good option. TMS is not safe in the following conditions:\nYou are pregnant or planning to get pregnant\nThere is an implanted medical device in the body\nYou have a history of seizures\nThere is brain damage from past injury or illness\nYou suffer from frequent headaches\nTo ensure you get the best treatment, it is suggested to look for a well-reputed clinic. Getting the treatment from experienced practitioners and healthcare providers will ensure exceptional comfort and minimum side effects. Before you start the therapy, make an appointment and see if you are comfortable with them, and you feel calm at the clinic. Also, check whether the clinic accepts health insurance as most health insurance companies these days cover TMS treatment.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:006fbb26-e254-4535-8f97-45999dcce05e>"]},{"passage":"TMS can improve depression symptoms in clients with treatment-resistant depression who have not responded to other depression treatments like antidepressant medications or talk therapy. It also has far fewer side effects than antidepressant medication, which can lead to weight gain and high blood pressure. TMS for Bipolar Disorder\nTMS can be an effective treatment for symptoms of bipolar disorder as it can increase the excitability of brain activity in the target area of the brain, improving symptoms of depression. While studies have found that it may induce manic or hypomanic symptoms through stimulation, almost all bipolar disorder treatments carry this risk. TMS for Teens and Kids\nMood disorders like depression are widespread among children and teens across the world. Inadequate treatment can lead to conduct disorders, illness, poor performance at school, and a greater risk of suicide. The good news is that depression in teens is treatable and can open the doors to the future they dream of. TMS therapy can be an effective treatment for young people with depression, and the procedure's minimal side effects and accessibility make it an attractive option for young people who may want to fit TMS treatment alongside their work or studies. What Is Deep TMS Therapy? Deep TMS therapy is a form of TMS therapy that uses special combinations of coils. These coils produce electromagnetic pulses that reach below the surface of the skull, and different coils are used to reach each brain region. The FDA has approved deep TMS with the 'H1' coil for the treatment of people with treatment-resistant depression who have not responded to psychotherapy or medicine. How Much Does TMS Therapy Cost? TMS therapy can be one of the most cost-effective treatments for depression and other medical conditions. Many insurance providers cover TMS therapy under certain conditions. We accept a number of insurances as well as have payment options. To get more information contact us. We are available 24 hours a day. Is TMS Treatment the Same As Shock Therapy? Electroshock therapy (ECT) involves applying electrical currents directly to the client's head when they are sedated by anesthesia. While it can lead to short-term cognitive improvements, it is an invasive procedure that may require someone to take a break from work and home responsibilities. On the other hand, TMS therapy is non-invasive, passing electromagnetic currents through the skull. It is completely pain-free and has few side effects other than a temporary mild headache or skull discomfort. Who Should Avoid TMS Treatment? Clients who have permanent metal implants in their heads other than dental braces or fillings should not receive TMS therapy. The electromagnetic signals could cause these implants to heat up, move, or function incorrectly, risking injury or death. Implants that prevent a client from participating in TMS therapy include:\n- Deep brain stimulators\n- Aneurysm coils or clips\n- Tattoos on the face with metallic or magnetic ink\n- Electrodes that monitor brain activity\n- Any other metal medical devices or objects in or near the head\nThose considering TMS treatment should also speak with a doctor if they:\n- Take any medication\n- Have a history of seizures\n- Have a family history of epilepsy\n- Live with co-occurring mental disorders\n- Have a brain injury\n- Have had other medical conditions\n- Have previously been treated with TMS\n- Are pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant\nWhat Are the Side-Effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation? Side effects of TMS treatment are usually mild to moderate and improve soon after each session. They also tend to decrease as clients participate in sessions throughout their treatment. Common side effects may include:\n- Scalp discomfort\n- Tingling, spasms, or twitching of facial muscles\n- Lightheadedness or dizziness\nThough these side effects are mild, doctors may be able to reduce them by adjusting the intensity of the magnetic fields. There is currently not enough evidence regarding the long-term side effects of TMS treatment. Mental Wellness Treatment and Neurodiversity - TMS Therapy Near Me\nNeurodiversity refers to the difference between the parts of the brain that impact the way people socialize, learn, feel, and behave. Neurodiversity supports the view that when a brain functions differently, it is not a disability or an illness that needs to be treated. Instead, those struggling should think about adapting their social structures to accommodate their differences.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:9e04444c-5363-4493-b522-4b325d58cec3>"]},{"passage":"The course of treatment will vary according to each individual. An initial assessment by Dr. Creelman will determine the appropriate dose of the magnetic pulse and the exact area of the brain the magnet should activate. Patients typically receive 20 – 30 treatments over four to six weeks. There may also be a taper phase. During the TMS treatment the patient is monitored to ensure correct positioning and comfort level. More patients in the most recent clinical studies who failed one antidepressant trial succeeded with TMS than any second antidepressant or therapy. Are There Risks and Side Effects with TMS? More than 10,000 treatments were safely performed just during clinical trials. Patient reported no side effects like those associated with antidepressant medication (weight gain, dry mouth, drowsiness, etc. ), no seizures and no cognitive side effects (memory loss, ability to concentrate). Scalp discomfort during the procedure is the most common side effect. TMS should not be used for patients with implanted metallic devices that include metal plates in the skull or aneurysm coils, clips or stents. Special precautions are recommended for individuals with implants such as pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators. Is TMS covered by insurance?

TMS: TREAT YOUR DEPRESSION WITHOUT BRAIN ZAPS, WITHOUT MEDICATION\nMany people give up on their depression treatment if they experience side effects or they feel as though their current treatment isn’t working. Giving up on treatment can leave you feeling discouraged and hopeless. It can be demoralizing when the symptoms return after stopping the medication. It can also be dangerous, in the case of discontinuation syndrome, to unilaterally decide to stop treatment. If you have experienced side effects like brain shakes or brain zaps after stopping antidepressants or the symptoms have returned, don’t give up on treatment. It is possible to treat your depressionwithout brain zaps, without medication. Many people do get their depression under control with the right treatment. A non-invasive, no medication alternative to antidepressants is transcranial magnetic stimulation. TMS is a non-invasive treatment for people dealing with depression. Numerousresearch studies have been conducted to proveits effectiveness, and it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2008 for severe depression. It is also a good alternative for people who have not found relief from antidepressants due to their preponderance of systemic effects. Transcranial magnetic stimulation uses magnets to stimulate a specific area of the brain that is related to depression. TMS promotes new brain cell activity in this area of the brain, which helps get the symptoms of depression under control. The few, mild side effects that can occur are scalp irritation at the treatment site and headache, both of which can be treated with over-the-counter pain relief. If you think that you have treatment-resistant depression, talk with your doctor about whether or not TMS would work for you. What is a Brain Zap? Also known as “brain shakes”, “brain shocks” or “brain flips, a brain zap is a phenomenon that occurs as a result of decreasing the dosage or ceasing antidepressants\nWhat are the most common side effects of Antidepressants? The most common side effects of antidepressants are insomnia, blurred vision, dry mouth, fatigue, weight gain, nausea, GI distress and sexual dysfunction. What are the most common side effects of TMS? The most common side effects of TMS are scalp discomfort and headache. Can I stop taking antidepressants?

It frequently goes undiagnosed and untreated. The World Health Organization (WHO) lists it as one of the top causes of disability globally. Every day, people suffer from symptoms that cause difficulties in carrying out their activities of daily living. Thankfully, there are numerous pharmacological treatments, in addition to psychotherapy, that help many individuals lead normal lives. Unfortunately, for some individuals, their symptoms persist despite these treatments. If you are one of these individuals, you may benefit from non-medication-based interventions such as transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy. What Is Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation or TMS? Since its approval by the FDA in 2008, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has become an enticing treatment for depression. It is a non-invasive treatment that can be used by itself or in conjunction with psychotherapy and medication. Typically an electromagnetic coil is placed just above the left temple to deliver magnetic pulses. It helps stimulate cortical neurons to improve your mood and reduce symptoms of depression. The goal is to activate the areas of the brain with decreased activity that can be contributing to depression or other mental health symptoms. How Can I Determine if TMS Could Work for Me? Many factors go into treating depression, and a personalized treatment plan developed with a doctor is required to treat it effectively. Here are a couple of valuable points to consider when determining if TMS is right for you. ● Medication Side Effects\nMedications used to treat depression can have intolerable side effects such as sleep problems, GI upset, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction. These side effects can have a minor impact on your daily life or can be debilitating in more extreme cases. On the other hand, TMS has little to no short-term side effects. The most common side effect reported has been scalp discomfort from the coil placement during the period of active stimulation. The worst side effect would be the occasional headaches that occur while acclimating to the stimulation and resolve shortly within starting treatment. There have been no long-term side effects reported due to TMS therapy other than continued relief from depression symptoms. ● No Relief\nMany medications treat depression and approximately half of patients will respond to the first antidepressant treatment. However, up to 40% of patients with depression do not experience relief from their symptoms with medications at all. Consequently, their diagnosis may change to treatment-resistant depression. If a patient has taken two or more full anti-depression medication courses as prescribed, they can be diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression. They do need to take it at the full dose considered effective for the entire length of time, often up to 14 weeks. If you fall into this category, non-medication treatment routes should be explored, including TMS therapy. NeuroStim TMS treatment results are encouraging. Since 2018, NeuroStim TMS have performed over 65,000 successful TMS treatments and over 70% of our patients have experienced greater than 50% improvement in their depressive symptoms. Additionally, 46% have achieved full remission. Even if you are not diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression, you may find that you only achieve partial relief from medication, and TMS can further improve symptoms. When used alongside psychotherapy, it often has the most significant impact to help develop coping strategies for your symptoms in these scenarios. While some medications are categorized as safe to be taken when pregnant, most patients planning to become pregnant need to discontinue their antidepressant medication. Unfortunately, this is a risk for the patient and her baby. TMS may be an excellent non-pharmacological option during this time. ● Medical History\nUnfortunately, if you have been diagnosed with a seizure disorder, you are not a candidate for TMS therapy due to the risks seizures pose. Additionally, if you have brain or neural implants, permanent metal in the body, or previous brain damage from illness or injury, TMS treatment may not be safe for you. Talk with your doctor about your medical history before beginning a course of treatment. If you have previously undergone TMS treatment and found it ineffective, that can change. As your depression, diagnosis, and body change, you may find you are more responsive to TMS therapy than in the past.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e5d5ab92-1f41-474d-b218-a6c15762a1ac>"]},{"passage":"NeuroStar TMS Therapy is well tolerated and has been proven to be safe in clinical trials.

These differ between types of antidepressants (TCAs, SSRIs, SNRIs) and, to a lesser extent, between different ones of the same type. It is important to discuss how likely particular side effects are with your doctor when choosing a medication and to discuss your experience of these as your treatment progresses. SSRIs are used most often, as they are less likely to cause side effects. However, some people find they cause nausea, particularly in the first week of treatment. Other side effects include difficulty going to sleep, nervousness, headaches and sexual problems, particularly delayed orgasm. Rarely, they can cause diarrhoea. Very rarely, they can cause extreme agitation, jerky movements, a high temperature and confusion - if this occurs, it is important to seek urgent medical attention, as people with this 'serotonin syndrome' can become very ill if they are not treated. This is more likely if SSRIs are combined with certain other antidepressants. Side effects of venlafaxine may include nausea, reduced appetite, headache, sweating, rashes, agitation and sexual difficulties. Side effects of TCAs include a dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, difficulty urinating, sedation, sexual problems and weight gain. It is not a good idea to drink alcohol when depressed as it tends to worsen the depression. It also interacts with TCAs, increasing sedation. If you are experiencing side effects, discuss these with your doctor. It may be possible to adjust the dose or change the medication to control them. All medications must be taken as prescribed by your doctor. You can discuss adverse side effects and interactions with other medications with your doctor or pharmacist.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:2a1c9fb1-38b2-49f5-a475-d3dc98acaa2a>"]},{"passage":"While ECT stimulates the entire brain using current from electricity, TMS uses magnetic impulses to strengthen the brain’s ability to regulate mood. The latter is noninvasive, meaning that it works perfectly in an outpatient setting. Unlike ECT, the patient walks home confidently a minute after the therapy. The safety of the brain stimulation procedure is a multilevel challenge, including prevention and management of adverse effects, strategies for patient selection and stimulation protocols, and ensuring patient safety and monitoring during the procedure. Common unwanted effects of TMS include neck pain and headache, syncope, and transient hearing changes. The risk of provoking an epileptic seizure is extremely low and minimized with careful patient selection and the use of safe stimulation protocols. When planning the TMS procedure, it is important to select patients taking into account a large number of risk factors for adverse effects, as well as absolute and relative contraindications for stimulation. Today, the maximum allowable values of the listed parameters are regulated in the safety guidelines, and their change is allowed only in clinical trials. To ensure safety, a number of organizational measures must be observed, including monitoring the patient’s condition during the procedure and the possibility of providing qualified assistance in case of adverse events. 6.

Cole ruffled a few purple hairs with the finale track of his newly released KOD album, 1985 (Intro to ‘The Fall Off’). Some clumsily labeled the record a “diss” track at the millennial rap generation, namely Lil Pump: the 17-year-old Miami rapper who dropped an unprovoked “F**k J. Cole” diss song. But it’s actually a page from Cole’s 33-year-old book of wisdom that he was generous enough to share with the emerging rap generation beneath him without needing to resort to a “diss” record. However, according to Coke Boys founder French Montana, “every generation of hip-hop” is to be respected. The South Bronx native spoke with LA Weekly after a question about hip-hop enthusiasts who “hate” on Lil Pump. French said that he loves what the rapper is doing for the rap game, though it isn’t clear what that specifically is. “I love what Tupac and Biggie did for the game, I also love what Run-DMC and them did for the game,” he continued. “I just feel like the game just changes.” The “Unforgettable” rapper championed the financially elevated lifestyle rap has afforded artists in this day and age as it “just shows growth.” Without name-dropping anyone, French believes that anyone who doesn’t like Pump shouldn’t listen to him, anyway, especially since there are still lyrical artists existing in the current state of rap. “Whatever kind of rap you want to listen to, go listen to it,” he said. “I love Lil Pump’s music.” As aforementioned, French doesn't specifically name anyone, but also doesn’t speak much to Pump’s shots at Cole which—if anyone could take a wild guess—might presumably stem from not appreciating or liking the Dreamville leader as a “lyrical” artist. He’ll be happy to know he has at least one friend and fan in French. See the purple-haired rapper’s new attempt at Cole’s attention in the video below.

The History of Hip-Hop and Rap\nTranscript of The History of Hip-Hop and Rap\nRap starts getting more popular and spreading around the U.S. when its irresistible tune gets stuck in peoples heads and they just can't get enough. The Golden Era of Rap began in 1984 when most of the rappers were popular enough to go on tour. From 1986 to 1989 the rap business grows quickly, spreading across the United States. As rap kept growing, adults realized there was use of explicit language and they watched it closely, not wanting it to influence children and teens. The parental concern was not enough to stop the growth of this popular culture. Rap became more popular and it created new generations of artists who became businessmen. These businessmen started their own record companies and had the power to sign artists and determine how much money they would make. Rap continued to gain in popularity during this Golden Era even though bad language and violence were some of its features and artists continued to dominate the music and social scenes. Hip hop artists sport golden chains, live in Hollywood mansions and make their own brand of head phones. Read on to find how they got there and how long they'll stay! Hip-hop was first born in the mid nineteen seventies around New York. It was inhabited by a large segment of lower class African-Americans and was used for entertainment when they had nothing to do. Dancing, DJing and grafetti kept these kids busy and out of trouble. Hip-hop has many different features, it is not just music. Some things hip hop covers is rap, DJing, graffiti, and even B-boying or break dancing. In New York, the hip-hop trend starts gaining momentum because new hip-hop artists are creating new hits. Rappers start producing better improved songs that send chills down your spine such as the Shugarhill Gang's hit “Rappers Delight.\" Hip-hop comes in many different forms and genres. The Roots of Hip-Hop\nHip-Hop Microphone: http:\/\/cdn8.staztic.com\/app\/a\/1042\/1042965\/hip-hop-and-rap-radio-android-4-2-s-307x512.jpg\nBaker, Soren. The History of Hip-Hop and Rap. Detroit: Lucent, 2006. Print. The Golden Era of Rap\nThere are many different types of rap. Once the Golden Era of rap stopped gaining momentum, a new types of rap emerged. Gangster rap, battle rap, and crunk are three of the most popular U.S. genres. This new style was called “Gangster Rap” it was a more explicit form of music. Gangster Rap has a lot of violent lyrics that make you flinch. For example, Melle Mel's song “The Message” makes you want to cover your ears because of the dirty lyrics. Recently, this type of rap has come under fire for its violent themes. Battle rap began when rappers starting to compete for hit songs. A battle rap is when one rapper insults another while making himself look good. This prompts a competition between different groups within the music industry as groups are trying to maintain popularity. Crunk began in the dance clubs and has a loud, heavy beat. These songs are high pitched and drum heavy with catchy lyrics. Crunk stands for \"crazy and drunk.\" Rap has many different genres and continues to show up in mainstream culture. In spite of its bad language and violent themes, it has shown that if artists have something good to say, people will listen. Hip-hop is now a hit around the world, everybody loves it. Even though hip-hop was born in the U.S it has now spread around the world. You will find it in places like Brazil, Cuba, New Zeland, and even as far as China.\n\nlearn how to Supercharge your Career in the Music Industry:\nHip hop has become a powerful force in popular culture and made an indelible mark on the world. It originated as an urban African American cultural movement in the late 1960s in the South Bronx, New York where a marginalized community had little to call their own. They found a voice with hip-hop and have since gone on to influence fashion, music, film, art, and more. Hip-hop is an integral part of American pop culture, making waves in fashion, television, movies, retail sales, and literature. As such, it is a multi-billion dollar industry. The music is a multi-genre, multicultural experience that draws artists of other genres into its vortex. But hip hop’s beginnings were downright humble and anything but omnipotent. We look at the history of this now-powerful, iconic genre, starting with hip hop’s progenitors, through to its meteoric rise to dominance. You’ll learn about the four elements of hip hop and how the genre has grown throughout the decades. Battle rapping, hardcore and gangsta rap, boom bap, and more–and how all of those derivatives have their own look, lifestyle, and song topics. At the end of this course, you’ll be able to define what hip hop is, summarize the key words and symbols used in the genre, and identify differences in hip hop subgenres. The Listening Library will have you listen to three artists discussed in the course and explain why you chose them, what you learned from them, and any ideas you may have gotten from them. You’ll also watch episode six of Hip Hop Evolution, centering on Tupac and his influence on the genre.

Two of my first influences outside of music were my Mom and Grandpa. My mother would always play diverse music around me from Tina Turner and Whitney Houston to New Edition and solo Bobby Brown. Doing this gave me an appreciation for different styles. Next my Grandpa would always sing around me and I can remember watching a documentary with him on Sam Cooke and how he basically was “Berry Gordy” before Berry Gordy with his discovery and production of numerous artists. One of those Artists in particular Bobby Womack is one of my music influences. His music is extremely soulful, unapologetic, and heartfelt. Next on the Hip Hop side I was influenced by 2Pac, KRS-One, Ice Cube, Busta Rhymez, and T.I. As a fan of Hip Hop, I loved the unapologetic delivery of 2Pac, KRS-One, and Ice Cube. As a person I also loved the High energy that Busta Rhymes and T.I. displayed. 7) If you could choose to collaborate with 3 other artists on the same track – who would they be? I would love to perform on Neptunes produced track with Andre 3000, Janelle Monae, and Big K.R.I.T. 8) How do you currently make money as an independent hip-hop artists? I have my own business outside of music that specializes in legal document preparation, tax services, notarial acts, and fingerprinting. 9) What are you hoping to achieve with your music? My main goal is to share an often silenced element of Hip Hop which is standing up and fighting oppression. Hip Hop was started due to oppression in the South Bronx, but that message has been muted and ignored over the years. Now in recent times it has been coming back, but it generally doesn’t sustain because it may come off as too preachy to most people. I want to make it a lifestyle instead of a trend so that people do it as naturally as breathing. 10) What do you think is the biggest barrier an artist like yourself has to overcome, to gain commercial success? One of the biggest things would be finding my own niche market. I make music about Black Empowerment, but my songs aren’t exactly along the lines of Public Enemy or A Tribe Called Quest. I make music for the person that doesn’t like racism, but may not have read a Malcolm X book or marched in a protest. A lot of my listeners like going to the club or buying Air Jordan shoes, but when you get into conversations about Black Empowerment, they are ridiculed and ignored. I want my music to be an introduction in to consciousness for that ignored audience. The biggest challenge with that is making music that they will enjoy without being judgmental also while still maintaining the same high energy and excitement of today’s music industry while staying true to myself as a person.\n\nWelcome to the Hip-Hop Music Research Guide! Historically, hip hop has had a strong, international influence on music and culture. It continues to be a powerful part of our society. The library recognizes it as a significant research area. This research guide provides resources that will help you find published research about hip hop's influence from social, economic and many other points of view. Use these resources to develop and support your research interests. Barack Obama - \"The thing about hip-hop today is it's smart, it's insightful. The way they can communicate a complex message in a very short space is remarkable.\" Isaac Hayes - \"A certain administration which I won't call by name took the arts out of the schools, and that left the brothers out on the street with nothing, so they went to the turntables and started rhyming. Then they had a way to express themselves, and that's the birth of hip-hop.\" John F. Kerry - \"I'm fascinated by rap and by hip-hop. I think there's a lot of poetry in it. There's a lot of anger, a lot of social energy in it. And I think you'd better listen to it pretty carefully, 'cause it's important.\" Russell Simmons - \"The thing about hip-hop is that it's from the underground, ideas from the underbelly, from people who have mostly been locked out, who have not been recognized.\" Talib Kweli - \"Hip-hop is a vehicle.\"\n\nHaligonian rapper, producer, and academic lectures for Black History Month. Mike McGuire, both an artist and student of the genre, talked hip-hop last week at Mount Allison. McGuire is a recent graduate of Mount Saint Vincent University, whose time there culminated in a thesis on the history of hip-hop in Halifax; his talk outlined the genre’s rise and fall from its beginnings in the Bronx through its Golden Age in the nineties and ended with discussion of the genre’s current state. McGuire’s talk began with a discussion of the influences of hip-hop, in which he specifically mentioned the talking blues and West African music. Due mention was also given to the influence of poetry on the genre, and with nods to Gil Scott Heron and the Last Poets, McGuire detailed how these influences mixed in the Bronx. To set the scene, he talked about Robert Moses’ push for urban renewal by the city of New York in 1972, which saw massive construction projects in the Bronx. The Cross Bronx Expressway displaced millions in an effort to make the city more accessible to the suburbs. The result: property values plummeted, half a million jobs were lost, and youth unemployment spiked to eighty per cent. Four blocks a week were lost to fire throughout the decade because it was more profitable for landlords to lose their property and collect insurance than to maintain it. It was a place where people had to make their own fun, giving rise to many hip-hop related activities. Together these allowed the community to come together around music by converging in parks, stealing power, and putting on massive shows. After adding the caveat that this was only a history, and not the history, of hip-hop, he outlined the first advancements of hip-hop in the field of DJing. From DJ Kool Herc’s stringing the break beats of songs together to Grandmaster Flash’s clocking technique, the sound developed over the course of twenty years. McGuire discussed how, unlike preceding genres that became cultural touchstones, such as rock-‘n’-roll or jazz, hip-hop stayed largely true to itself and remained politically charged. As Chuck D famously said, “Rap is black America’s TV station. It gives a whole perspective about what exists and what black life is.”\nHowever, as rap became part of the mainstream its principle began to shift, the genre becoming more and more dominated by the themes and sounds of West Coast gangster rap. McGuire ended his talk on that note, opening up the floor for discussion. In these discussions, more controversial topics such as the direction and focus of contemporary hip-hop were brought up, including its focus on money and its attitudes toward women. McGuire is a rapper and producer himself, releasing albums and contributions to other projects under the moniker Hermitofthewoods. He is also an avid slam poet who has competed on the national stage, and a resident judge for The Elements League, which is part of a rap battle circuit. The talk was a planned part of the university’s celebration of Black History Month, some of which is now occurring during the month of March due to complications arising as a result of the strike.\n\nQ.

It’s very difficult to hold your head up with dignity when guys are looking at you like you just some b*tch or a hoe. It’s not exactly a fun kind of subculture for the women. It’s all good for the men that get to be machismo and posture and strut about, that’s all good.

The History of Hip-Hop and Rap\nTranscript of The History of Hip-Hop and Rap\nRap starts getting more popular and spreading around the U.S. when its irresistible tune gets stuck in peoples heads and they just can't get enough. The Golden Era of Rap began in 1984 when most of the rappers were popular enough to go on tour. From 1986 to 1989 the rap business grows quickly, spreading across the United States. As rap kept growing, adults realized there was use of explicit language and they watched it closely, not wanting it to influence children and teens. The parental concern was not enough to stop the growth of this popular culture. Rap became more popular and it created new generations of artists who became businessmen. These businessmen started their own record companies and had the power to sign artists and determine how much money they would make. Rap continued to gain in popularity during this Golden Era even though bad language and violence were some of its features and artists continued to dominate the music and social scenes. Hip hop artists sport golden chains, live in Hollywood mansions and make their own brand of head phones. Read on to find how they got there and how long they'll stay! Hip-hop was first born in the mid nineteen seventies around New York. It was inhabited by a large segment of lower class African-Americans and was used for entertainment when they had nothing to do. Dancing, DJing and grafetti kept these kids busy and out of trouble. Hip-hop has many different features, it is not just music. Some things hip hop covers is rap, DJing, graffiti, and even B-boying or break dancing. In New York, the hip-hop trend starts gaining momentum because new hip-hop artists are creating new hits. Rappers start producing better improved songs that send chills down your spine such as the Shugarhill Gang's hit “Rappers Delight.\" Hip-hop comes in many different forms and genres. The Roots of Hip-Hop\nHip-Hop Microphone: http:\/\/cdn8.staztic.com\/app\/a\/1042\/1042965\/hip-hop-and-rap-radio-android-4-2-s-307x512.jpg\nBaker, Soren. The History of Hip-Hop and Rap. Detroit: Lucent, 2006. Print. The Golden Era of Rap\nThere are many different types of rap. Once the Golden Era of rap stopped gaining momentum, a new types of rap emerged. Gangster rap, battle rap, and crunk are three of the most popular U.S. genres. This new style was called “Gangster Rap” it was a more explicit form of music. Gangster Rap has a lot of violent lyrics that make you flinch. For example, Melle Mel's song “The Message” makes you want to cover your ears because of the dirty lyrics. Recently, this type of rap has come under fire for its violent themes. Battle rap began when rappers starting to compete for hit songs. A battle rap is when one rapper insults another while making himself look good. This prompts a competition between different groups within the music industry as groups are trying to maintain popularity. Crunk began in the dance clubs and has a loud, heavy beat. These songs are high pitched and drum heavy with catchy lyrics. Crunk stands for \"crazy and drunk.\" Rap has many different genres and continues to show up in mainstream culture. In spite of its bad language and violent themes, it has shown that if artists have something good to say, people will listen. Hip-hop is now a hit around the world, everybody loves it. Even though hip-hop was born in the U.S it has now spread around the world. You will find it in places like Brazil, Cuba, New Zeland, and even as far as China.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:2a1cb40d-396f-47c7-a02e-63e6784ba574>"]},{"passage":"learn how to Supercharge your Career in the Music Industry:\nHip hop has become a powerful force in popular culture and made an indelible mark on the world. It originated as an urban African American cultural movement in the late 1960s in the South Bronx, New York where a marginalized community had little to call their own. They found a voice with hip-hop and have since gone on to influence fashion, music, film, art, and more. Hip-hop is an integral part of American pop culture, making waves in fashion, television, movies, retail sales, and literature. As such, it is a multi-billion dollar industry. The music is a multi-genre, multicultural experience that draws artists of other genres into its vortex. But hip hop’s beginnings were downright humble and anything but omnipotent. We look at the history of this now-powerful, iconic genre, starting with hip hop’s progenitors, through to its meteoric rise to dominance. You’ll learn about the four elements of hip hop and how the genre has grown throughout the decades. Battle rapping, hardcore and gangsta rap, boom bap, and more–and how all of those derivatives have their own look, lifestyle, and song topics. At the end of this course, you’ll be able to define what hip hop is, summarize the key words and symbols used in the genre, and identify differences in hip hop subgenres. The Listening Library will have you listen to three artists discussed in the course and explain why you chose them, what you learned from them, and any ideas you may have gotten from them. You’ll also watch episode six of Hip Hop Evolution, centering on Tupac and his influence on the genre. You’ll also work on a marketing plan for yourself in Market Time.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:fddfd4dc-94b5-4089-b1ce-f67f9be8af02>"]},{"passage":"(Links to an external site. )Links to an external site.Dyson, Michael Eric. 2007.

Two of my first influences outside of music were my Mom and Grandpa. My mother would always play diverse music around me from Tina Turner and Whitney Houston to New Edition and solo Bobby Brown. Doing this gave me an appreciation for different styles. Next my Grandpa would always sing around me and I can remember watching a documentary with him on Sam Cooke and how he basically was “Berry Gordy” before Berry Gordy with his discovery and production of numerous artists. One of those Artists in particular Bobby Womack is one of my music influences. His music is extremely soulful, unapologetic, and heartfelt. Next on the Hip Hop side I was influenced by 2Pac, KRS-One, Ice Cube, Busta Rhymez, and T.I. As a fan of Hip Hop, I loved the unapologetic delivery of 2Pac, KRS-One, and Ice Cube. As a person I also loved the High energy that Busta Rhymes and T.I. displayed. 7) If you could choose to collaborate with 3 other artists on the same track – who would they be? I would love to perform on Neptunes produced track with Andre 3000, Janelle Monae, and Big K.R.I.T. 8) How do you currently make money as an independent hip-hop artists? I have my own business outside of music that specializes in legal document preparation, tax services, notarial acts, and fingerprinting. 9) What are you hoping to achieve with your music? My main goal is to share an often silenced element of Hip Hop which is standing up and fighting oppression. Hip Hop was started due to oppression in the South Bronx, but that message has been muted and ignored over the years. Now in recent times it has been coming back, but it generally doesn’t sustain because it may come off as too preachy to most people. I want to make it a lifestyle instead of a trend so that people do it as naturally as breathing. 10) What do you think is the biggest barrier an artist like yourself has to overcome, to gain commercial success? One of the biggest things would be finding my own niche market. I make music about Black Empowerment, but my songs aren’t exactly along the lines of Public Enemy or A Tribe Called Quest. I make music for the person that doesn’t like racism, but may not have read a Malcolm X book or marched in a protest. A lot of my listeners like going to the club or buying Air Jordan shoes, but when you get into conversations about Black Empowerment, they are ridiculed and ignored. I want my music to be an introduction in to consciousness for that ignored audience. The biggest challenge with that is making music that they will enjoy without being judgmental also while still maintaining the same high energy and excitement of today’s music industry while staying true to myself as a person.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:7fba8d65-7225-4098-b055-04827e84a338>"]},{"passage":"Welcome to the Hip-Hop Music Research Guide!

Mike McGuire, both an artist and student of the genre, talked hip-hop last week at Mount Allison. McGuire is a recent graduate of Mount Saint Vincent University, whose time there culminated in a thesis on the history of hip-hop in Halifax; his talk outlined the genre’s rise and fall from its beginnings in the Bronx through its Golden Age in the nineties and ended with discussion of the genre’s current state. McGuire’s talk began with a discussion of the influences of hip-hop, in which he specifically mentioned the talking blues and West African music. Due mention was also given to the influence of poetry on the genre, and with nods to Gil Scott Heron and the Last Poets, McGuire detailed how these influences mixed in the Bronx. To set the scene, he talked about Robert Moses’ push for urban renewal by the city of New York in 1972, which saw massive construction projects in the Bronx. The Cross Bronx Expressway displaced millions in an effort to make the city more accessible to the suburbs. The result: property values plummeted, half a million jobs were lost, and youth unemployment spiked to eighty per cent. Four blocks a week were lost to fire throughout the decade because it was more profitable for landlords to lose their property and collect insurance than to maintain it. It was a place where people had to make their own fun, giving rise to many hip-hop related activities. Together these allowed the community to come together around music by converging in parks, stealing power, and putting on massive shows. After adding the caveat that this was only a history, and not the history, of hip-hop, he outlined the first advancements of hip-hop in the field of DJing. From DJ Kool Herc’s stringing the break beats of songs together to Grandmaster Flash’s clocking technique, the sound developed over the course of twenty years. McGuire discussed how, unlike preceding genres that became cultural touchstones, such as rock-‘n’-roll or jazz, hip-hop stayed largely true to itself and remained politically charged. As Chuck D famously said, “Rap is black America’s TV station. It gives a whole perspective about what exists and what black life is.”\nHowever, as rap became part of the mainstream its principle began to shift, the genre becoming more and more dominated by the themes and sounds of West Coast gangster rap. McGuire ended his talk on that note, opening up the floor for discussion. In these discussions, more controversial topics such as the direction and focus of contemporary hip-hop were brought up, including its focus on money and its attitudes toward women. McGuire is a rapper and producer himself, releasing albums and contributions to other projects under the moniker Hermitofthewoods. He is also an avid slam poet who has competed on the national stage, and a resident judge for The Elements League, which is part of a rap battle circuit. The talk was a planned part of the university’s celebration of Black History Month, some of which is now occurring during the month of March due to complications arising as a result of the strike.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:009a300f-7d84-48a8-8d3f-275b906526f7>"]},{"passage":"Q.

(Getting Ready to Take Some Ground) Introduction: This is week four in our series “Eight Essential Exercises for Building a Better Body.” We’ve seen our need to find our strength in the Lord. Without His strength, we can’t even complete the rest of the exercises and our relationships will suffer. We’ve seen our need to make certain that our relationships are supported by and grounded in integrity. Without that belt of truth strapped around us, we cannot stand and our relationships crumble. Last week we considered the need to access the righteousness of Christ. We need to be right with God before we can be right in our relationships with others, and the way we get right with God is we allow the righteousness of Christ to be given to us. And then we ask him to fill us, to dwell in us and actually change our character so that we are truly a righteous people. This week we need to consider our need to be actively preparing to advance. The motto of the Boy Scouts is “always be prepared.” That’s a great motto, and Paul understood the need to be prepared. When he told us to have on, or put on the shoes of readiness that result from the Gospel he we was telling us to be prepared. A man without shoes is not prepared for much. In order to be prepared for action, a soldier on the front lines will sleep with his boots on at times. Having shoes on your feet is a symbol of readiness. It means you are prepared for action. You are prepared to go somewhere. When Merita and I take the kids and leave the house, the last thing we do is get shoes on all the kids. Once all of the shoes are on, then we are ready to go. You don’t leave the house to go someplace without shoes. Having your shoes on means that you’re ready. Paul knew that the soldier in his day wore shoes that kept him prepared for action. Often when we think of the shoes worn in the Mediterranean world of the first century we think of sandals. But the sandals worn by the Roman soldier were different than the sandals worn by the every day citizen. The sandals of the Roman soldier were designed for war, not for peace. When on duty he kept his sandals on so that he would be ready for action. To be prepared for combat you need quite a different shoe than you do for going to the corner store. These were specialized sandals. They had a thick sole to protect the soldiers feet from the hot sand and from sharp rocks. They also had nails driven through the soles, giving the sandals the ability to hold firm on sandy or slippery ground. Good footing was essential in winning a war and these shoes gave the soldier the good footing he needed. He wouldn’t slip or loose ground because the spikes would bite into the earth and help him hold firm. These shoes also helped the soldier to advance. A retreating army is rarely a winning army, but an army that can advance and take ground is an army that wins wars. The shoes of the soldier are designed for taking ground, advancing, and holding that ground, standing firm.","question_category":"first turn question; Natural","question_category_desc":"the initial question of a conversation, and therefore self-contained and understandable, without any other context.; phrased in the way people typically speak, reflecting everyday language use, without formal or artificial structure.","user_category":"Expert","user_category_desc":"A specialized user with deep understanding of the corpus.","question":"What was the strategic importance of the spiked soles in Roman military footwear?","gold":"The spiked soles in Roman military footwear were strategically important because they helped soldiers maintain firm footing during battle, which was essential for winning wars. They prevented slipping on difficult terrain and enabled soldiers to both hold their ground and advance effectively, as a retreating army rarely wins wars, while an army that can advance and take ground is more likely to be victorious.","answer":"The strategic importance of spiked soles in Roman military footwear lies in their functionality and adaptability to various terrains and battlefield conditions. These spikes, also known as caligae or hobnails, served several key purposes:\n\n1. **Improved Traction**: The spikes provided better grip on different surfaces, including wet and muddy terrains, which were common in ancient battlefields. This allowed Roman soldiers to maintain their footing during marches, battles, and other military maneuvers, reducing the risk of slipping and injury.\n\n2. **Versatility**: The spiked soles were adaptable to a wide range of environments, from the hard-packed earth of Roman roads to the softer soils of the countryside. This versatility was crucial for a military force that needed to operate effectively across varied landscapes.\n\n3. **Protection**: The spikes offered some protection for the soldier's feet, particularly against sharp objects on the ground such as rocks or debris. This was important in reducing the risk of foot injuries that could incapacitate a soldier.\n\n4. **Symbolic Significance**: The hobnailed boots could have held symbolic significance, representing the strength, resilience, and preparedness of the Roman military. The presence of these spikes on the soles of their boots would have been a visible sign of their military readiness and discipline.\n\n5. **Psychological Warfare**: The sight of Roman soldiers advancing with their distinctive hobnailed boots could have been intimidating to enemies, serving as a psychological weapon that signaled the disciplined and well-equipped nature of the Roman forces.\n\nOverall, the spiked soles of Roman military footwear were a practical innovation that enhanced the mobility, safety, and effectiveness of Roman legions in a variety of combat situations, contributing to the strategic and tactical success of the Roman military.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: Le Bohec calls for more detailed studies on the ranks of the army (Chapter 6, pp. 95-117). At the higher levels of responsibilty one can trace the military careers (p. 102 for a summary chart). St. Jerome’s use of military terminology assists in the reconstruction of lesser ranks (tables on pp. 103, 105) and Le Bohec finds continuities with terminology from Republican times. Military service itself was characterized by the increased performance of policing activities. Military building activity (Chapter 7, pp. 118-130) is a field in motion for Le Bohec, one marked by new excavations and new assessments of the already known data (site list on pp. 129-130). He cautions that one must abandon ideas of a ‘tetrarchische’ camp plan and notes that individual fortifications themselves seem to decrease in square area (Abb. 48 and p. 125). The next two chapters (Chapter 8, pp. 131-151; Chapter 9, pp. 152-170) discuss various aspects of the army’s tactics. Le Bohec removes the erroneous perception of the ‘soldier-farmer’ constantly tending crops (pp. 141 ff); supplies were made available by the state and private contractors with only limited interruptions in success (p. 146). Soldiers relied increasingly on artillery (missilia, tela), in addition to their swords and lances, although it proves difficult to match found objects with the terminology in literary sources (p. 134). Military diplomacy requires a more detailed study, but an increased interest on the part of the emperor in receiving all information-gathering reports is noted. As regards actual battle, the literary sources reflect that for most Romans military matters were an unknown quantity. No detailed portrait of a specific enemy normally was presented by ancient authors and Le Bohec argues against the selective rehabilitation of individual peoples, a practice known only this century and the end of the last (pp. 157-158). Overall, the army displayed a flexibility in battle tactics, which were adapted to deal with the enemy at hand and placed importance upon Pioneerarbeit. Chapters 10 (pp. 171-184), 11 (pp. 185-22), and 12 (pp. 201-212) discuss the various aspects of strategy. Le Bohec begins by dispelling misconceptions (pp. 171-173). By investigating the ancients’ use of strategic terminology (pp. 174-177) one discovers many continuities with earlier Roman practices, particularly those of the early empire. Le Bohec sets aside the view of a ‘bewegliche Armee”. Often it is difficult to distinguish between pure fortifications, cities in which soldiers were stationed, and cities proper (p. 181). The viae militares were not military in nature. Rather the term denotes a road of greater breadth (pp.183-184). The different theaters of action are surveyed in Chapters 11 and 12, with cautious reporting about the state of our knowledge and recent scholarship. Contact between military and civilians is the topic for Chapter 13 (pp. 218-228), the soldier’s life seen as ‘ein verzerrtes Bild der Zivilgesellschaft”, a somewhat altered model drawn from the structure of civil society (p. 213). Without soldiers the Empire would have proved ungovernable, hence the importance placed on the Emperor’s verbal communications and appearances before the troops, the adlocutio, and the more ornate adventus. Some gatherings are illustrated, but pose difficulties in interpretation (p. 215 and Abb. 16). Setting aside the illusory ‘soldier-farmer’, Le Bohec discusses the various forms of payment to the military and their economic impact (p. 223 for flow chart). The Roman army, like society, gradually Christianized, the first Christians present in the force as early as 200 AD. Chapters 14 (pp. 229-242) and 15 (pp. 243-260) return to a chronological narrative. The years 364-378 represent a worsening of the military situation, but Le Bohec cautions that the Voelkerwanderung was a slower process than often perceived.\n\nThis essay has been submitted by a student. This is not an example of the work written by our professional essay writers. Why did the roman army become so important in the last century BC? “Roman success in empire building was founded on the phenomenal achievements of their army.”\nThe relationship between the military and the chief political machinations of the state has been an ever present feature of history, from the first recorded geo-political actions of the Greek state up to the modern era, meted out in modern times in the democratic fight against authoritarianism and totalitarianism. In his Histories of the Peloponnesian Wars, Thucydides, writing from the viewpoint of an Athenian naval commander, notes the organic relationship between the fortunes of the armed forces and the decision making capabilities of the political apparatus. Further on, during the early sixteenth century – at the very cusp of the advent of the modern era – Machiavelli declared that the power of any given state was in relation to the perceived power of its armed forces. Essentially, these thinkers, from ancient history to Dr. Kissinger in the present day, all concur that the threat of the use of force by a supreme military power alters forever the balance of the status quo in favour of the strongest power. It is within the context of this realist doctrine of international relations theory that the historian locates the Roman political model in the first century BC – a society in a state of flux, caught in the ambitions of the early Republican founders yet confronted by the realism of the might of the growing Roman Army. To best answer the question a linear view of Roman history must be taken, analysing chronologically the changes that beset the republican model from the dawn of the century until the Restoration as overseen by Octavian. It will be seen how the fragile roots of Roman democracy facilitated the arrival of a militarily strong style of leadership; how the republican was eventually unable to fend off the right wing advances of a group of men with military ambition matched only by their desire for political power in the Senate. After the debacle of the Roman experiment with monarchy, the ruling, educated classes implemented a political republic with power diverted to the People. This necessitated a split within the people to characterise them as either ‘active’ or ‘passive’ citizens; those active citizens with enough power and influence gradually ascended the hierarchical ladder of the Roman Republic to wield influence in a variety of ways. Yet, in contrast to the republican paradigms of the modern era, the Romans never truly disassociated themselves from the ancient Greek ethos of conquest with the inherently heroic element to history that the Homeric tradition left as its enduring legacy. The main links that the historian has to the first century BC, namely Tacitus and Suetonius, were primarily concerned with recreating the glory of ancient warriors. It is a significant point because if the arts and literature of the contemporary period were concerned with romantic ideals of conquest and valour then it comes as little surprise to learn that the prevailing attitude amongst the political elite of Rome in the first century was similarly geared towards imperial examples of force. Therefore, with the stability of Rome temporarily secured, and the threat of a return of monarchical power made obsolete, the right wing nature of ancient societies made sure that expansion abroad was high on the political agenda. “It has already become clear that in various ways Rome’s small town Republican constitution was - for all the famous ‘balance’ between the classes, stressed by the Greek historian Polybius – unfitted for imperial responsibilities. The solution which imposed itself was the autocracy of the dictators Sulla (81-79BC) and Julius Caesar (48-44BC).”\nOf these two men the key figure as to why the marriage of convenience between the military and politics took place during the first century BC is without a doubt Caesar. He was the first man to make his name and fortune within the republican and then to transfer that influence to the field of military campaigns, primarily in Western Europe. There can be no denying the fact that he was motivated by a desire to attain personal valour and, as has been highlighted in the writings of Tacitus, to recreate the glories of quasi mythical figures such as Achilles and Alexander the Great.\n\nCulture® 40 the contextual guide and internet index to western civilization the roman legion roman (753 bc-400 ad) historical essay caesar exhorts his troops (ridpath illustration) ever since julius caesar led his army into rome and made himself military dictator, roman emperors have relied on the military to.

On roman military matters, commonly referred to as de re militari, by flavius vegetius renatus is essentially a field manual focusing on roman military organization and how to field an army in a time of war vegetius discusses not only the development of the roman soldier, from recruitment to final.\n\nwonderful with so much fire and spirit, with the greatest care do they maintain their graceful carriage, the neck, being bent into a bow, so that the chin appears to lean upon the breast.’\nA writer who thus carefully describes the varieties of foreign horses, and enters into such details with each, would surely have mentioned the practice of preserving the feet of these useful creatures had it been known to him; but nowhere in his writings does he allude to it. Vegetius Renatus Flavius, who flourished towards the end of the fourth century, in the reign of the Emperor Valentine, has often been confounded with the preceding writer, and his ‘De Re Militari’ has been, by Bracy Clark and many others, ascribed to Publius Vegetius. In this much-valued and classical military treatise, there is a particular enumeration of everything pertaining to an army forge; yet there is no mention made of workmen to shoe horses, nor yet of any implement or article intended for such a purpose. For examples of the losses sustained during war through horses' feet being unprotected, we are not so well supplied as in Greek history. One marked instance, however, would appear to be shown in Polybius, when that writer informs us that the horses of Hannibal's army (b.c. 216) lost their hoofs in the marshes of Etruria: ‘Equorum etiam multis, ob longum per paludes iter, ungulæ exciderunt,’\nThat a defence for the feet of some of the larger domestic animals was in use, there can be no doubt.

(2014). Archaeological Footwear. Assen: SPA Uitgevers. I have been making and using reproductions of medieval for several years. This involves a continual process of iteration, failure, and improvement. One event I participated in which included several learning opportunities was The Battle of Hattin reenactment in 2017, hosted by Regnum Hierosolymitanum in Israel. This event took place on the location where the Army of Jerusalem mustered, the road it marched upon, and the site of the battle on the closest weekend to the 830th anniversary of the battle. The event took place over three days in the height of the Israeli summer, 30June-02July. The daily high temperature was approximately 46°C (115°F) in the shade, and the distance covered was approximately 35km (22mi) over two the three days. The first day was simply for mustering, the second for marching and a skirmish, and the third for the final march and the battle at the Horns of Hattin. The first challenge I had to address was appropriate footwear for a hike over rugged terrain while carrying a load. I have been making my own footwear for reenactment purposes for several years. I decided it would be interesting to try to gauge the level of wear this sort of trek puts on them by beginning with a brand new pair. I didn’t know exactly what the terrain was going to be like before leaving, but the organizers emphasized the necessity for pattens. Pattens are a sort of sandal made of wood or stacked leather which are worn over the shoe. They add significant rigidity to the bottom of the shoes and are much easier to repair than the shoe. The problem with pattens for my specific context is that evidence of their use in the 12th century that I have been able to find is limited to a single toe strap found in London. The number of finds increases through the thirteenth century, and the largest groupings of pattens is assigned to the second half of the 14th century. (Grew p91-93) This increase in finds coincides with the development of road infrastructure, and pattens begin to decline as multi-soled shoes become popular. (Goubitz p253)\nThe justification from the event organizers for the use of pattens by the field armies of the 12th century was the existence of iron calks excavated at local sites These were essentially small iron cleats which would be affixed to the bottom of footwear at the heel, preventing excessive wear while minimally impacting traction. These were said to be in an unpublished archaeological report. The type of pattens recommended by the event coordinators was made of stacked leather, essentially multiple soles which were stitched together at the edges with a toe and heel strap. Being new to the event, I complied with their recommendations, and made the pattens pictured below. Since the 2017 event, Regnum Hierosolymitanum has changed their position on the use of stacked leather pattens being used in a late 12th century Outremer context. The earliest extant pattens in this style I have been able to find date to the 14th century. (Grew p100)\nDuring the hike, I ran into a number of problems with my pattens. On the second day, I found them to be excessively loose, collecting dirt, rocks, and sand between the sole of my shoe and the patten. I determined both the toe strap and the ankle strap needed to be tightened. During a skirmish with the Ayyubid forces, one of the pattens came off my toe and dangled behind my foot by the ankle strap, exasperating the problem. I made an impromptu repair, lashing the patten to my foot with a braided piece of palm fiber, but when we stopped for the evening I had a chance to properly repair them. There were two changes I needed to make. First, I decided to make the toe strap adjustable. I cut the toe straps in half and pierced a series of holes in the leather, through which I passed braided palm fibers and secured with knots. The more severe issue was the fit of the ankle strap. The problem was that the part of the strap passing around the back of my heel was too high.\n\n|Niccolò Mauruzi da Tolentino unseats Bernardino della Ciarda at the Battle of San Romano|\nPart 2 The Spur\nEven if our ancestors seemed to be concerned less with safety features than we are, the notion of riding a horse everyday with a total disregard for sensible riding is illogical. It is a mode of transportation with inherent risks, not a roulette wheel of conveyance. An overlooked use of a heel is that it provides a place to mount spurs. Riders attempt to move their mounts with leg pressure against the flank. Some mounts respond to this and others do not. Spurs provide an extra level of persuasion. Without going into the barbarity of the practice, a good rider uses spurs only to get the horse’s attention, not to drive steel into the side of another creature. That being said medieval spurs are long pointed prongs and I would not want to be the horse under a knight. So why did men begin to wear stacked heels in the in the 16th century? The connection to 8th through 14th century riders seems a bit spurious, no pun intended. However, a result of the transition from medieval hand weapon warfare to modern gun warfare might have included the evolution of riding tack--the stirrup, the spur and the boot. The spur has been in use in European riding for at least two millennia. Images of mounted horseman from the medieval period show heel-less or nearly heel-less riders using long stirrup straps. Two examples from the late 14th century provide a glimpse of spurs and foot placement for riders without heels. The Livre de Chasse commissioned by Gaston Fébus, Count of Foix and dedicated to Phillip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Fébus was a renowned hunter so the depiction of riding positions and the accouterments of hunters would have been of vital importance to a sportsman of his stature. The rider’s boots appear to have no heels, but do wear spurs. The other image illustrates a hunter with the standard riding position of the ball of the foot in the stirrup, but then he appears to be pacing, not pursuing. In one of the images the huntsman in pursuit of the stag is riding with at least one foot in a ‘jamming it home” stance without the aid of heels. These 14th century French noblemen for whom riding was a natural part of their existence, appear to be able to ride seriously without high-heels, but with the aid of stirrups. Although this is not an exhaustive study, these examples and other illustrations show medieval horseman riding with heel-less extended legs. The length of the leg and the geometry of the human body determine the distance covered by this arc. Due to the nature of the arc, a long strap stirrup may require a long sharp spur in order to compensate for an extended leg holding a stirrup in place rather than the effort going into the use of the spur itself. From the extant images the size of the heel, if it existed, seems to be inconsequential to the medieval rider. Part of this extension\nmay lie in the construction of medieval saddles, which brace the rider from the\nfront and back, thus giving the rider a very secure seat with the stirrups\nproviding a secondary means of balance. This longer stirrup configuration may\npartly explain the use of the long pointed spurs favored by medieval riders. With a leg in full suspension the spur needs to be longer in order to achieve\ncontact with a horse’s flank. Think of the stirrup as a weight and leg as a\npendulum shaft, any movement is limited and dependent upon contact between the\ntwo objects, leg and stirrup. The rider’s leg and foot apply pressure that\nmoves the stirrup in an arc. |Chasse, Hunting Gait|\nThe next installment will examine the heel.\n\nUnits that have been in conflict tire very quickly, and the Roman system of battle reliefs served, in this war to ensure that all the troops would be exhausted. Tired soldiers tend to panic more readily than others. Sabin confines himself to the battles of the Second Punic war, but his study of the nature of the battlefield has enormous implications for the general study of Roman imperialism. For it is through an understanding of the nature of battle that we can gain some insight into the expectations of the people who made the decisions to fight. Roman armies were designed to put immense pressure on their enemies for a short period of time, the system of battle reliefs, fatal in a drawn out battle, could be very effective in pushing a line back in the short term. A Roman consul and his army went out in search of the quick, decisive victory. This was the ideal that had emerged from warfare in Italy, reinforced by the ideology of the triumph, which celebrated precisely this kind of war. It took the experience of Hannibalic warfare to breed a different kind of general, a general who viewed a campaign as something other than the search for an opportunity to line his fellow citizens up and charge. Louis Rawlings' study of warrior societies complements Sabin's study. The Romans were used to fighting Gauls, whose habits were ideally suited to the provision of Roman triumphs. Warrior societies, as Rawlings shows, place enormous stress on personal displays of valor. Gauls delighted in challenging their opponents to single combat, and in overwhelming their enemies with a single charge. The Roman technique of battle reliefs was ideally suited to an enemy that sought victory at the first press. The result was that the Gauls tired quickly, and the Roman capacity to bring in fresh troops meant that they had little time to recover. The rate of exhaustion in a Gallic army plainly being faster than in the Roman, battles would end faster and there was no need to worry about the peripherals to the main infantry encounter. After Cannae, Maharbal is said to have told Hannibal that he knew how to win battles, but that he did not know what to do with his victory. Lazenby takes issue with this, in his thoughtful essay on Hannibal's strategy. In his view, Hannibal recognized that the war could only be won if he fought it with Rome's resources. His aim was to draw upon the manpower of Italy to defeat Rome. He was not so impractical as to think that he could destroy Rome; a point that is obvious in the terms of his treaty with Philip V (a document that deserves rather more attention than it gets here). The greater issue that emerges from Lazenby's study, just as it does from the contributions of Sabin and Rawlings is the capacity of Hannibal, and others, to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the Roman military system. The study of Hannibal's war offers an insight into the way that an intelligent contemporary \"read\" Roman society in the third century BC. By way of contrast to the First Punic War, the Second Punic war saw no decisive encounter at sea. Rankov points out that the reason for this lies in geography. In order for large fleets to operate, they need to control harbors. As a result of the first Punic war, the Carthaginians did not have access to landing spots in Sicily, and thus could not support Hannibal by sea. This is an intelligent piece of work with implications for other periods of ancient history, where control of the sea (and landing places) proved less than decisive in the absence of an enemy who was prepared to contest the point. It was only when Rome could free up resources to take advantage of its command of the sea, that sea power mattered. Anyone interested in the viability of the \"Periclean\" strategy for the Peloponnesian war ought to read this article. Rich and Cornell talk about the beginning and the end. Rich argues, with considerable conviction that the Roman attitude towards Carthage in 218 was essentially defensive, that Roman interests in Spain prior to 219 were likewise defensive, and that some Romans (e.g. Fabius) were aware of serious divisions within Carthaginian political society over the wisdom of the Barcid policy in Spain.\n\nAs a consequence of my 20+ years of genealogy research into our family’s history, I have become fascinated with how medieval people lived, including the flexibility and adaptability of the different times and cultures. Part of life was learning to live and succeed by using our own body mechanics for the best result in adapting to our environment, available materials, etc. This video is particularly fascinating as it illustrates how medieval people walked, ran and fought prior to the invention of hard soled shoes with built in heels. On impulse, I took the time to explore some of the comments and found them quite illuminating, educational or funny. And he isn’t using only the fencing manual illos as evidence, he just happened to toss that one up as an example. You see this ball-first gait and posture in illuminations, illustrations, and tapestries all over the damn place in medieval through early Renaissance artwork depicting all sorts of activities. It’s why so many figures in these look kind of dainty compared to what we might expect. Xaos Bob\nI think you’re missing an important distinction here; walking gaits vs running\/athletic gaits. Wear patterns on historical shoes (see the MoL – Shoes and Pattens chapter dedicated to this) and observation of primitive people of today suggest a normal heel to toe walking gait, just as we perform today in modern soled and heeled shoes. However, when running you do have to forefoot strike in historical shoes just as you do in modern barefoot style running shoes if you value the health of your joints. Historical people walked just like we do, but they likely ran differently than most modern people do. You can observe proper mechanics in young children. They instinctively walk heel-to-toe, but they run with a mid to forefoot strike. It’s not until years of sitting in a chair (adaptive shortening of the heel-cords, and reduced glute function etc.) and walking with modern footwear that they ‘re-train’ to heel-strike while running. Knyght Errant\nThis was quite interesting and it hit close to home. My father was an avid runner for most of his life. At different times I took up jogging to help lose weight but I struggled with it….as my time and distance was difficult to improve. I told this to my father who in turn told me a story. My father said he had read a book by a man (I don’t remember his name) who was from Europe and was a long distance runner. Long story short, he said that we should run as ancient people ran. These people ran on the balls of their feet. They never let there heels hit the ground first, even when they walked! Heel walking is not how our is designed to function. He also said conventional running shoes with the thick soles under the heel is a horrible shoe and we should run in shoes with little to no heel at all. I started ball running after that…and took about 3 days to get used to it and I bought track shoes that had no heel at all. By the end of the week I was easily running twice the distance at a faster pace. It felt like every time I had put my heel down first, I was “breaking” my forward momentum. POPPASHANGO\nSupposedly back in colonial times trackers could differentiate between Native American tracks and European tracks because of the different body mechanics. Furor Teutonicus\nYou can’t just trust the word of other reenactors and illustrations of dueling, go back to the artifacts. Check out “Shoes and Pattens” by Grew & de Neergaard or their source “Interpretation of wear marks seen in footwear” by Swallow, A W. Fighting, stalking, and other activities certainly start with a ball or toe strike, but not for normal walking. deadextra\n\nThey were used as a last resort, and the Latin expression 'ad triarios redisse', or it has come to the triarii, became a general phrase meaning that something was in a desperate situation. Cavalry - The Republican cavalry was designed for speed of movement, and were similarly equipped to the Hastati. Their general duty was to provide scouting and potential fast moving support to weakening parts of a battle line. At times the cavalry could be used to turn a flank or deliver a shock at the right moment, but their limited number generally made their capabilities limited. As the Romans were not considered great natural horsemen, the great effectiveness of cavalry in the Roman army didn't come until the inclusion of various auxilia cavalry like that of the Gauls and Germanics. Prior to the great wars against Carthage, Roman strategy, and their enemy counterparts, was relatively simple. Most battles consisted of a straight march against one another, with little though of complicating matters. As most armies were levied and used on a need basis, initial and continued training was limited. Until the Punic Wars, Rome rarely maintained any semblance of a continual standing army, and it was just too risky to attempt many complex maneuvers with inadequately trained or experienced troops. The wars with Pyrrhus of Epirus, and of course those with Carthage changed everything entirely, and the Roman battle strategies were forced to adapt. Years of brutal losses to Hannibal can be partially attributed to this fact, and of course to Hannibal's own brilliance on the battlefield. Until the rise of Scipio Africanus, there were few Roman commanders who implemented a great deal of strategy other than a straight frontal assault on an enemy position.\n\nIt is necessary for this strap to fit over the lower part of the Achilles tendon where it can ride on the widest part of your heel, rather like a belt at the waist. Between legs of the march, I completed both of these repairs. The following day I both marched and fought while wearing my pattens and had no further issues. When the march was over I took the photograph to the left. The pattens had sustained some significant wear over the three days of marching over hard packed dirt and sharp volcanic rocks. The stitches at the rear of the patten had worn away completely, making the layers partially separate, and about half of the first layer of leather had been worn through. Calks would prevent this wear, but I have not personally seen any evidence of their use in a context acceptably close to mine. Three years later, these pattens are still in working condition. I have replaced the braided palm cord with hemp, replaced the leather thongs at the instep, reinforced the holes in the ankle strap, and replaced the tread sole, but all of these repairs are very simple in comparison with maintenance on the actual shoes. The boots I wore came over the ankle and secured with a single lace which wound up the leg in four loops. I had always assumed this to simply be a matter of fashion, but I stumbled onto a possible functional reason for this system. During the march, I observed multiple people who wore low shoes stopping to pick stones out of their shoes. They complained of the problem frequently, but I never experienced so much as sand inside of my boots. When I took the boots off for the day, I found that the top edge of my boots had acted as a funnel, capturing many stones and pieces of sand, but no outside debris fell past the second loop of the leather lace. In the future, I plan on making a pair of wooden pattens in the earliest style I can find. Single soled turnshoes are not designed for walking on asphalt or gravel, surfaces that are often found at event sites. I feel that it is better to wear something may have been unusual in my period than it would be to modify them in a way that we do not have evidence for at all. The second issue I faced during the Battle of Hattin was heat. The military forces on the march were required to wear their armor, expecting to be attacked at any time. My armor consisted of a gambeson made of thirty-five layers of linen and a steel helmet. The principle problems I needed to address was wicking moisture and protecting myself from the sun. I tried out a theory with my woolen tunic. The first day I wore a wool layer between my gambeson and undertunic to determine if there was any benefit of moisture wicking, and the second I wore only my linen undertunic. It was very hot. I honestly wasn’t able to tell any difference between wearing the wool or not. In order to protect my face and neck, I wore a wide brimmed hat. The only issue I had with it was under high winds, something easily fixed by adding a braided palm chinstrap. Covering the skin in a climate like this is very important, and if you do not drink enough water it can be very dangerous. We had numerous people bow out of the trek, get treated by the embedded medic, or go to the hospital for heat related injuries and severe sunburns, but I didn’t experience any serious issues. During the march I drank approximately a liter of water per hour, something that would not have been easy to sustain in the twelfth century without an extensive system of logistics. I don’t think that there is anything else I could do to mitigate heat. My new gambeson is lighter in color and has long sleeves, so I am curious what difference there will be in that climate. I have found primary literary sources describing Byzantine troops wearing gambesons with slit armpits that can be worn behind the back, but I am wary applying this to Frankish forces. (De velitatione bellica, Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas, ca. 975)\nThe final main issue I faced during the 2017 Hattin event was water. There were three water carrying systems that I could justify with primary sources for this trek.\n\n### Question: What was the strategic importance of the spiked soles in Roman military footwear?","passages":[{"passage":"Le Bohec calls for more detailed studies on the ranks of the army (Chapter 6, pp. 95-117). At the higher levels of responsibilty one can trace the military careers (p. 102 for a summary chart). St. Jerome’s use of military terminology assists in the reconstruction of lesser ranks (tables on pp. 103, 105) and Le Bohec finds continuities with terminology from Republican times. Military service itself was characterized by the increased performance of policing activities. Military building activity (Chapter 7, pp. 118-130) is a field in motion for Le Bohec, one marked by new excavations and new assessments of the already known data (site list on pp. 129-130). He cautions that one must abandon ideas of a ‘tetrarchische’ camp plan and notes that individual fortifications themselves seem to decrease in square area (Abb. 48 and p. 125). The next two chapters (Chapter 8, pp. 131-151; Chapter 9, pp. 152-170) discuss various aspects of the army’s tactics. Le Bohec removes the erroneous perception of the ‘soldier-farmer’ constantly tending crops (pp. 141 ff); supplies were made available by the state and private contractors with only limited interruptions in success (p. 146). Soldiers relied increasingly on artillery (missilia, tela), in addition to their swords and lances, although it proves difficult to match found objects with the terminology in literary sources (p. 134). Military diplomacy requires a more detailed study, but an increased interest on the part of the emperor in receiving all information-gathering reports is noted. As regards actual battle, the literary sources reflect that for most Romans military matters were an unknown quantity. No detailed portrait of a specific enemy normally was presented by ancient authors and Le Bohec argues against the selective rehabilitation of individual peoples, a practice known only this century and the end of the last (pp. 157-158). Overall, the army displayed a flexibility in battle tactics, which were adapted to deal with the enemy at hand and placed importance upon Pioneerarbeit. Chapters 10 (pp. 171-184), 11 (pp. 185-22), and 12 (pp. 201-212) discuss the various aspects of strategy. Le Bohec begins by dispelling misconceptions (pp. 171-173). By investigating the ancients’ use of strategic terminology (pp. 174-177) one discovers many continuities with earlier Roman practices, particularly those of the early empire. Le Bohec sets aside the view of a ‘bewegliche Armee”. Often it is difficult to distinguish between pure fortifications, cities in which soldiers were stationed, and cities proper (p. 181). The viae militares were not military in nature. Rather the term denotes a road of greater breadth (pp.183-184). The different theaters of action are surveyed in Chapters 11 and 12, with cautious reporting about the state of our knowledge and recent scholarship. Contact between military and civilians is the topic for Chapter 13 (pp. 218-228), the soldier’s life seen as ‘ein verzerrtes Bild der Zivilgesellschaft”, a somewhat altered model drawn from the structure of civil society (p. 213). Without soldiers the Empire would have proved ungovernable, hence the importance placed on the Emperor’s verbal communications and appearances before the troops, the adlocutio, and the more ornate adventus. Some gatherings are illustrated, but pose difficulties in interpretation (p. 215 and Abb. 16). Setting aside the illusory ‘soldier-farmer’, Le Bohec discusses the various forms of payment to the military and their economic impact (p. 223 for flow chart). The Roman army, like society, gradually Christianized, the first Christians present in the force as early as 200 AD. Chapters 14 (pp. 229-242) and 15 (pp. 243-260) return to a chronological narrative. The years 364-378 represent a worsening of the military situation, but Le Bohec cautions that the Voelkerwanderung was a slower process than often perceived.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:32818d17-4e19-4047-b97f-5ade37102a85>"]},{"passage":"This essay has been submitted by a student. This is not an example of the work written by our professional essay writers. Why did the roman army become so important in the last century BC? “Roman success in empire building was founded on the phenomenal achievements of their army.”\nThe relationship between the military and the chief political machinations of the state has been an ever present feature of history, from the first recorded geo-political actions of the Greek state up to the modern era, meted out in modern times in the democratic fight against authoritarianism and totalitarianism. In his Histories of the Peloponnesian Wars, Thucydides, writing from the viewpoint of an Athenian naval commander, notes the organic relationship between the fortunes of the armed forces and the decision making capabilities of the political apparatus. Further on, during the early sixteenth century – at the very cusp of the advent of the modern era – Machiavelli declared that the power of any given state was in relation to the perceived power of its armed forces. Essentially, these thinkers, from ancient history to Dr. Kissinger in the present day, all concur that the threat of the use of force by a supreme military power alters forever the balance of the status quo in favour of the strongest power. It is within the context of this realist doctrine of international relations theory that the historian locates the Roman political model in the first century BC – a society in a state of flux, caught in the ambitions of the early Republican founders yet confronted by the realism of the might of the growing Roman Army. To best answer the question a linear view of Roman history must be taken, analysing chronologically the changes that beset the republican model from the dawn of the century until the Restoration as overseen by Octavian. It will be seen how the fragile roots of Roman democracy facilitated the arrival of a militarily strong style of leadership; how the republican was eventually unable to fend off the right wing advances of a group of men with military ambition matched only by their desire for political power in the Senate. After the debacle of the Roman experiment with monarchy, the ruling, educated classes implemented a political republic with power diverted to the People. This necessitated a split within the people to characterise them as either ‘active’ or ‘passive’ citizens; those active citizens with enough power and influence gradually ascended the hierarchical ladder of the Roman Republic to wield influence in a variety of ways. Yet, in contrast to the republican paradigms of the modern era, the Romans never truly disassociated themselves from the ancient Greek ethos of conquest with the inherently heroic element to history that the Homeric tradition left as its enduring legacy. The main links that the historian has to the first century BC, namely Tacitus and Suetonius, were primarily concerned with recreating the glory of ancient warriors. It is a significant point because if the arts and literature of the contemporary period were concerned with romantic ideals of conquest and valour then it comes as little surprise to learn that the prevailing attitude amongst the political elite of Rome in the first century was similarly geared towards imperial examples of force. Therefore, with the stability of Rome temporarily secured, and the threat of a return of monarchical power made obsolete, the right wing nature of ancient societies made sure that expansion abroad was high on the political agenda. “It has already become clear that in various ways Rome’s small town Republican constitution was - for all the famous ‘balance’ between the classes, stressed by the Greek historian Polybius – unfitted for imperial responsibilities. The solution which imposed itself was the autocracy of the dictators Sulla (81-79BC) and Julius Caesar (48-44BC).”\nOf these two men the key figure as to why the marriage of convenience between the military and politics took place during the first century BC is without a doubt Caesar. He was the first man to make his name and fortune within the republican and then to transfer that influence to the field of military campaigns, primarily in Western Europe. There can be no denying the fact that he was motivated by a desire to attain personal valour and, as has been highlighted in the writings of Tacitus, to recreate the glories of quasi mythical figures such as Achilles and Alexander the Great.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:71962afa-6200-47c8-86d3-bd9a1bc6700b>"]},{"passage":"Culture® 40 the contextual guide and internet index to western civilization the roman legion roman (753 bc-400 ad) historical essay caesar exhorts his troops (ridpath illustration) ever since julius caesar led his army into rome and made himself military dictator, roman emperors have relied on the military to.

One marked instance, however, would appear to be shown in Polybius, when that writer informs us that the horses of Hannibal's army (b.c. 216) lost their hoofs in the marshes of Etruria: ‘Equorum etiam multis, ob longum per paludes iter, ungulæ exciderunt,’\nThat a defence for the feet of some of the larger domestic animals was in use, there can be no doubt.

(2014). Archaeological Footwear. Assen: SPA Uitgevers. I have been making and using reproductions of medieval for several years. This involves a continual process of iteration, failure, and improvement. One event I participated in which included several learning opportunities was The Battle of Hattin reenactment in 2017, hosted by Regnum Hierosolymitanum in Israel. This event took place on the location where the Army of Jerusalem mustered, the road it marched upon, and the site of the battle on the closest weekend to the 830th anniversary of the battle. The event took place over three days in the height of the Israeli summer, 30June-02July. The daily high temperature was approximately 46°C (115°F) in the shade, and the distance covered was approximately 35km (22mi) over two the three days. The first day was simply for mustering, the second for marching and a skirmish, and the third for the final march and the battle at the Horns of Hattin. The first challenge I had to address was appropriate footwear for a hike over rugged terrain while carrying a load. I have been making my own footwear for reenactment purposes for several years. I decided it would be interesting to try to gauge the level of wear this sort of trek puts on them by beginning with a brand new pair. I didn’t know exactly what the terrain was going to be like before leaving, but the organizers emphasized the necessity for pattens. Pattens are a sort of sandal made of wood or stacked leather which are worn over the shoe. They add significant rigidity to the bottom of the shoes and are much easier to repair than the shoe. The problem with pattens for my specific context is that evidence of their use in the 12th century that I have been able to find is limited to a single toe strap found in London. The number of finds increases through the thirteenth century, and the largest groupings of pattens is assigned to the second half of the 14th century. (Grew p91-93) This increase in finds coincides with the development of road infrastructure, and pattens begin to decline as multi-soled shoes become popular. (Goubitz p253)\nThe justification from the event organizers for the use of pattens by the field armies of the 12th century was the existence of iron calks excavated at local sites These were essentially small iron cleats which would be affixed to the bottom of footwear at the heel, preventing excessive wear while minimally impacting traction. These were said to be in an unpublished archaeological report. The type of pattens recommended by the event coordinators was made of stacked leather, essentially multiple soles which were stitched together at the edges with a toe and heel strap. Being new to the event, I complied with their recommendations, and made the pattens pictured below. Since the 2017 event, Regnum Hierosolymitanum has changed their position on the use of stacked leather pattens being used in a late 12th century Outremer context. The earliest extant pattens in this style I have been able to find date to the 14th century. (Grew p100)\nDuring the hike, I ran into a number of problems with my pattens. On the second day, I found them to be excessively loose, collecting dirt, rocks, and sand between the sole of my shoe and the patten. I determined both the toe strap and the ankle strap needed to be tightened. During a skirmish with the Ayyubid forces, one of the pattens came off my toe and dangled behind my foot by the ankle strap, exasperating the problem. I made an impromptu repair, lashing the patten to my foot with a braided piece of palm fiber, but when we stopped for the evening I had a chance to properly repair them. There were two changes I needed to make. First, I decided to make the toe strap adjustable. I cut the toe straps in half and pierced a series of holes in the leather, through which I passed braided palm fibers and secured with knots. The more severe issue was the fit of the ankle strap. The problem was that the part of the strap passing around the back of my heel was too high.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:0892a90c-6a9e-4545-8695-d380d1c48776>"]},{"passage":"|Niccolò Mauruzi da Tolentino unseats Bernardino della Ciarda at the Battle of San Romano|\nPart 2 The Spur\nEven if our ancestors seemed to be concerned less with safety features than we are, the notion of riding a horse everyday with a total disregard for sensible riding is illogical. It is a mode of transportation with inherent risks, not a roulette wheel of conveyance. An overlooked use of a heel is that it provides a place to mount spurs. Riders attempt to move their mounts with leg pressure against the flank. Some mounts respond to this and others do not. Spurs provide an extra level of persuasion. Without going into the barbarity of the practice, a good rider uses spurs only to get the horse’s attention, not to drive steel into the side of another creature. That being said medieval spurs are long pointed prongs and I would not want to be the horse under a knight. So why did men begin to wear stacked heels in the in the 16th century? The connection to 8th through 14th century riders seems a bit spurious, no pun intended. However, a result of the transition from medieval hand weapon warfare to modern gun warfare might have included the evolution of riding tack--the stirrup, the spur and the boot. The spur has been in use in European riding for at least two millennia. Images of mounted horseman from the medieval period show heel-less or nearly heel-less riders using long stirrup straps. Two examples from the late 14th century provide a glimpse of spurs and foot placement for riders without heels. The Livre de Chasse commissioned by Gaston Fébus, Count of Foix and dedicated to Phillip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Fébus was a renowned hunter so the depiction of riding positions and the accouterments of hunters would have been of vital importance to a sportsman of his stature. The rider’s boots appear to have no heels, but do wear spurs. The other image illustrates a hunter with the standard riding position of the ball of the foot in the stirrup, but then he appears to be pacing, not pursuing. In one of the images the huntsman in pursuit of the stag is riding with at least one foot in a ‘jamming it home” stance without the aid of heels. These 14th century French noblemen for whom riding was a natural part of their existence, appear to be able to ride seriously without high-heels, but with the aid of stirrups. Although this is not an exhaustive study, these examples and other illustrations show medieval horseman riding with heel-less extended legs. The length of the leg and the geometry of the human body determine the distance covered by this arc. Due to the nature of the arc, a long strap stirrup may require a long sharp spur in order to compensate for an extended leg holding a stirrup in place rather than the effort going into the use of the spur itself. From the extant images the size of the heel, if it existed, seems to be inconsequential to the medieval rider. Part of this extension\nmay lie in the construction of medieval saddles, which brace the rider from the\nfront and back, thus giving the rider a very secure seat with the stirrups\nproviding a secondary means of balance. This longer stirrup configuration may\npartly explain the use of the long pointed spurs favored by medieval riders. With a leg in full suspension the spur needs to be longer in order to achieve\ncontact with a horse’s flank. Think of the stirrup as a weight and leg as a\npendulum shaft, any movement is limited and dependent upon contact between the\ntwo objects, leg and stirrup. The rider’s leg and foot apply pressure that\nmoves the stirrup in an arc. |Chasse, Hunting Gait|\nThe next installment will examine the heel.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:ee153001-ebf2-4445-909f-53d25be1db42>"]},{"passage":"Units that have been in conflict tire very quickly, and the Roman system of battle reliefs served, in this war to ensure that all the troops would be exhausted. Tired soldiers tend to panic more readily than others. Sabin confines himself to the battles of the Second Punic war, but his study of the nature of the battlefield has enormous implications for the general study of Roman imperialism. For it is through an understanding of the nature of battle that we can gain some insight into the expectations of the people who made the decisions to fight. Roman armies were designed to put immense pressure on their enemies for a short period of time, the system of battle reliefs, fatal in a drawn out battle, could be very effective in pushing a line back in the short term. A Roman consul and his army went out in search of the quick, decisive victory. This was the ideal that had emerged from warfare in Italy, reinforced by the ideology of the triumph, which celebrated precisely this kind of war. It took the experience of Hannibalic warfare to breed a different kind of general, a general who viewed a campaign as something other than the search for an opportunity to line his fellow citizens up and charge. Louis Rawlings' study of warrior societies complements Sabin's study. The Romans were used to fighting Gauls, whose habits were ideally suited to the provision of Roman triumphs. Warrior societies, as Rawlings shows, place enormous stress on personal displays of valor. Gauls delighted in challenging their opponents to single combat, and in overwhelming their enemies with a single charge. The Roman technique of battle reliefs was ideally suited to an enemy that sought victory at the first press. The result was that the Gauls tired quickly, and the Roman capacity to bring in fresh troops meant that they had little time to recover. The rate of exhaustion in a Gallic army plainly being faster than in the Roman, battles would end faster and there was no need to worry about the peripherals to the main infantry encounter. After Cannae, Maharbal is said to have told Hannibal that he knew how to win battles, but that he did not know what to do with his victory. Lazenby takes issue with this, in his thoughtful essay on Hannibal's strategy. In his view, Hannibal recognized that the war could only be won if he fought it with Rome's resources. His aim was to draw upon the manpower of Italy to defeat Rome. He was not so impractical as to think that he could destroy Rome; a point that is obvious in the terms of his treaty with Philip V (a document that deserves rather more attention than it gets here). The greater issue that emerges from Lazenby's study, just as it does from the contributions of Sabin and Rawlings is the capacity of Hannibal, and others, to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the Roman military system. The study of Hannibal's war offers an insight into the way that an intelligent contemporary \"read\" Roman society in the third century BC. By way of contrast to the First Punic War, the Second Punic war saw no decisive encounter at sea. Rankov points out that the reason for this lies in geography. In order for large fleets to operate, they need to control harbors. As a result of the first Punic war, the Carthaginians did not have access to landing spots in Sicily, and thus could not support Hannibal by sea. This is an intelligent piece of work with implications for other periods of ancient history, where control of the sea (and landing places) proved less than decisive in the absence of an enemy who was prepared to contest the point. It was only when Rome could free up resources to take advantage of its command of the sea, that sea power mattered. Anyone interested in the viability of the \"Periclean\" strategy for the Peloponnesian war ought to read this article. Rich and Cornell talk about the beginning and the end. Rich argues, with considerable conviction that the Roman attitude towards Carthage in 218 was essentially defensive, that Roman interests in Spain prior to 219 were likewise defensive, and that some Romans (e.g. Fabius) were aware of serious divisions within Carthaginian political society over the wisdom of the Barcid policy in Spain.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:4fa7a5af-51a1-4c14-af75-b36b599fb6b5>"]},{"passage":"As a consequence of my 20+ years of genealogy research into our family’s history, I have become fascinated with how medieval people lived, including the flexibility and adaptability of the different times and cultures. Part of life was learning to live and succeed by using our own body mechanics for the best result in adapting to our environment, available materials, etc. This video is particularly fascinating as it illustrates how medieval people walked, ran and fought prior to the invention of hard soled shoes with built in heels. On impulse, I took the time to explore some of the comments and found them quite illuminating, educational or funny. And he isn’t using only the fencing manual illos as evidence, he just happened to toss that one up as an example. You see this ball-first gait and posture in illuminations, illustrations, and tapestries all over the damn place in medieval through early Renaissance artwork depicting all sorts of activities. It’s why so many figures in these look kind of dainty compared to what we might expect. Xaos Bob\nI think you’re missing an important distinction here; walking gaits vs running\/athletic gaits. Wear patterns on historical shoes (see the MoL – Shoes and Pattens chapter dedicated to this) and observation of primitive people of today suggest a normal heel to toe walking gait, just as we perform today in modern soled and heeled shoes. However, when running you do have to forefoot strike in historical shoes just as you do in modern barefoot style running shoes if you value the health of your joints. Historical people walked just like we do, but they likely ran differently than most modern people do. You can observe proper mechanics in young children. They instinctively walk heel-to-toe, but they run with a mid to forefoot strike. It’s not until years of sitting in a chair (adaptive shortening of the heel-cords, and reduced glute function etc.) and walking with modern footwear that they ‘re-train’ to heel-strike while running. Knyght Errant\nThis was quite interesting and it hit close to home. My father was an avid runner for most of his life. At different times I took up jogging to help lose weight but I struggled with it….as my time and distance was difficult to improve. I told this to my father who in turn told me a story. My father said he had read a book by a man (I don’t remember his name) who was from Europe and was a long distance runner. Long story short, he said that we should run as ancient people ran. These people ran on the balls of their feet. They never let there heels hit the ground first, even when they walked! Heel walking is not how our is designed to function. He also said conventional running shoes with the thick soles under the heel is a horrible shoe and we should run in shoes with little to no heel at all. I started ball running after that…and took about 3 days to get used to it and I bought track shoes that had no heel at all. By the end of the week I was easily running twice the distance at a faster pace. It felt like every time I had put my heel down first, I was “breaking” my forward momentum.

Cavalry - The Republican cavalry was designed for speed of movement, and were similarly equipped to the Hastati. Their general duty was to provide scouting and potential fast moving support to weakening parts of a battle line. At times the cavalry could be used to turn a flank or deliver a shock at the right moment, but their limited number generally made their capabilities limited. As the Romans were not considered great natural horsemen, the great effectiveness of cavalry in the Roman army didn't come until the inclusion of various auxilia cavalry like that of the Gauls and Germanics. Prior to the great wars against Carthage, Roman strategy, and their enemy counterparts, was relatively simple. Most battles consisted of a straight march against one another, with little though of complicating matters. As most armies were levied and used on a need basis, initial and continued training was limited. Until the Punic Wars, Rome rarely maintained any semblance of a continual standing army, and it was just too risky to attempt many complex maneuvers with inadequately trained or experienced troops. The wars with Pyrrhus of Epirus, and of course those with Carthage changed everything entirely, and the Roman battle strategies were forced to adapt. Years of brutal losses to Hannibal can be partially attributed to this fact, and of course to Hannibal's own brilliance on the battlefield. Until the rise of Scipio Africanus, there were few Roman commanders who implemented a great deal of strategy other than a straight frontal assault on an enemy position.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:5a5f8022-2369-4974-8d85-3e2314ff3de3>"]},{"passage":"It is necessary for this strap to fit over the lower part of the Achilles tendon where it can ride on the widest part of your heel, rather like a belt at the waist. Between legs of the march, I completed both of these repairs. The following day I both marched and fought while wearing my pattens and had no further issues. When the march was over I took the photograph to the left. The pattens had sustained some significant wear over the three days of marching over hard packed dirt and sharp volcanic rocks. The stitches at the rear of the patten had worn away completely, making the layers partially separate, and about half of the first layer of leather had been worn through. Calks would prevent this wear, but I have not personally seen any evidence of their use in a context acceptably close to mine. Three years later, these pattens are still in working condition. I have replaced the braided palm cord with hemp, replaced the leather thongs at the instep, reinforced the holes in the ankle strap, and replaced the tread sole, but all of these repairs are very simple in comparison with maintenance on the actual shoes. The boots I wore came over the ankle and secured with a single lace which wound up the leg in four loops. I had always assumed this to simply be a matter of fashion, but I stumbled onto a possible functional reason for this system. During the march, I observed multiple people who wore low shoes stopping to pick stones out of their shoes. They complained of the problem frequently, but I never experienced so much as sand inside of my boots. When I took the boots off for the day, I found that the top edge of my boots had acted as a funnel, capturing many stones and pieces of sand, but no outside debris fell past the second loop of the leather lace. In the future, I plan on making a pair of wooden pattens in the earliest style I can find. Single soled turnshoes are not designed for walking on asphalt or gravel, surfaces that are often found at event sites. I feel that it is better to wear something may have been unusual in my period than it would be to modify them in a way that we do not have evidence for at all. The second issue I faced during the Battle of Hattin was heat. The military forces on the march were required to wear their armor, expecting to be attacked at any time. My armor consisted of a gambeson made of thirty-five layers of linen and a steel helmet. The principle problems I needed to address was wicking moisture and protecting myself from the sun. I tried out a theory with my woolen tunic. The first day I wore a wool layer between my gambeson and undertunic to determine if there was any benefit of moisture wicking, and the second I wore only my linen undertunic. It was very hot. I honestly wasn’t able to tell any difference between wearing the wool or not. In order to protect my face and neck, I wore a wide brimmed hat. The only issue I had with it was under high winds, something easily fixed by adding a braided palm chinstrap. Covering the skin in a climate like this is very important, and if you do not drink enough water it can be very dangerous. We had numerous people bow out of the trek, get treated by the embedded medic, or go to the hospital for heat related injuries and severe sunburns, but I didn’t experience any serious issues. During the march I drank approximately a liter of water per hour, something that would not have been easy to sustain in the twelfth century without an extensive system of logistics. I don’t think that there is anything else I could do to mitigate heat. My new gambeson is lighter in color and has long sleeves, so I am curious what difference there will be in that climate. I have found primary literary sources describing Byzantine troops wearing gambesons with slit armpits that can be worn behind the back, but I am wary applying this to Frankish forces. (De velitatione bellica, Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas, ca. 975)\nThe final main issue I faced during the 2017 Hattin event was water. There were three water carrying systems that I could justify with primary sources for this trek.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:0892a90c-6a9e-4545-8695-d380d1c48776>"]}]}

It's possible that \"Likuriya\" could be a misspelling, a regional brand not known outside a specific area, or a niche wine that hasn't gained broad recognition.\n\nWithout specific information on the Likuriya red wine, I can't provide a detailed taste profile or food pairing recommendations. However, I can offer general advice on how to approach pairing red wine with food based on common characteristics of red wines.\n\nRed wines can have a wide range of flavors and aromas, including but not limited to:\n\n- Fruity notes: Raspberry, cherry, plum, blackberry, etc.\n- Floral notes: Rose, violet, jasmine, etc.\n- Earthy notes: Mushroom, tobacco, leather, etc.\n- Spicy notes: Pepper, clove, cinnamon, etc.\n- Oaky notes: Vanilla, toast, coconut, etc. (typically from aging in oak barrels)\n\nWhen pairing red wine with food, the following general guidelines can be helpful:\n\n1. **Match intensity**: Pair full-bodied, robust red wines with hearty, rich dishes like steak, lamb, or game. Lighter red wines can complement lighter dishes such as chicken, pork, or pasta with tomato sauce.\n\n2. **Balance tannins**: Tannins are astringent compounds found in red wine, often described as a drying sensation in the mouth. Tannins can be balanced by fatty foods like cheese, meat, and creamy sauces.\n\n3. **Complement flavors**: Consider pairing wines with similar flavors. For example, a red wine with spicy notes might go well with spicy dishes.\n\n4. **Contrast flavors**: Sometimes, contrasting flavors can create a harmonious pairing. Sweet wines can balance spicy foods, and acidic wines can cut through rich or fatty dishes.\n\n5. **Consider regional pairings**: Often, wines are best paired with foods from the region where the wine is produced. This is based on historical and cultural practices, and can provide a natural synergy between the wine and the cuisine.\n\nIf you have access to a specific Likuriya red wine, I would recommend tasting it and considering its characteristics to guide your pairing decisions. If it's a lesser-known brand, you might want to seek out reviews or consult with a sommelier or wine expert for personalized advice.\n\nRemember, wine pairing is subjective, and the most important thing is that you enjoy the combination.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: A successful food and wine wheel complements the sugar, acid, fruit, tannin and alcohol components that create a wine’s flavor with the fat, acid, salt or sugar composing a food’s flavor. Combinations on the wheel may pair the foods or contrast them. For instance, a meal with a rich, sweet sauce may be juxtaposed with a crisp wine or matched with a ripe, soft Chardonnay. Match foods with high fat content such a meat or dairy with a Cabernet with high tannin content. Foods with high acidity, such as seafood covered with a squeezed lemon, match well with wines of high acidity. Wines with lower acidity taste watered down and bland. If salad is to be placed on the food and wine wheel, moderate the dressing, lemon juice or vinegar to better pair with a wine. Sparkling wines should be paired with salty, fried foods. Desserts on the wheel are best paired with a wine that tastes sweeter than the desert. For this reason, a darker chocolate matches well with red wine with some sweetness. Food and wine pairings on the wheel should be matched according to texture; light foods should be matched with light wine while heavier foods are matched with heavier wines. Because Chinese food tends to be salty with strong flavors, the appropriate wine to complement this meal is a non-acetic wine. Examples include Riesling, Cabernet or Merlot. Indian food tends to be heavily spiced, so the appropriate match on the wheel is a wine without heavy oak flavors such as Merlot, Zinfandel or Syrah.\n\nToday I am speaking at the 4th annual American Wine Bloggers Conference in Charlottesville, Virginia on the topic of Wine & Food Pairing so I thought I’d let you in on some of the goods. As soon as I have a link to the video of the presentation I promise to post it here… even if I trip and make a fool of myself! Really, what I want to focus on is that there is some truth to the idea of food and wine pairings and it is not a bunch of BS or “poppycock” as some have alluded to. I am passionate about the topic of food and wine pairing and am on a mission to make the idea less intimidating to people! So here goes. Below is some very basic info on pairing food and wine touched upon in my presentation. Consider this the basic fundamentals in understanding food and wine. FOOD & WINE PAIRING\nAt its core food & wine pairing is about synergy, balance, harmony: The food should not overpower the wine, nor should the wine overpower the food. Key word: BALANCE\nElements in food and wine can complement or contrast each other. - Complimenting: taste of the food and the wine should be similar. The sauce shouldn’t be sweeter than the wine, or acid in the dish is sufficiently matched to the acid in the wine. - Contrasting flavors: sweet wine with a salty dish, or sweet wine with spicy dish. Think chocolate covered pretzels, or salted caramels. These flavors are contrasting but balance each other out. We humans detect four basic tastes: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, (and 5th, umami\/savory). Think about those flavors when working with food and wine. - The weight of a dish should be matched by the weight of the wine. Think about a rich, heavy dish with full-bodied red wine. - Medium with medium\n- Light with light. Light white fish with unoaked, light bodied white wine, or a summer salad with crisp white wine. SWEETNESS LEVEL (referring to residual sugar in wine)\n- The sweetness of a dish should be matched to or exceeded by the sweetness of the wine. - Sweet wine can go with savory food. - The acidity of the dish should be matched by the acidity in the wine. If the food is more acidic than the wine then the wine will taste “flabby”. - Wines high in acid: sauvignon blanc, pinot gris\/grigio, sangiovese, pinot noir can balance high acid dishes. Think about Chianti (sangiovese) paired with spaghetti or pizza (with tomato sauce), both are high in acid and therefore balance things out. - If a food is intense in flavor, then the wine should also be intense in flavor. You want the same intensity but not combative. - Intense wines can stand up to fuller bodied foods. - Try complex wines with simple dishes, like a simple roasted beef dish with aged, top quality red so that the wine shines. - Simpler wine with more complicated dishes like a spicy Asian dish with a simple, sweet blended white or rosé. - Think regional pairing. What do they eat where the wine comes from? Goat cheese with Sancerre. Pacific Salmon with Oregon Pinot Noir. Chianti and red sauce pasta\/pizza. - Components that interact\nAlcohol accentuates heat\nSweetness accentuates acidity\nSweetness reduces perception of sweetness\nFat and protein reduce perception of tannin (red meat & tannic cabernet sauvignon)\nSalt reduces perception of tannin (blue cheese on a steak & cabernet sauvignon)\nFOODS TO AVOID, create challenging (but not impossible!) pairings\n- Asparagus- it makes everything taste sweet due to a specific type of acid in it. - Chiles- they enhance things that should be balanced (making wines taste even more tannic, more oaky, etc). - Eggs- yolk coats the palate making it difficult to taste the wine. When in a sauce they are less intrusive. Bubbles work well for egg dishes, so will high acid whites. Folks, this is just the beginning! Stay tuned as we delve deeper into the delicious world of food and wine pairing. But more importantly, what is it that YOU want to know about pairing wine with food?\n\nThis Week’s Wine Wisdom\nHere is a wine and food pairing guide to stimulate your taste buds! Below you will find very general complementary food and wine pairing recommendations. Use them for reference, as a starting point. Wine guide for typical dishes:\n- Chicken – Chardonnay or lighter reds such as Rioja, Barbera, Grenache, Burgundy\n- Green Salad – Herby whites such as Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Blanc. - Grilled Fish – Light medium bodied whites such as Pinot Grigio, Chablis\n- Pasta (red sauce) – Chianti, Zinfandel, Pinot Blanc\n- Pasta (white sauce) – Pinot Grigio, Chardonnay, Viognier, Gavi\n- Raw or steamed shellfish – Crisp, acidic wines such as Champagne, Sauvignon Blanc\n- Steak – Full-bodied red such as Cabernet, Bordeaux\nWine guide for Asian cuisines:\n- Chinese – Riesling, Gewurztraminer, Sauvignon Blanc, and Pinot Noir\n- Indian – Zinfandel, Chardonnay\n- Japanese – Beaujolais, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling\n- Thai – Chablis, Chardonnay\nWine guide for cheese:\n- Creamy soft brie or camembert – Red Burgundy, Chardonnay, Chablis\n- Strong goat cheese –Sauvignon Blanc, Sancerre, Pouilly-Fume\n- Hard Gouda – Chianti, Dolcetto, Pinot Noir\n- Semi hard cheese – Semillon, Rioja, Sauvignon Blanc\n- Smoked cheese – Gewurztraminer, Sauternes, Shiraz\n- Strong blue cheese – Sauternes, Port, Hermitage, Madeira\nInformation provided by BetterTastingWine.com http:\/\/www.bettertastingwine.com\/pairing.html\n\nHow to Pair Wine and Food\nFocus on structure, weight, and flavor profile. You want both the food and wine to stand up nicely and not overpower one another. We recommend that you look at the dish as a whole, not just the main component or protein of the dish. At the winery, we pay close attention to the sauces, spices, and smaller items that are part of the entire plate. The end goal is to make everything sing and dance together in harmony. Below are a few tips on where to begin your epicurean journey. 3 Styles of Pairings\nComplimentary – multiple components of a dish have similar flavors to the wine. However, you still want some qualities that are different. We like to recommend that when going with the ‘complimentary’ style, acid and tannins really help liven up the pairing while accentuating the fruit without being boring. Contrast – pairing a wine with a dish that has very little or no similar components. For example, sweet and salty or spicy creamy. A wonderful pairing is Mahi Tacos with Habanero Mango Aioli paired with our Viognier. The creaminess of the wine tones down the spice of the aioli while allowing the flavors to shine. The acid cuts through the weight of the aioli keeping the dish fresh and bright. Regional – Regional matches aren’t always the perfect pairing but they do work, especially if you’re short on time. They are a great way to begin to understand more about what’s going on structurally with wine and food pairings. Ask yourself, where does this varietal originate from? A great example of a regional pairing is Paella and Tempranillo. Both originate from Spain’s Rioja region. Another classic is Barbera and Truffles. A good way to think about this is people have been making this wine and cooking this food together for hundreds of years. It WILL be good. Tips to Pair\nAcid and Fat – Nothing cuts through fat like wine with great acidity. A good glass of Sparkling or Champagne is a classic. Pairing a high acid wine with a heavy dish brings out an array of interesting flavors. Acidity in wine pairs well with fatty and sweet foods. The acidity gives the wine a ‘backbone’ to stand up to the food. Alcohol can be used to cut through fatty foods or balance a sweet dish. The high alcohol prevents the food from overpowering the wine. Fruit Characteristics – A good guide is to pair similar color fruit characteristics with a wine. For example, pair red fruits with red fruit wine qualities. Pair blue fruit with blue fruit qualities. Adding contrasting fruits often will counter balance. Bitter and Fat elevate each other and is a classic pairing. The bitterness mellows out the fat letting other qualities step forward. Bitter with bitter does not work. Fat is needed to alleviate bitterness. Fat and Creamy benefit from acid and\/or a little bit of tartness. For example, our White Wine blend with Chicken Picatta is a game changer. The wine’s acid and fruit really accentuates the flavors and seasonings of the sauce and chicken. Fatty foods need either an acidic or high alcohol wine, otherwise the fat overwhelms the wine and it tastes flabby. Salty shouldn’t compete with acidity in wine. Too much salt and acid together is not good. Spicy foods pair well with sweeter wines and more full-bodied creamy whites. An oaky, malolactic white wine and spicy Cuban dishes are excellent pairings. Sweet and Salty – Ever have chocolate covered pretzels or candied maple bacon? The salt and sweet battle each other but it ends up being a tug of war of deliciousness. A little bit of salt opens your taste bud receptors making sweet dishes (like chocolate) taste even richer or sweeter. Sweet food\/wine benefits from a little acidity. The acid helps cut through the sweet to let the flavors step forward. Very tannic wine can be balanced with a sweet food. Some tannic wines (based on flavor components) can go well with fat. Masculine, opulent, dark fruit wines with great tannic structure go phenomenally well with rich steak dishes. Wine acid and food acid need to be similar. If the wine has less acidity than the food, the wine tastes flat.\n\nIn this case, look for a large pitcher and transfer the wine energetically, so that the liquid hits against the glass and increases the aeration effect. We call this aerating wine. FOOD AND WINE PAIRING. The harmony between wine and food or, as it is often called, pairing (from the French “marriage,” meaning marriage), is an exciting field where many factors come into play: the physiochemical reactions occurring and how we perceive them through our senses, one’s personal taste, cultural backgrounds, the association of ideas, etc. When thinking about the pairing, we must consider all the sensations which both wine and food produce in us: the flavors (sour, salty, sweet, bitter), tactile and chemical sensations (texture, spiciness), temperature (which greatly changes our perception), and aromas. In general, the majority of pairings are established by association or complementariness: color (whites with white meat, reds with red meat), flavors (sweet desserts with sweet wines), sensations (fatty foods with tannic wines), aromas (smoked foods with oaky whites), or intensity (strong foods with full-bodied wines). But sometimes, contrast pairing – like blue cheese with sweet wine – can yield excellent results. Obviously, there are also foods that are difficult to pair with wine, such as those based on very bitter foods (like artichokes) or very hot and spicy (spices). Don’t think that common pairings are definitive or that there are any hard and fast rules to it. Curiosity and the pursuit of pleasure should prevail. Allow your personal preferences to lead and remember that the combination possibilities are endless. Here are some ideas, depending on the type of wine:\n– Simple young white wines: a light appetizer. – Noble varieties (Chardonnay) of young white wines: white fish, goat cheese. – Oaky Chardonnay: fatty fish (sea bream, turbot), smoked fish or meats, white meat. – Rosé wines: vegetables, pasta, rice, cured meats, soft cheeses. – Young red wines: cured meats, pâtés, medium cheeses, bluefish and even some dishes made with salt cod. – Crianza red wines: grilled meats, roasts, stews, cured cheeses. – Reserva, Gran Reserva, and Vanguardista (“cutting edge”) wines: more subtle and elaborate game dishes and stews. – Sweet wines: fruit-based desserts for lighter wines, tarts with dried fruits for denser wines.\n\nA simple approach to wine buying is to match the acidity of the wine with the acidity of the dish. That’s because you don’t want the acidity of the food to overpower the wine. Both white and red wines (depending on the darkness of the skins) can be acidic depending on how they were made (like being aged in an oak barrel versus a steel barrel). Some foods, like chicken and pork, can go with either white or red wine depending on how they’re prepared. Generally, I suggest a white wine for either, and maybe a rosé (often midway in its acidity – thus one of my favorite food wine pairs) or light red, depending on the overall flavor. As for red wines, the skins and seeds included in the pressing and fermentation release even more tannic acids and alcohols into the wines – creating the flavor and color. Remember that with red wines, the lighter the wine color, the lower the tannins. That’s what creates the spectrum, varying levels of tannins. Fatty foods like steak require heavy-tannin reds like cabernets and merlots. Meanwhile, light to moderate fatty foods like salmon or pork can pair well with a light red like a pinot or Chianti. Finally, there’s one more rule for simple pairing… Pair spice with sweet. Sweeter wines, especially whites like riesling, tend to pair better with spicier foods like Thai and Mexican. That’s because sweeter wines help coat your burning tongue (from the spiciness) with sugars. Keep in mind, lower alcohol wines, like riesling and moscato, are also gentler on your palate as you enjoy spicy foods. These are my basic rules for wine pairing:\n- Focus on your taste and what you imagine it tastes like. - Make a guess as to how many tannins are in the wine. Weigh that against how heavy and acidic your food is… lemon mango salsa grilled tuna needs a bright acidic white wine with texture and body. A heavy rib eye with gravy and potatoes needs a dark and perhaps oaked red wine. And in between, say turkey or ham deserves a heavier white wine, a crisp rosé or lighter red. - Pair spicy with sweet. To make it even easier, here’s a list I put together for the most common food and wine pairings…\n- Fish: White\n- Pork: Rosé or white\n- Chicken: White or light red\n- Beef: Red\n- Pasta: Light red, though richer pasta dishes need acidic and ageable red wines\nKeep in mind, these are general rules based on food chemistry. You may find varieties of wines that go better with your meal but appear to break these rules. An old classmate of mine from graduate school at Kellogg once wrote to tell me he’d just had my Eifrig Cabernet Sauvignon with grilled swordfish on the beach. I loved it… it’s easy to see how my reds could balance the meatier texture of swordfish. And the oil and richness of the fish was complemented by the perfectly balanced acids and heavier tannins of my cabernet. Remember… The best part of learning about wine is trying and discovering what you like! The most important thing is that the value of wine tasting lies with you, the individual taster. Spending hundreds of dollars on a “good” bottle of wine doesn’t mean you’ll enjoy it (unless it’s mine of course). The best way to experience new wines pre-coronavirus was to stop by a local wine store for free tastings – often done several times a month. In some places and states, they might still be doing this… just call the store or check its website to see when it offers an event. It’s a great way to sample wine for free and get closer to finding your ideal wine. Likewise, when I’m dining out, I always ask the wait staff what they’d recommend with my dish and then ask them to get me a sip of a couple ideas before I pick what I want.

What We’re Reading…\n- Something different: We owe Milli Vanilli an apology.\n\nPart 2: Wine -Food Pairing\nIn the previous post I discussed how wine glasses are uniquely shaped to alter the wine’s taste and aroma, therefore, changing our experience and even our enjoyment with the wine. If you haven’t read the article, you can read it here. It is definitely an informative post for those who want to learn more about wine and for those who enjoy wine. For those of you who love to entertain, this post is for you! I will discuss wine and food pairings. When wine is paired with the proper food, it adds a whole new dimension to our experience of enjoying wine. In the past, I have always thought the general rule to pairing food with wine was to match the color of the wine to that of the food. For example, I thought red wine goes with red meat (beef, pork, lamb) and white wine goes well with white meat (chicken, fish and shellfish). Simple and easy? Well, I mentioned before that there are a lot of complexity with wine. To gain harmony with your food and wine pairing, you actually want to match the acidity, sweetness and strength of flavor of the wine to the food. For a rich full bodied wine you want to pair it with rich food. Sweet wines pairs well with sweet and spicy food. And interestingly, salty food pairs well with sweet and acidic wine. If you recall, in the last post, we looked at 4 different wines made by Pacific Breeze Urban Winery in New Westminster, BC. They are the Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Cabernet Sauvignon. I have included links to Pacific Breeze catalog for those who may be interested in purchasing their wines. The one thing that stands out for me in regards to Sauvignon Blanc is its freshness. When I took a sip of this wine, the first thing I said was “It’s so refreshing!”. It has aromas of cut grass, mingled with melon, citrus and apple. Sauvignon Blanc has high level of acidity pairing well with equally acidic food such as citrus and tomato based dishes or even salad with light vinaigrette dressing. The acidity in the wine also goes well with fried foods. For our evening, we were served lemon breaded chicken with a salad containing rocket greens, shaved fennel and orange wedges. Truly refreshing! Chardonnay is known as one of France’s great white wines. There is a difference in Chardonnay that has been oaked and unoaked. When Chardonnay has been oaked, the oak is able to impart flavors of buttery and\/or creamy caramel, vanilla, toast and spice; as well, it gives a richer color to the wine. Unoaked varieties will have a more fresh fruit flavor. Some of the fruit aroma can range from citrus and stone fruits (peaches, cherries and plums) to tropical fruits (pineapple). Oaked Chardonnay also have a richer and fuller appearance than those of unoaked Chardonnay. At Pacific Breeze we tried an oaked Chardonnay style which had a hint of butterscotch. Due to its rich and buttery flavor it was paired with Risotto with petite pois and parmesan cheese. Pinot Noir is the most food friendly of the wines because it is able to complement with the widest variety of food. The body and color of Pinot Noir is lighter than the Cabernet Sauvignon. It is light but still have complexity in its flavor. It has moderate level of tannin pairing it well with richer meats such as lamb and duck. But the tannin is also soft enough to go with white meats such as salmon and chicken. It has an earthy flavor pairing well with fruits and vegetable such as mushrooms and figs. On the nose you can smell aroma of berries with earthy tones of mushroom and leather. This wine has not yet been released by Pacific Breeze, but it is wonderful! We tested our palate with goat cheese and Prosciutto wrapped figs. The last wine on our list is the Cabernet Sauvignon, a widely recognized red wine grape variety. It is a wine that is commonly blended with other varieties of wine, such as the Merlot and the Cabernet Franc, to make the Bordeaux blends.\n\nThe Basics of Pairing Food and Wine\nMatching wine with different cuisines and flavour profiles can be confusing, but to help you get it right, the Wine Selectors Tasting Panel has taken the guesswork out of the equation with their handy guide to creating complementary food and wine pairings. Balance & harmony\nWine and food should be partners, with neither dominating the other. Richer foods need a richer wine that won’t fade in comparison, while light foods need a delicate wine, so the flavours in the dish aren’t overwhelmed. You can create a good match by echoing the ingredients in your food with the characteristics in the wine, for example, asparagus with Sauvignon Blanc, a spicy Shiraz with fragrant Asian dishes, or an earthy Pinot enjoyed with anything containing mushrooms. Don’t forget that the dominant feature of a dish can sometimes be the sauce rather than the main ingredient, so use that as your guide. Some wines can suffer in the presence of chilli, but others are ideal. Lower alcohol whites like Riesling and Semillon work really well, as they have high acidity and pair well with fried dishes, and with ingredients high in salt like soy sauce. A spicy red like Shiraz is arguably the best red all-rounder with spicy Asian food – just avoid wines that are too high in alcohol or tannins, as they will accentuate any heat present. Slightly off-dry Rieslings can have a calming effect on spicy food and don’t forget the option of starting the meal with a cold beer. Tannins love fat\nTannins are the astringent structural components in wine and when the tannins are obvious, a meal with a high fat content will soften the mouth-feel and create overall harmony. Great examples are slow roasted lamb shoulder or Parmigiano Reggiano with Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant wines. Fire up the barbeque and enjoy a robust Malbec with a fatty prime rib or juicy pork sausage. Acid loves acid, salt & fat\nHigh acid wines harmonise well with the natural acidity in food, with a crisp white paired with a salad featuring a zingy vinaigrette being a good example. Acid also balances fat, so beer-battered fish & chips are best served with a zesty white like Pinot Grigio, Riesling or a Classic White Blend. White wine with white meat & red wine with red meat? There is no right or wrong, but certain varieties do have a natural affinity – think chicken and Chardonnay, or pork and Pinot, however, accompanying sauces & the cooking method may influence your ultimate choice. Add a bunch of Italian herbs and white wine to your chicken dish and you should lean towards a Pinot Grigio, or whip up a slow cooked pork ragu with tomato and olives and a Barbera would be a better choice. Balance remains the key consideration, and neither the wine nor the dish should overpower the other. And don’t forget that gutsier whites like Chardonnay, Roussanne and Viognier can have more than enough weight to pair with a dish normally associated with a red wine match. Don’t forget the fifth taste – Umami\nDiscovered in Japan, and responsible for a heightened sense of deliciousness, umami drives the flavour X-factor in foods as diverse as mushrooms, tomatoes, anchovies, hard cheese, red meat, tomato sauce and Vegemite! Chefs and home cooks are increasing the use of foods rich in umami, which makes wine matching with these foods even more exciting. Start with a match that is well proven, like duck and Pinot, then add a mushroom component to ramp up the flavour complexity. What about desserts? The main consideration with a sweet pairing is that the wine is as sweet or sweeter than the dessert, as a dessert that’s sweeter that the wine will make the wine taste dull and knock out its character. Wines with a bit of fizz like Moscato or sweeter-style Prosecco can also be wonderful with fruit-based desserts or even the classic combination of melon and prosciutto enjoyed as part of an antipasto spread.

Today you’re watching the first episode of #Askwinebyalex of 2021. I’ve got a question from Alessio of @alevalente91:\n« Alex, can you remind me of the basics of food and wine pairing? »\nAlessio, that’s such a great question! I’ve done a few posts about this topic a while ago. And I was actually thinking to do a video to refresh the information. So you’re right on time! Few things to take into account for food & wine pairings\nEveryone’s perception and taste are different\nSome people are very sensitive, others don’t. The same level of sweetness or acidity can be perceived totally differently by two persons. On top of that, we all have our own personal taste. Some people like bitterness, others don’t. Every one of us is totally different. So you might enjoy your pairings, but it may not be the case of the people around you. Food is generally responsible of bad interaction, not wine\nFood and wine have a mutual influence on each other. The goal here is to have more pleasure having food and wine together, rather than separately. And also to avoid any unfortunate pairings. Now that everything is settled, let’s dive into the basics of food and wine pairing! You’ve got to understand there are 2 elements in food that will improve wine and 2 elements that will spoil it. The 2 wine-friendly elements in food: acidity and saltiness\nI’ll start with the 2 elements that will improve the wine you’re tasting: acidity and saltiness. They increase pleasant sensations in wine: sweetness, fruitiness and body. They also decrease the unpleasant sensations in wine, like astringency, bitterness and too strong acidity. Salty meals go with basically every wine and the great thing is that they’ll enhance wine aromas. So it’s all beneficial to you! Be careful to pair acid meals with wines that are even more acidic. Otherwise, they’ll just seem flat. - Think about Champagne, Muscadet, Sauvignon Blanc, Albarino, Riesling, Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo, Pinot Noir,…\nThe 2 elements unfavourable to wine: sweetness and umami\nNow let’s talk about the 2 elements in food that will be unfavourable to wine: sweetness and umami. Not only they increase unpleasant sensations in wine: astringency, bitterness, too strong acidity, alcohol burn. But they also decrease pleasant sensations like sweetness, fruitiness and body… So as you probably guessed by now, they’re quite hard to pair with wine. But, what’s umami? It’s a taste that combines saltiness and bitterness. You’ll find it a lot in Asian food like soy sauce or miso soup, but also in asparagus, eggs, mushrooms and oysters. You need to pair sweet meals with wines that are even sweeter. This way, you’ll increase their fruitiness and balance the acidity that might be increased by the food. Meals that contain umami need to be paired with very fruity wines and, if you want a red wine, choose one that has low tannins. This way you’ll increase the fruitiness and diminish the astringent sensation of tannins. - When you have meals with umami, think about Beaujolais, unoaked Pinot Noir, or Chardonnay from Mâcon. - When you have sweet meals, go all out with a Sauternes, Barsac, Tokaji Aszu or a PX. Other consideration you can take into account\nIt can be tricky to pair spicy food with wine because the spiciness increases alcohol burn and bitterness of a wine. - Think about wines with low tannins and low alcohol. Also try to choose very fruity wines with a bit of sweetness, like Pinot Gris. Similar aromatic intensity\nI said earlier that food and wine pairings are supposed to give you more pleasure than if you were having the food, or the wine, separately. This means you also have to consider the aromatic intensity when you make your pairings! You don’t want to have one element hidden by the other one.\n\nSo try to match the aromatic intensity of both elements:\n- Low aromatic intensity meals (oysters, seashell,…) >> low aromatic intensity wines (Blanc de Blancs Champagne, Muscadet, Chenin Blanc,…)\n- Strong aromatic intensity meals (game,…) >> aromatic wines (Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah,…)\nFat and acidity\nAnother thing you can play with is fat and acidity. Fat food will tend to get heavy on your palate, whereas wine’s acidity will cut through it and refresh your palate. Creamy meals, junk food or chocolate >> acidic wines (Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Chenin Blanc,… for whites; and Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Pinot Noir,… for reds)\nRegional food & wine pairings\nThe last thing I want to tell you is that « what grows together goes together ». So consider doing regional food and wine pairings. The classic French examples are:\n- goat’s crottin from Chavignol with Sancerre or Pouilly-Fumé\n- oysters with Muscadet Sèvre-et-Maine\n- foie gras with Loupiac or Monbazillac\n- comté cheese with Vin Jaune\n- Burgundy beef stew with bourgogne Pinot Noir,…\nFinal advice: just have fun! 😉\nNow you know there are plenty of things to take into account when you pair food with wine: personal sensitivies, preferences, basic rules… But since everyone is different, some people might actually enjoy strong or unusual associations. In fact, most people will like most food with most wines. Don’t lock yourself up into the classic pairings like red wine with meat and white wine with fish… Just try new things, be adventurous and have fun! Worst case scenario: your pairing doesn’t work. So what? Now you know it doesn’t work, next time you’ll try something else! At least you tried something, instead of playing it safe and never discover anything!! Well, that’s all for today! I hope this will help you make better pairings for you and your loved ones! Now, I’d love to hear from you. What’s your favourite food and wine pairing of all time? Do you rather follow these rules or play it wild? Let me know in the comments below! Thank you so much for watching this episode and I’ll see you soon on Wine by Alex!

Combinations on the wheel may pair the foods or contrast them. For instance, a meal with a rich, sweet sauce may be juxtaposed with a crisp wine or matched with a ripe, soft Chardonnay. Match foods with high fat content such a meat or dairy with a Cabernet with high tannin content. Foods with high acidity, such as seafood covered with a squeezed lemon, match well with wines of high acidity. Wines with lower acidity taste watered down and bland. If salad is to be placed on the food and wine wheel, moderate the dressing, lemon juice or vinegar to better pair with a wine. Sparkling wines should be paired with salty, fried foods. Desserts on the wheel are best paired with a wine that tastes sweeter than the desert. For this reason, a darker chocolate matches well with red wine with some sweetness. Food and wine pairings on the wheel should be matched according to texture; light foods should be matched with light wine while heavier foods are matched with heavier wines. Because Chinese food tends to be salty with strong flavors, the appropriate wine to complement this meal is a non-acetic wine. Examples include Riesling, Cabernet or Merlot. Indian food tends to be heavily spiced, so the appropriate match on the wheel is a wine without heavy oak flavors such as Merlot, Zinfandel or Syrah.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:883dfe3e-d045-43bb-9d06-b2927964c1d2>"]},{"passage":"Today I am speaking at the 4th annual American Wine Bloggers Conference in Charlottesville, Virginia on the topic of Wine & Food Pairing so I thought I’d let you in on some of the goods. As soon as I have a link to the video of the presentation I promise to post it here… even if I trip and make a fool of myself! Really, what I want to focus on is that there is some truth to the idea of food and wine pairings and it is not a bunch of BS or “poppycock” as some have alluded to. I am passionate about the topic of food and wine pairing and am on a mission to make the idea less intimidating to people! So here goes. Below is some very basic info on pairing food and wine touched upon in my presentation. Consider this the basic fundamentals in understanding food and wine. FOOD & WINE PAIRING\nAt its core food & wine pairing is about synergy, balance, harmony: The food should not overpower the wine, nor should the wine overpower the food. Key word: BALANCE\nElements in food and wine can complement or contrast each other. - Complimenting: taste of the food and the wine should be similar. The sauce shouldn’t be sweeter than the wine, or acid in the dish is sufficiently matched to the acid in the wine. - Contrasting flavors: sweet wine with a salty dish, or sweet wine with spicy dish. Think chocolate covered pretzels, or salted caramels. These flavors are contrasting but balance each other out. We humans detect four basic tastes: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, (and 5th, umami\/savory). Think about those flavors when working with food and wine. - The weight of a dish should be matched by the weight of the wine. Think about a rich, heavy dish with full-bodied red wine. - Medium with medium\n- Light with light. Light white fish with unoaked, light bodied white wine, or a summer salad with crisp white wine. SWEETNESS LEVEL (referring to residual sugar in wine)\n- The sweetness of a dish should be matched to or exceeded by the sweetness of the wine. - Sweet wine can go with savory food. - The acidity of the dish should be matched by the acidity in the wine. If the food is more acidic than the wine then the wine will taste “flabby”. - Wines high in acid: sauvignon blanc, pinot gris\/grigio, sangiovese, pinot noir can balance high acid dishes. Think about Chianti (sangiovese) paired with spaghetti or pizza (with tomato sauce), both are high in acid and therefore balance things out. - If a food is intense in flavor, then the wine should also be intense in flavor. You want the same intensity but not combative. - Intense wines can stand up to fuller bodied foods. - Try complex wines with simple dishes, like a simple roasted beef dish with aged, top quality red so that the wine shines. - Simpler wine with more complicated dishes like a spicy Asian dish with a simple, sweet blended white or rosé. - Think regional pairing. What do they eat where the wine comes from? Goat cheese with Sancerre. Pacific Salmon with Oregon Pinot Noir. Chianti and red sauce pasta\/pizza. - Components that interact\nAlcohol accentuates heat\nSweetness accentuates acidity\nSweetness reduces perception of sweetness\nFat and protein reduce perception of tannin (red meat & tannic cabernet sauvignon)\nSalt reduces perception of tannin (blue cheese on a steak & cabernet sauvignon)\nFOODS TO AVOID, create challenging (but not impossible!) pairings\n- Asparagus- it makes everything taste sweet due to a specific type of acid in it. - Chiles- they enhance things that should be balanced (making wines taste even more tannic, more oaky, etc). - Eggs- yolk coats the palate making it difficult to taste the wine. When in a sauce they are less intrusive. Bubbles work well for egg dishes, so will high acid whites. Folks, this is just the beginning! Stay tuned as we delve deeper into the delicious world of food and wine pairing.

You want both the food and wine to stand up nicely and not overpower one another. We recommend that you look at the dish as a whole, not just the main component or protein of the dish. At the winery, we pay close attention to the sauces, spices, and smaller items that are part of the entire plate. The end goal is to make everything sing and dance together in harmony. Below are a few tips on where to begin your epicurean journey. 3 Styles of Pairings\nComplimentary – multiple components of a dish have similar flavors to the wine. However, you still want some qualities that are different. We like to recommend that when going with the ‘complimentary’ style, acid and tannins really help liven up the pairing while accentuating the fruit without being boring. Contrast – pairing a wine with a dish that has very little or no similar components. For example, sweet and salty or spicy creamy. A wonderful pairing is Mahi Tacos with Habanero Mango Aioli paired with our Viognier. The creaminess of the wine tones down the spice of the aioli while allowing the flavors to shine. The acid cuts through the weight of the aioli keeping the dish fresh and bright. Regional – Regional matches aren’t always the perfect pairing but they do work, especially if you’re short on time. They are a great way to begin to understand more about what’s going on structurally with wine and food pairings. Ask yourself, where does this varietal originate from? A great example of a regional pairing is Paella and Tempranillo. Both originate from Spain’s Rioja region. Another classic is Barbera and Truffles. A good way to think about this is people have been making this wine and cooking this food together for hundreds of years. It WILL be good. Tips to Pair\nAcid and Fat – Nothing cuts through fat like wine with great acidity. A good glass of Sparkling or Champagne is a classic. Pairing a high acid wine with a heavy dish brings out an array of interesting flavors. Acidity in wine pairs well with fatty and sweet foods. The acidity gives the wine a ‘backbone’ to stand up to the food. Alcohol can be used to cut through fatty foods or balance a sweet dish. The high alcohol prevents the food from overpowering the wine. Fruit Characteristics – A good guide is to pair similar color fruit characteristics with a wine. For example, pair red fruits with red fruit wine qualities. Pair blue fruit with blue fruit qualities. Adding contrasting fruits often will counter balance. Bitter and Fat elevate each other and is a classic pairing. The bitterness mellows out the fat letting other qualities step forward. Bitter with bitter does not work. Fat is needed to alleviate bitterness. Fat and Creamy benefit from acid and\/or a little bit of tartness. For example, our White Wine blend with Chicken Picatta is a game changer. The wine’s acid and fruit really accentuates the flavors and seasonings of the sauce and chicken. Fatty foods need either an acidic or high alcohol wine, otherwise the fat overwhelms the wine and it tastes flabby. Salty shouldn’t compete with acidity in wine. Too much salt and acid together is not good. Spicy foods pair well with sweeter wines and more full-bodied creamy whites. An oaky, malolactic white wine and spicy Cuban dishes are excellent pairings. Sweet and Salty – Ever have chocolate covered pretzels or candied maple bacon? The salt and sweet battle each other but it ends up being a tug of war of deliciousness. A little bit of salt opens your taste bud receptors making sweet dishes (like chocolate) taste even richer or sweeter. Sweet food\/wine benefits from a little acidity. The acid helps cut through the sweet to let the flavors step forward. Very tannic wine can be balanced with a sweet food. Some tannic wines (based on flavor components) can go well with fat. Masculine, opulent, dark fruit wines with great tannic structure go phenomenally well with rich steak dishes. Wine acid and food acid need to be similar. If the wine has less acidity than the food, the wine tastes flat.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:aafdea38-f3cc-4b99-8d19-29d974aeeaaf>"]},{"passage":"In this case, look for a large pitcher and transfer the wine energetically, so that the liquid hits against the glass and increases the aeration effect. We call this aerating wine. FOOD AND WINE PAIRING. The harmony between wine and food or, as it is often called, pairing (from the French “marriage,” meaning marriage), is an exciting field where many factors come into play: the physiochemical reactions occurring and how we perceive them through our senses, one’s personal taste, cultural backgrounds, the association of ideas, etc. When thinking about the pairing, we must consider all the sensations which both wine and food produce in us: the flavors (sour, salty, sweet, bitter), tactile and chemical sensations (texture, spiciness), temperature (which greatly changes our perception), and aromas. In general, the majority of pairings are established by association or complementariness: color (whites with white meat, reds with red meat), flavors (sweet desserts with sweet wines), sensations (fatty foods with tannic wines), aromas (smoked foods with oaky whites), or intensity (strong foods with full-bodied wines). But sometimes, contrast pairing – like blue cheese with sweet wine – can yield excellent results. Obviously, there are also foods that are difficult to pair with wine, such as those based on very bitter foods (like artichokes) or very hot and spicy (spices). Don’t think that common pairings are definitive or that there are any hard and fast rules to it. Curiosity and the pursuit of pleasure should prevail. Allow your personal preferences to lead and remember that the combination possibilities are endless. Here are some ideas, depending on the type of wine:\n– Simple young white wines: a light appetizer. – Noble varieties (Chardonnay) of young white wines: white fish, goat cheese. – Oaky Chardonnay: fatty fish (sea bream, turbot), smoked fish or meats, white meat. – Rosé wines: vegetables, pasta, rice, cured meats, soft cheeses. – Young red wines: cured meats, pâtés, medium cheeses, bluefish and even some dishes made with salt cod. – Crianza red wines: grilled meats, roasts, stews, cured cheeses. – Reserva, Gran Reserva, and Vanguardista (“cutting edge”) wines: more subtle and elaborate game dishes and stews. – Sweet wines: fruit-based desserts for lighter wines, tarts with dried fruits for denser wines.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:239315d6-0ba9-4bf3-90ac-f4c007653cbc>"]},{"passage":"A simple approach to wine buying is to match the acidity of the wine with the acidity of the dish. That’s because you don’t want the acidity of the food to overpower the wine. Both white and red wines (depending on the darkness of the skins) can be acidic depending on how they were made (like being aged in an oak barrel versus a steel barrel). Some foods, like chicken and pork, can go with either white or red wine depending on how they’re prepared. Generally, I suggest a white wine for either, and maybe a rosé (often midway in its acidity – thus one of my favorite food wine pairs) or light red, depending on the overall flavor. As for red wines, the skins and seeds included in the pressing and fermentation release even more tannic acids and alcohols into the wines – creating the flavor and color. Remember that with red wines, the lighter the wine color, the lower the tannins. That’s what creates the spectrum, varying levels of tannins. Fatty foods like steak require heavy-tannin reds like cabernets and merlots. Meanwhile, light to moderate fatty foods like salmon or pork can pair well with a light red like a pinot or Chianti. Finally, there’s one more rule for simple pairing… Pair spice with sweet. Sweeter wines, especially whites like riesling, tend to pair better with spicier foods like Thai and Mexican. That’s because sweeter wines help coat your burning tongue (from the spiciness) with sugars. Keep in mind, lower alcohol wines, like riesling and moscato, are also gentler on your palate as you enjoy spicy foods. These are my basic rules for wine pairing:\n- Focus on your taste and what you imagine it tastes like. - Make a guess as to how many tannins are in the wine. Weigh that against how heavy and acidic your food is… lemon mango salsa grilled tuna needs a bright acidic white wine with texture and body. A heavy rib eye with gravy and potatoes needs a dark and perhaps oaked red wine. And in between, say turkey or ham deserves a heavier white wine, a crisp rosé or lighter red. - Pair spicy with sweet. To make it even easier, here’s a list I put together for the most common food and wine pairings…\n- Fish: White\n- Pork: Rosé or white\n- Chicken: White or light red\n- Beef: Red\n- Pasta: Light red, though richer pasta dishes need acidic and ageable red wines\nKeep in mind, these are general rules based on food chemistry. You may find varieties of wines that go better with your meal but appear to break these rules. An old classmate of mine from graduate school at Kellogg once wrote to tell me he’d just had my Eifrig Cabernet Sauvignon with grilled swordfish on the beach. I loved it… it’s easy to see how my reds could balance the meatier texture of swordfish. And the oil and richness of the fish was complemented by the perfectly balanced acids and heavier tannins of my cabernet. Remember… The best part of learning about wine is trying and discovering what you like! The most important thing is that the value of wine tasting lies with you, the individual taster. Spending hundreds of dollars on a “good” bottle of wine doesn’t mean you’ll enjoy it (unless it’s mine of course). The best way to experience new wines pre-coronavirus was to stop by a local wine store for free tastings – often done several times a month. In some places and states, they might still be doing this… just call the store or check its website to see when it offers an event. It’s a great way to sample wine for free and get closer to finding your ideal wine. Likewise, when I’m dining out, I always ask the wait staff what they’d recommend with my dish and then ask them to get me a sip of a couple ideas before I pick what I want. What are you drinking with your holiday meal? Share your recommendations (and any wine questions you have) with me… [email protected].

If you haven’t read the article, you can read it here. It is definitely an informative post for those who want to learn more about wine and for those who enjoy wine. For those of you who love to entertain, this post is for you! I will discuss wine and food pairings. When wine is paired with the proper food, it adds a whole new dimension to our experience of enjoying wine. In the past, I have always thought the general rule to pairing food with wine was to match the color of the wine to that of the food. For example, I thought red wine goes with red meat (beef, pork, lamb) and white wine goes well with white meat (chicken, fish and shellfish). Simple and easy? Well, I mentioned before that there are a lot of complexity with wine. To gain harmony with your food and wine pairing, you actually want to match the acidity, sweetness and strength of flavor of the wine to the food. For a rich full bodied wine you want to pair it with rich food. Sweet wines pairs well with sweet and spicy food. And interestingly, salty food pairs well with sweet and acidic wine. If you recall, in the last post, we looked at 4 different wines made by Pacific Breeze Urban Winery in New Westminster, BC. They are the Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Cabernet Sauvignon. I have included links to Pacific Breeze catalog for those who may be interested in purchasing their wines. The one thing that stands out for me in regards to Sauvignon Blanc is its freshness. When I took a sip of this wine, the first thing I said was “It’s so refreshing!”. It has aromas of cut grass, mingled with melon, citrus and apple. Sauvignon Blanc has high level of acidity pairing well with equally acidic food such as citrus and tomato based dishes or even salad with light vinaigrette dressing. The acidity in the wine also goes well with fried foods. For our evening, we were served lemon breaded chicken with a salad containing rocket greens, shaved fennel and orange wedges. Truly refreshing! Chardonnay is known as one of France’s great white wines. There is a difference in Chardonnay that has been oaked and unoaked. When Chardonnay has been oaked, the oak is able to impart flavors of buttery and\/or creamy caramel, vanilla, toast and spice; as well, it gives a richer color to the wine. Unoaked varieties will have a more fresh fruit flavor. Some of the fruit aroma can range from citrus and stone fruits (peaches, cherries and plums) to tropical fruits (pineapple). Oaked Chardonnay also have a richer and fuller appearance than those of unoaked Chardonnay. At Pacific Breeze we tried an oaked Chardonnay style which had a hint of butterscotch. Due to its rich and buttery flavor it was paired with Risotto with petite pois and parmesan cheese. Pinot Noir is the most food friendly of the wines because it is able to complement with the widest variety of food. The body and color of Pinot Noir is lighter than the Cabernet Sauvignon. It is light but still have complexity in its flavor. It has moderate level of tannin pairing it well with richer meats such as lamb and duck. But the tannin is also soft enough to go with white meats such as salmon and chicken. It has an earthy flavor pairing well with fruits and vegetable such as mushrooms and figs. On the nose you can smell aroma of berries with earthy tones of mushroom and leather. This wine has not yet been released by Pacific Breeze, but it is wonderful! We tested our palate with goat cheese and Prosciutto wrapped figs. The last wine on our list is the Cabernet Sauvignon, a widely recognized red wine grape variety. It is a wine that is commonly blended with other varieties of wine, such as the Merlot and the Cabernet Franc, to make the Bordeaux blends.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:12e9cb6f-44cb-4688-b3bc-e639bc1ed27a>"]},{"passage":"The Basics of Pairing Food and Wine\nMatching wine with different cuisines and flavour profiles can be confusing, but to help you get it right, the Wine Selectors Tasting Panel has taken the guesswork out of the equation with their handy guide to creating complementary food and wine pairings. Balance & harmony\nWine and food should be partners, with neither dominating the other. Richer foods need a richer wine that won’t fade in comparison, while light foods need a delicate wine, so the flavours in the dish aren’t overwhelmed. You can create a good match by echoing the ingredients in your food with the characteristics in the wine, for example, asparagus with Sauvignon Blanc, a spicy Shiraz with fragrant Asian dishes, or an earthy Pinot enjoyed with anything containing mushrooms. Don’t forget that the dominant feature of a dish can sometimes be the sauce rather than the main ingredient, so use that as your guide. Some wines can suffer in the presence of chilli, but others are ideal. Lower alcohol whites like Riesling and Semillon work really well, as they have high acidity and pair well with fried dishes, and with ingredients high in salt like soy sauce. A spicy red like Shiraz is arguably the best red all-rounder with spicy Asian food – just avoid wines that are too high in alcohol or tannins, as they will accentuate any heat present. Slightly off-dry Rieslings can have a calming effect on spicy food and don’t forget the option of starting the meal with a cold beer. Tannins love fat\nTannins are the astringent structural components in wine and when the tannins are obvious, a meal with a high fat content will soften the mouth-feel and create overall harmony. Great examples are slow roasted lamb shoulder or Parmigiano Reggiano with Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant wines. Fire up the barbeque and enjoy a robust Malbec with a fatty prime rib or juicy pork sausage. Acid loves acid, salt & fat\nHigh acid wines harmonise well with the natural acidity in food, with a crisp white paired with a salad featuring a zingy vinaigrette being a good example. Acid also balances fat, so beer-battered fish & chips are best served with a zesty white like Pinot Grigio, Riesling or a Classic White Blend. White wine with white meat & red wine with red meat? There is no right or wrong, but certain varieties do have a natural affinity – think chicken and Chardonnay, or pork and Pinot, however, accompanying sauces & the cooking method may influence your ultimate choice. Add a bunch of Italian herbs and white wine to your chicken dish and you should lean towards a Pinot Grigio, or whip up a slow cooked pork ragu with tomato and olives and a Barbera would be a better choice. Balance remains the key consideration, and neither the wine nor the dish should overpower the other. And don’t forget that gutsier whites like Chardonnay, Roussanne and Viognier can have more than enough weight to pair with a dish normally associated with a red wine match. Don’t forget the fifth taste – Umami\nDiscovered in Japan, and responsible for a heightened sense of deliciousness, umami drives the flavour X-factor in foods as diverse as mushrooms, tomatoes, anchovies, hard cheese, red meat, tomato sauce and Vegemite! Chefs and home cooks are increasing the use of foods rich in umami, which makes wine matching with these foods even more exciting. Start with a match that is well proven, like duck and Pinot, then add a mushroom component to ramp up the flavour complexity. What about desserts? The main consideration with a sweet pairing is that the wine is as sweet or sweeter than the dessert, as a dessert that’s sweeter that the wine will make the wine taste dull and knock out its character. Wines with a bit of fizz like Moscato or sweeter-style Prosecco can also be wonderful with fruit-based desserts or even the classic combination of melon and prosciutto enjoyed as part of an antipasto spread.

Today you’re watching the first episode of #Askwinebyalex of 2021. I’ve got a question from Alessio of @alevalente91:\n« Alex, can you remind me of the basics of food and wine pairing? »\nAlessio, that’s such a great question! I’ve done a few posts about this topic a while ago. And I was actually thinking to do a video to refresh the information. So you’re right on time! Few things to take into account for food & wine pairings\nEveryone’s perception and taste are different\nSome people are very sensitive, others don’t. The same level of sweetness or acidity can be perceived totally differently by two persons. On top of that, we all have our own personal taste. Some people like bitterness, others don’t. Every one of us is totally different. So you might enjoy your pairings, but it may not be the case of the people around you. Food is generally responsible of bad interaction, not wine\nFood and wine have a mutual influence on each other. The goal here is to have more pleasure having food and wine together, rather than separately. And also to avoid any unfortunate pairings. Now that everything is settled, let’s dive into the basics of food and wine pairing! You’ve got to understand there are 2 elements in food that will improve wine and 2 elements that will spoil it. The 2 wine-friendly elements in food: acidity and saltiness\nI’ll start with the 2 elements that will improve the wine you’re tasting: acidity and saltiness. They increase pleasant sensations in wine: sweetness, fruitiness and body. They also decrease the unpleasant sensations in wine, like astringency, bitterness and too strong acidity. Salty meals go with basically every wine and the great thing is that they’ll enhance wine aromas. So it’s all beneficial to you! Be careful to pair acid meals with wines that are even more acidic. Otherwise, they’ll just seem flat. - Think about Champagne, Muscadet, Sauvignon Blanc, Albarino, Riesling, Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo, Pinot Noir,…\nThe 2 elements unfavourable to wine: sweetness and umami\nNow let’s talk about the 2 elements in food that will be unfavourable to wine: sweetness and umami. Not only they increase unpleasant sensations in wine: astringency, bitterness, too strong acidity, alcohol burn. But they also decrease pleasant sensations like sweetness, fruitiness and body… So as you probably guessed by now, they’re quite hard to pair with wine. But, what’s umami? It’s a taste that combines saltiness and bitterness. You’ll find it a lot in Asian food like soy sauce or miso soup, but also in asparagus, eggs, mushrooms and oysters. You need to pair sweet meals with wines that are even sweeter. This way, you’ll increase their fruitiness and balance the acidity that might be increased by the food. Meals that contain umami need to be paired with very fruity wines and, if you want a red wine, choose one that has low tannins. This way you’ll increase the fruitiness and diminish the astringent sensation of tannins. - When you have meals with umami, think about Beaujolais, unoaked Pinot Noir, or Chardonnay from Mâcon. - When you have sweet meals, go all out with a Sauternes, Barsac, Tokaji Aszu or a PX. Other consideration you can take into account\nIt can be tricky to pair spicy food with wine because the spiciness increases alcohol burn and bitterness of a wine. - Think about wines with low tannins and low alcohol. Also try to choose very fruity wines with a bit of sweetness, like Pinot Gris. Similar aromatic intensity\nI said earlier that food and wine pairings are supposed to give you more pleasure than if you were having the food, or the wine, separately. This means you also have to consider the aromatic intensity when you make your pairings! You don’t want to have one element hidden by the other one.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:60947fe9-3ef8-45b3-b03a-ecf8977520eb>"]},{"passage":"So try to match the aromatic intensity of both elements:\n- Low aromatic intensity meals (oysters, seashell,…) >> low aromatic intensity wines (Blanc de Blancs Champagne, Muscadet, Chenin Blanc,…)\n- Strong aromatic intensity meals (game,…) >> aromatic wines (Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah,…)\nFat and acidity\nAnother thing you can play with is fat and acidity. Fat food will tend to get heavy on your palate, whereas wine’s acidity will cut through it and refresh your palate. Creamy meals, junk food or chocolate >> acidic wines (Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Chenin Blanc,… for whites; and Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Pinot Noir,… for reds)\nRegional food & wine pairings\nThe last thing I want to tell you is that « what grows together goes together ». So consider doing regional food and wine pairings. The classic French examples are:\n- goat’s crottin from Chavignol with Sancerre or Pouilly-Fumé\n- oysters with Muscadet Sèvre-et-Maine\n- foie gras with Loupiac or Monbazillac\n- comté cheese with Vin Jaune\n- Burgundy beef stew with bourgogne Pinot Noir,…\nFinal advice: just have fun! 😉\nNow you know there are plenty of things to take into account when you pair food with wine: personal sensitivies, preferences, basic rules… But since everyone is different, some people might actually enjoy strong or unusual associations. In fact, most people will like most food with most wines. Don’t lock yourself up into the classic pairings like red wine with meat and white wine with fish… Just try new things, be adventurous and have fun! Worst case scenario: your pairing doesn’t work. So what? Now you know it doesn’t work, next time you’ll try something else! At least you tried something, instead of playing it safe and never discover anything!! Well, that’s all for today! I hope this will help you make better pairings for you and your loved ones! Now, I’d love to hear from you. What’s your favourite food and wine pairing of all time?

So, let’s take your English to the next level with some native-like ways to describe your musical interests. Try describing your favorite music genre more specifically with sub-genres. While it’s commonly known that there are many genres of music from pop to country, sub-genres are sub-categories within these genres that specify exactly what kind of music you’re talking about. Here are just a few examples but you can easily search online for more. New Wave Pop\nLofi Hip Hop\nUsing the time of the music’s release can help narrow down your musical interest. This is especially useful with genres like pop that can vary greatly from year to year. The type of music released by artists can also change a lot over time, so you can use different points in the career of a band or singer to describe the style of music you like. Here are some examples in sentences. I like listening to 80’s pop. I’m a big fan of early 2000’s alternative rock. Motown from the late 60’s was incredible. The early works of that band are the best. The mood and aesthetic of certain bands become a unique part of the listening experience. Some songs released by even the same artist can sound completely different from each other. Additionally, the aesthetic, or artistic image of a band can sometimes be just as important as the music. In fact, some aesthetics are so intertwined with the music, they merge to create their own sub-genre, like gothic rock. Here are some words to describe mood and aesthetic. Popularity plays a lot into describing music. For example, an important feature of enjoying pop music may be about what’s on top of the charts at the time. On the other hand, many rock music lovers prefer their favorite artists before they become popular. Here are some ways to describe the popularity of your favorite music. Many of these expressions can also be used when talking about movies, books, video games, and other interests. whatever– expresses openness to acceptance\nI usually like whatever’s on the radio. trending– currently popular\nThis group is trending online. indie– independent; not belonging to a major company\nI love this indie band. You probably haven’t heard of them. sell out– become too popular to be relatable\nI used to like that singer before they sold out. These are just a few examples of words and phrases to describe music, but there is much more available. Keep in mind that sub-genres, popularity, and other aspects of music help describe your musical interests more specifically. Combine these tips and describe your musical tastes like a native speaker with ease.\n\nSpotify, SoundCloud, and music blogs like Pitchfork are great places to dig in and discover new music.

Nevertheless, much pop and rock music has been very similar in sound, instrumentation and even lyrical content. Erlewine, \"British Alternative Rock\", in V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S.T. , Debate surrounds which record should be considered the first rock and roll record. The Chantays scored a top ten national hit with \"Pipeline\" in 1963 and probably the best known surf tune was 1963's \"Wipe Out\", by the Surfaris, which hit number 2 and number 10 on the Billboard charts in 1965. Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political. Paradoxically, followers of rock music have often mistrusted the world of fashion, which has been seen as elevating image above substance. Post-grunge bands emulated their attitudes and music, but with a more radio-friendly commercially oriented sound. F.W. Rock is the area between the balls and the anus, of a dom or other man. As a result, it has also been seen to articulate the concerns of this group in both style and lyrics. In popular music, embracing the '70s meant both an elitist withdrawal from the messy concert and counterculture scene and a profiteering pursuit of the lowest common denominator in FM radio and album rock. The folk rock movement is usually thought to have taken off with The Byrds' recording of Dylan's \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" which topped the charts in 1965. Rock music also drew strongly from a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical, and other musical styles. Many heartland rock artists continue to record today with critical and commercial success, most notably Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, and John Mellencamp, although their works have become more personal and experimental and no longer fit easily into a single genre. What is rock? Some performers also enjoyed a renaissance by adopting country sounds, including: the Everly Brothers; one-time teen idol Rick Nelson who became the frontman for the Stone Canyon Band; former Monkee Mike Nesmith who formed the First National Band; and Neil Young. , The origins of 1990s pop punk can be seen in the more song-oriented bands of the 1970s punk movement like Buzzcocks and the Clash, commercially successful new wave acts such as the Jam and the Undertones, and the more hardcore-influenced elements of alternative rock in the 1980s. In relation to the gender composition of heavy metal bands, it has been said that \"[h]eavy metal performers are almost exclusively male\" \"...at least until the mid-1980s\" apart from \"...exceptions such as Girlschool\". The same movement saw the beginning of the recording careers of Californian solo artists like Ry Cooder, Bonnie Raitt and Lowell George, and influenced the work of established performers such as the Rolling Stones' Beggar's Banquet (1968) and the Beatles' Let It Be (1970). Al Hurricane Jr. also began his successful rock-infused New Mexico music recording career in the 1970s, with his 1976 rendition of \"Flor De Las Flores\". Green, along with the Bluesbreaker's rhythm section Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, formed Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac, who enjoyed some of the greatest commercial success in the genre. Rock (drug): A street name given to cocaine that has been processed from cocaine hydrochloride to a ready-to-use free base for smoking.Rather than requiring the more volatile method of processing cocaine using ether, rock cocaine (also called crack) is processed with ammonia or sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and water and heated to remove the hydrochloride, thus producing a form …  There was an emphasis on instrumental virtuosity, with Yes showcasing the skills of both guitarist Steve Howe and keyboard player Rick Wakeman, while Emerson, Lake & Palmer were a supergroup who produced some of the genre's most technically demanding work. Bands like Creed and Nickelback took post-grunge into the 21st century with considerable commercial success, abandoning most of the angst and anger of the original movement for more conventional anthems, narratives and romantic songs, and were followed in this vein by newer acts including Shinedown, Seether, 3 Doors Down and Puddle of Mudd.\n\n### Question: What genre of music is Nickel Creek known for?","passages":[{"passage":"So here are a few questions for all you eBaumers.

So, let’s take your English to the next level with some native-like ways to describe your musical interests. Try describing your favorite music genre more specifically with sub-genres. While it’s commonly known that there are many genres of music from pop to country, sub-genres are sub-categories within these genres that specify exactly what kind of music you’re talking about. Here are just a few examples but you can easily search online for more. New Wave Pop\nLofi Hip Hop\nUsing the time of the music’s release can help narrow down your musical interest. This is especially useful with genres like pop that can vary greatly from year to year. The type of music released by artists can also change a lot over time, so you can use different points in the career of a band or singer to describe the style of music you like. Here are some examples in sentences. I like listening to 80’s pop. I’m a big fan of early 2000’s alternative rock. Motown from the late 60’s was incredible. The early works of that band are the best. The mood and aesthetic of certain bands become a unique part of the listening experience. Some songs released by even the same artist can sound completely different from each other. Additionally, the aesthetic, or artistic image of a band can sometimes be just as important as the music. In fact, some aesthetics are so intertwined with the music, they merge to create their own sub-genre, like gothic rock. Here are some words to describe mood and aesthetic. Popularity plays a lot into describing music. For example, an important feature of enjoying pop music may be about what’s on top of the charts at the time. On the other hand, many rock music lovers prefer their favorite artists before they become popular. Here are some ways to describe the popularity of your favorite music. Many of these expressions can also be used when talking about movies, books, video games, and other interests. whatever– expresses openness to acceptance\nI usually like whatever’s on the radio. trending– currently popular\nThis group is trending online. indie– independent; not belonging to a major company\nI love this indie band. You probably haven’t heard of them. sell out– become too popular to be relatable\nI used to like that singer before they sold out. These are just a few examples of words and phrases to describe music, but there is much more available. Keep in mind that sub-genres, popularity, and other aspects of music help describe your musical interests more specifically. Combine these tips and describe your musical tastes like a native speaker with ease.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:01af8715-cb18-459c-8f20-ce26682c3249>"]},{"passage":"Spotify, SoundCloud, and music blogs like Pitchfork are great places to dig in and discover new music.

Local experts and traditional musicians define it as being a fusion of traditional metal with other musical genres usually seen as Western Classical, Metal, badass, and folk. If you have never heard the term Folk Metal, it typically describes a type of heavy metal music that has a distinctly traditional country-influenced sound. คลิปโป๊เอเชีย They are traditional heavy metal that is heavily influenced by traditional folk music, but may also incorporate other influences into their metal music such as blues, rock, hard rock, and psychedelic. Some bands that exhibit folk metal musical characteristics include:\n• Iron and Wine John Mayer\n• Flamberizer – Rob Halford (lead guitarist)\n• Riddling Winery – Kirk Hammet (guitarist)\n• The Skinny – Melodic Thing\n• Indie\/onal – Will Anderson (co-founder)\n• Readers Tower – John Patitucci\n• The Silent Howl – Seattle based combo featuring Winny and Nick\n• A number of groups and musicians have become discouraged with the current state of the music industry and have left the band. Many artists have left or seen their last run as a band. This is because a number of people have become doubtful of the change in the music industry. They are:\n• f snakes\n• backward strung out\n• tone deaf\n• ways too afraid to adapt\n• mates too lazy to adapt\n• having nothing to contribute. Five exiting factors that need to impact music education\n• First thing is the genre. Choose the style of music that you like. It is not important what style that you listen to as long as you have a distinct style and taste. Focus on the bands and musicians that play this style of music and idols that inspire you to play. ช่วยตัวเอง Some starting points and inspiration from popular music may include:\n• Ozzy Osbourne – Clutching at Straws\n• Eric Clapton – Wonderful Tonight\n• Randy Rhoads – fine Wine\n• Nirvana – Radio Friendly Unit Shifter\n• Tom Petty – Learning To Fly\n• sting – Properly 101\n• The Eagles – Hotel California\n• Eric Clapton – Sunshine On Broadway\n• Jimi Hendrix – Purple Haze\n• Ricky Martin – unreal\n• Harry Connick Jr. – screaming wind\n• Frank Zappa -appa -appa\nIn addition, you may want to pick a more mature audience. This will surely encourage the kids as teenagers to play even harder. • Look for bands that can convey a sense of humor in their music. There are many musicians who play with a sense of parody. If you have ever attended a wedding or summer music camp, เสียงไทย you would find dairy milk curds and amused themselves to death. It is in the music. • For casual fans, you may want to grab a mix of local and out-of-town bands. Today, the internet has become rife with bands and musicians that span the globe. • Get online and research the bands and see if you can find bands Online. • Go to garageband.com and read the bands Interviews and Reviews. You may get a sense of what the band is about and how the band got started. • Write down the bands that you like on a list and startagles Vs. Machineheads. The band names will show up at the top of the list. • Ask friends who have been to local gigs. They will have gigs in their back yard and they will recommend other local bands. • Assemble a local band (if you can afford it). You may need to travel to jam with other prospective local bands. หนังน่าดูตลอดกาล This will develop your network inside the local music scene. • Keep your eyes and ears open for concerts, festivals, and local events. • Listen to the radio.

For example, granite is a very hard rock. Nevertheless, much pop and rock music has been very similar in sound, instrumentation and even lyrical content. Erlewine, \"British Alternative Rock\", in V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S.T. , Debate surrounds which record should be considered the first rock and roll record. The Chantays scored a top ten national hit with \"Pipeline\" in 1963 and probably the best known surf tune was 1963's \"Wipe Out\", by the Surfaris, which hit number 2 and number 10 on the Billboard charts in 1965. Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political. Paradoxically, followers of rock music have often mistrusted the world of fashion, which has been seen as elevating image above substance. Post-grunge bands emulated their attitudes and music, but with a more radio-friendly commercially oriented sound. F.W. Rock is the area between the balls and the anus, of a dom or other man. As a result, it has also been seen to articulate the concerns of this group in both style and lyrics. In popular music, embracing the '70s meant both an elitist withdrawal from the messy concert and counterculture scene and a profiteering pursuit of the lowest common denominator in FM radio and album rock. The folk rock movement is usually thought to have taken off with The Byrds' recording of Dylan's \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" which topped the charts in 1965. Rock music also drew strongly from a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical, and other musical styles. Many heartland rock artists continue to record today with critical and commercial success, most notably Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, and John Mellencamp, although their works have become more personal and experimental and no longer fit easily into a single genre. What is rock? Some performers also enjoyed a renaissance by adopting country sounds, including: the Everly Brothers; one-time teen idol Rick Nelson who became the frontman for the Stone Canyon Band; former Monkee Mike Nesmith who formed the First National Band; and Neil Young. , The origins of 1990s pop punk can be seen in the more song-oriented bands of the 1970s punk movement like Buzzcocks and the Clash, commercially successful new wave acts such as the Jam and the Undertones, and the more hardcore-influenced elements of alternative rock in the 1980s. In relation to the gender composition of heavy metal bands, it has been said that \"[h]eavy metal performers are almost exclusively male\" \"...at least until the mid-1980s\" apart from \"...exceptions such as Girlschool\". The same movement saw the beginning of the recording careers of Californian solo artists like Ry Cooder, Bonnie Raitt and Lowell George, and influenced the work of established performers such as the Rolling Stones' Beggar's Banquet (1968) and the Beatles' Let It Be (1970). Al Hurricane Jr. also began his successful rock-infused New Mexico music recording career in the 1970s, with his 1976 rendition of \"Flor De Las Flores\". Green, along with the Bluesbreaker's rhythm section Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, formed Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac, who enjoyed some of the greatest commercial success in the genre. Rock (drug): A street name given to cocaine that has been processed from cocaine hydrochloride to a ready-to-use free base for smoking.Rather than requiring the more volatile method of processing cocaine using ether, rock cocaine (also called crack) is processed with ammonia or sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and water and heated to remove the hydrochloride, thus producing a form …  There was an emphasis on instrumental virtuosity, with Yes showcasing the skills of both guitarist Steve Howe and keyboard player Rick Wakeman, while Emerson, Lake & Palmer were a supergroup who produced some of the genre's most technically demanding work. Bands like Creed and Nickelback took post-grunge into the 21st century with considerable commercial success, abandoning most of the angst and anger of the original movement for more conventional anthems, narratives and romantic songs, and were followed in this vein by newer acts including Shinedown, Seether, 3 Doors Down and Puddle of Mudd.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:a0ca484c-e522-4d83-a218-c52e236f889d>"]}]}

Here are several ways in which losing a home can impact physical and mental health:\n\n1. **Physical Health Deterioration:**\n   - **Immune System:** Stress can weaken the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to infections and illnesses.\n   - **Chronic Conditions:** For those already managing chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or asthma, the stress of losing a home can exacerbate symptoms.\n   - **Sleep Disruption:** The emotional turmoil and uncertainty that come with homelessness can lead to sleep disturbances, which are linked to various health issues, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes.\n\n2. **Nutritional Deficiencies:**\n   - Without a stable home, accessing nutritious food becomes challenging. Homelessness often leads to reliance on fast food, convenience stores, and food banks, which can result in diets low in essential nutrients.\n\n3. **Increased Risk of Injuries:**\n   - Homeless individuals are more vulnerable to injuries due to living in unsafe environments, exposure to harsh weather conditions, and increased stress levels.\n\n4. **Mental Health Issues:**\n   - **Anxiety and Depression:** The loss of a home can lead to significant anxiety and depression, which can have long-term effects on mental health.\n   - **Trauma:** Homelessness can be traumatic, leading to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental health conditions.\n   - **Social Isolation:** Lack of a stable home can lead to social isolation, further impacting mental health.\n\n5. **Chronic Stress:**\n   - The constant stress of not knowing where one will sleep each night, the lack of privacy, and the struggle to meet basic needs like hygiene can lead to chronic stress, which has widespread negative effects on health.\n\n6. **Access to Healthcare:**\n   - Homeless individuals often have limited access to healthcare services, which can delay treatment for physical and mental health issues, leading to worsening conditions.\n\n7. **Environmental Factors:**\n   - Homeless shelters and other temporary living spaces may not provide a clean or safe environment, increasing the risk of exposure to diseases and infections.\n\n8. **Substance Abuse:**\n   - Stress, lack of access to resources, and the trauma associated with homelessness can lead to substance abuse as a coping mechanism, which has severe health consequences.\n\n9. **Childhood Development:**\n   - For children experiencing homelessness, the instability and stress can have long-term impacts on their physical and mental development.\n\n10. **Aging Population:**\n    - Older adults who lose their homes face additional challenges, including increased vulnerability to health problems due to age-related conditions and limited social support networks.\n\nIn summary, the loss of a home has far-reaching implications for health, affecting both physical and mental well-being. It underscores the importance of stable housing as a fundamental component of overall health and well-being.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: We will write a custom Essay on Health and Social Impact of Poor Housing Condition specifically for you\n301 certified writers online\nIn general, many people believe that living in developed countries individuals receive an opportunity to reach the best possible benefits because these are sovereign industrialized states with advanced economy and technology. Nevertheless, this belief is not totally true, as those who do not earn much often have poor housing conditions or become homeless (Fritzell, Kangas, Hertzman, Blomgren, & Hiilamo, 2013). As a result, these people are negatively affected, and their physical, social, and emotional well-being suffer. On the basis of this information, professionals indicate that poor housing is widely associated with poor health status. Thus, many individuals who live in developed countries have poor housing conditions that provide adverse health and social influence because of increased risks to catch communicative diseases and stress. In particular, this paper will discuss physical issues, then psychological ones, and will end with a conclusion. Those citizens who have inadequate housing are more vulnerable to various diseases and have more health issues than those who have an opportunity to live in normal accommodation. For example, poor housing is often associated with polluted air because of problems with ventilation (Fitzpatrick, 2014). As a result, the condition of those people who already have respiratory issues worsens and those who are healthy become at a higher risk of having these problems (Polyzois, Polyzoi, Wells, & Koulis, 2016). Individuals often suffer from headaches and infectious diseases because they become weaker. It can be explained by the fact that these citizens are constantly under stress and because their homes are too cold. In addition to that, if many humans live in the same house, infections can easily spread so that each inhabitant can become ill (Adjei & Kyei, 2013). People also receive injuries because of the damaged housing and inadequately located things, which makes it difficult for them to remain positively approached. Cheap housing in developed countries is often overcrowded, so citizens lack privacy. People are social beings, and it is good for them to live next to each other, as they receive an opportunity to communicate, share information and resources. However, when “twenty people and more live in a three-bedroom place” no positive and advantageous environment can be created (Andersen, Wiliamson, Fernando, Redman, & Vincent, 2016, p. 9). Lacking space, they can hardly organize it, ensuring privacy and basic amenities. In this way, an opportunity to have enough sleep can hardly be obtained, and stressful situations are likely to be often faced. Moreover, it is much easier to catch a communicable disease in these conditions, especially for children who are more vulnerable and less cautious than adults (Bailie, Stevens, & McDonald, 2012). Thus, overcrowded locations make it more difficult for the population to remain healthy. Poor housing conditions can affect people’s mental health adversely, as they do not have an opportunity to be engaged in those activities that can improve their well-being. In particular, inadequate space and neighbours’ behaviour prevent individuals from having healthy diets, being physically active at home, and inviting friends and relatives to socialize with them. Poor housing does not allow families to have strong social ties, which makes them experience a lack of support (Jones-Rounds, Evans, & Braubach, 2014). Children often have no safe place to entertain, which puts parents under constant stress because of the necessity to pay much attention to the safety of their kids and the inability to have a required rest. Poor housing is often connected with depression and low self-esteem because humans spend much time thinking that they cannot afford to move to a better location because of financial problems (Jones-Rounds et al., 2014). Moreover, limited activity and inability to cook healthy food can lead to obesity, which also causes psychological issues making people depressed and frustrated because of their condition (Jones-Rounds et al., 2014). In this way, poor housing prevents individuals from living normal lives as they are often in a bad mood. Thus, it can be concluded that even those citizens who live in developed countries often have no opportunity to obtain decent housing, which affects their well-being. In the majority of cases, it happens because of the lack of finances and the inability to afford an expensive house or flat.\n\nDo you believe that your home can have an impact on your mental health? There are many driving factors in your mental state, including genetics, character, personality, and relationships. The environment in your house is one, too. Here are some points to think about. Having a clean home helps create a peaceful environment. That is good for your mental well-being because you will not have to think about clutter all over the house. It gives you a sense of tranquility, helping you rest and relax. Having a well-lit home is also welcome, particularly for people suffering from depression. It is common for them to like dark environments, which could only aggravate their loneliness. This would also only get worse if you make it a habit. Allowing natural light in your house can make you feel happier and more positive. It can lift your mood, leading you to become more productive in whatever task you have at hand, whether it is spring-cleaning the house or preparing for the property maintenance franchise opportunities a friend has offered you. It is also essential that you get a good sleep every night. And the quality of sleep that you get to enjoy is also dependent on the environment of your bedroom. Parts of the Home\nAre you living with your family or friends? If you are living with your family, make sure you have a harmonious relationship. Eat meals together, spend time watching your favorite TV series, and talk at the end of the day, every day. Make it a point to spend quality time with each other. In case you are living with friends and have a hard time adjusting, you can talk to them to sort things out. Some parts of your home, meanwhile, can remind you of a breakup, like the flooring where you used to sit with your partner. This can affect your mood. If you are too affected, right now, it might help to go on a vacation for a while. Another aspect of the house that can influence your mood and health is the paint color. Happy colors like yellow, light pink, and other pastel hues promote a positive and delightful vibe. Dark colors can evoke too much emotion. Choose wisely. Home and Mental Health\nYour housing location can do a lot for your mental health, as well. You tend to feel good when you live in a peaceful neighborhood. On the other hand, living in a neighborhood where crime is prevalent and vandalism is an ongoing thing can scare you off. You can become paranoid and fearful for your life. Lastly, the environment of the house can affect not only your mental health but physical health, too. As mentioned above, the state of the neighborhood you belong to can affect your feelings. For example, some houses have harmful chemicals or metals because they are already old. You can get serious illnesses like lead poisoning. The condition of your mind is somehow affected by the house you live in. Choose to live in a safe, welcoming, and positive area if you are prone to get affected mentally. A beautiful home, even if it is small, can help you think of good things and focus on living well. Live in a place where you can have peace of mind.\n\nHow Stress Affects Our Health\nIn modern times, stress-free living seems like a utopia. While certain stress levels are adaptive responses to circumstances and are considered normal, chronic or intense stress is a state of activation of the nervous system that is associated with several long-term illnesses. We cannot live in a state of continuous stress or else our body will send us warning signals in the form of illness, injuries, or a general feeling of being unwell. Therefore, keeping ourselves from excess stress is good for our health. What is stress and what is it for? Stress is a response that triggers in the brain when it perceives an external demand, such as a deadline for a job or a threat from a robbery from which you must run away. People, because of our capacity for imagination, can also experience stress as a result of mere thoughts, rather than actual events. “The voice of the ego constantly alters the natural state of wellness of the body. Almost every human body is under a lot of pressure and stress, not because it is threatened by some external factor, but by the internal action of the mind.”\nAcute stress, which is produced by a particular stimulus that we must solve puts our body in a state of activation. This allows us to react faster and with more energy, more focus, etc. It creates a tension that prepares us for action. However, chronic conditions make this activation permanent, causing a constant flow of stress hormones which ends up wasting our energy. Our hormones are out of balance and this ends up deteriorating our overall health. Effects of stress on health\nTo continue, we will name the main effects of this state of pressure and mental strain on our health. Although we must be clear that they are mainly generated by a confluence of factors. - Depression and anxiety: chronic stress can cause long-lasting states of depression and anxiety due to a hormonal imbalance and the waste of energy it involves. - Skin problems and hair loss: skin rashes like acne or eczema may be caused by continuous stress. Other conditions such as atopic dermatitis or psoriasis are exacerbated and worsened. Besides this, it can cause excessive hair loss, which in some cases may lead to complete baldness. - Menstrual problems: stress is closely related to hormones, whose prolonged imbalance can cause menstrual problems, from intensely painful periods to irregularities in the menstrual cycle; in severe cases menstruation may even disappear. - Digestive problems: stress alters the functioning of the digestive system. It makes digestion very difficult; the typical “nothing is sitting well with me.” It deregulates the intestinal transit and is also closely related to the onset of stomach ulcers because it increases the production of digestive acids that enhance these problems. - Sleep problems: as we’ve all experienced at some point, stressful situations prevent sleep or make us wake up in the middle of the night without being able to go back to sleep. Problems with insomnia are not only negative themselves, but they pose extra wear and tear because the inability to sleep well affects the performance of all tasks during daytime hours. - Arterial and heart problems: pressure and prolonged mental fatigue is related to serious diseases such as hypertension and coronary heart disease; although these effects are long term, they are really serious and should show us how necessary it is to reduce stress. - Weight problems: often stressful states encourage us to eat compulsively, which adds to the brain failing to correctly perceive the signs that we are satisfied. That is why stress is related to obesity and even diabetes. What can you do to reduce stress\nDepending on the situation that generates it and the tendency for anxiety of each person, stress can be very difficult to eradicate completely. However, there are always things we can do to reduce it as much as we can. - Doing sports is a great ally against stress. Practicing any sport lowers tension and releases energy that would otherwise remain within us and erode our resources. The simple act of walking two or three times a week will make a big difference, although doing a more intense sport will be more effective. - Another one of the most important aspects to consider when dealing with stress is diet. A healthy and balanced diet, especially rich in omega 3 fatty acids (like those found in fish), helps reduce stress, as a well-nourished body is a better regulated body. - The practice of relaxing activities such as mindfulness, meditation, yoga or psychological relaxation techniques are very beneficial to minimize stress. Sometimes finding time for yourself, taking a swim, walking … makes a difference.\n\nThere are many sources of stress in life, some overt, some less obvious. One type of stress that doesn’t get a lot of attention but has a big effect on our health is the stress associated with our environment. Some environments are very low stress – like getting out in nature. Other environments, like a loud, noisy industrial factory, wear on us much differently. If you’re trying to live a healthy life, you need to consider all the inputs, including how your environment affects you. Here, we’ll take a look at environmental stress and its effects. What Is Environmental Stress? Environmental stressors cause both short- and long-term health impacts on the body and mind. Environmental stress refers to how people or animals respond to physical, chemical and biological features of their environment. These stressors may include exposure to natural disasters, electromagnetic radiation, pollution, climate change, or noise. They can be pathogens that invade the body, causing a stress response, or features of your workplace like an uncomfortable chair. Whether one-time or long-term, environmental stressors cause strain on the body and mind. The response of the body ranges from a short-term fight-or-flight response to long-term changes to your health. A Brief History of Stress Research\nHans Selye first coined the term stress in 1950 as “the non-specific response of the body to any demand.” Since then, scientists have learned much more about stress. For animals – which we are – stressors may include predators, the availability of food, illness, or changes in the living environment. Humans face those stressors but also perceived threats, relationship issues, work concerns, and more. Environmental stress psychology focuses on how people’s mental wellness responds to physical, biological, and chemical stressors. How the Body Responds to Stress\nWhen faced with a stressor, the body reacts in predictable ways. If it’s an immediate threat – you spot a venomous snake – your body prepares itself via what scientists call the fight-or-flight response. This bodily response prepares you to either fight the snake or run away. Faced with an immediate threat, your body responds with a fight-or-flight adrenaline rush. Longer-term stressors can cause more lasting health impacts. For more mundane threats, which most environmental stressors are, the body responds in more nuanced ways. This subtle stress response can be even more harmful to your health than acute threats because it comes without fanfare. You may experience an unpleasant feeling of anxiety, or you may think nothing much about the chemical factory at the end of your street, but these constant stressors have serious impacts on your health, longevity, and mental wellness. Because the stressor is constant, you may not realize the long-term effects and the importance of removing it from your life. The Body’s Response to Short-Term Stress\nDuring a fight-or-flight response, the body releases a series of catecholamine stress hormones, including norepinephrine and epinephrine. These hormones cause your body to react in several ways: your stomach gets nervous, your heart races, your breath rate increases, your palms get sweaty, and your hands shake. Acute stress can affect your emotions, reduce your problem-solving ability, and cause other short-term psychological disturbances. If the threat is severe enough, you might even lose control of your bowels. Paradoxically, exposure to some short-term stressors – also called event stressors – can help the body have a stronger immune system. In these quick, sudden threats, the body redirects “killer T-cells” to the skin, where they boost the immune response. The exception to this is when conditions triggering the body’s fight-or-flight response become a regular occurrence, such as domestic violence. The immune system responds negatively to regular short-term acute stressors. The Health Effects of Long-Term Exposure to Stress\nWe face hundreds of environmental stressors daily. Some of these everyone is exposed to, like legacy chemicals that accumulate in people’s bodies because they are omnipresent throughout the world. Others are unique to an individual’s location, like living next to a railroad track or surviving a natural disaster like Hurricane Harvey or the California wildfires.\n\nWhether it be a health crisis, job loss, death of a loved one, break up or other difficulty, we all must face and confront losses.

This week, we will tell\nabout stress and its effects on human health. Stress is a condition resulting from mental or emotional tension. Studies have shown it can reduce the body's\nability to fight disease and lead to serious health problems. Almost two-thirds of American workers say they are\nstruggling or suffering because of stress from the current economic\nrecession. That information comes from a\nrecent opinion study by the Gallup Organization. study found that almost half of American workers expressed concern about their\nability to provide for immediate family needs. Not surprisingly, many workers say they are eating or drinking too much,\nand smoking more as they attempt to deal with money issues. affects everybody, every day. Stress is how\nyour body reacts to physical, chemical, emotional or environmental\ninfluences. Some stress is unavoidable\nand may even be good for us. Stress can\nkeep our bodies and minds strong. It\ngives us the push we need to deal with an urgent situation. But too much stress can be harmful. It may make an existing health problem worse. Or it can lead to sickness if a person is at\nrisk for the condition. example, your body reacts to stressful situations by raising your blood\npressure and making your heart work harder. This is dangerous if you already have heart disease or high blood\npressure. Stress is more likely to be\nharmful if you feel helpless to deal with the problem or situation that causes\nAnything you see as a problem can cause stress. It can result from everyday situations or major\nproblems. Stress results when something\ncauses your body to act as if it were being attacked. Causes of stress can be physical, such as injury or\ndisease. Or they can be mental, such as\nproblems involving your family, job, health or finances. Many visits to doctors are for conditions\nlinked to stress. The tension of stress can interfere with sleep or cause\nanger or sadness. A person may become\nmore forgetful or find it harder to think clearly. Losing one's sense of humor is another sign\nof an unhealthy amount of stress. can lead to other problems if people attempt to ease it by taking drugs, smoking,\ndrinking alcohol or by eating more or less than normal. lasts a long time or happens often. Chronic stress causes the body to produce too much of two hormones,\ncortisol and adrenalin. Cortisol is\ncalled the \"worry\" hormone. It is\nproduced when we are afraid. Adrenalin\nprepares the body to react physically to a threat. from chronic stress produce too much of these hormones for too long. Too much cortisol and adrenalin can result in\nphysical problems and changes that lead to stress-related sickness. provides high levels of energy during important periods. However, scientists have become concerned\nabout the hormone's long-term effects on our health. Evidence shows that extended periods of\ncortisol in the body weakens bones, damages nerve cells in the brain and\nweakens the body's defense system against disease. This makes it easier to get viral and\nChronic stress has been linked to\nhigh blood pressure and heart disease. Studies suggest that people who are easily stressed develop blockages in\nblood passageways faster than other people. High stress levels have\nbeen found to cause asthma attacks that make it difficult to breathe. Stress is also linked to mental conditions\nlike depression and anxiety disorders. Extended periods of stress have been linked to headaches, difficulty\nsleeping, stomach problems and skin disorders. also show that chronic stress reduces the levels of the hormone estrogen in\nwomen. This might put some women at\ngreater risk for heart disease or the bone-thinning disease osteoporosis. A recent study found that emotional\nstress may put some older adults at risk of falls and broken bones. Swedish researchers studied one hundred\nthirty-seven older adults who suffered bone fractures after falling. The patients were questioned at two hospitals. study found that the patients' risk of suffering a fall was higher for up to\none hour after emotional stress. Sadness\nincreased the risk nearly six percent compared to periods with no such\nfeelings. For anger, there was an\nincreased risk of more than twelve percent. And, stress increased the risk of falling by about twenty percent. and health experts believe personality is an important part in how we\nexperience stress. Personality is the\nway a person acts, feels and thinks. Many things influence a person's personality, including genetics and\nSome people, for example, are aggressive and always in\na hurry. They often become angry when\nthings do not happen the way they planned.\n\n1. Evaluate two different views on the nature of mental well-being and mental health: The term well-being can be used in different ways The New Economic Foundation describes well-being as how people experience their own lives. It is more than the absence of problems and illness, personal and social factors, and it is not just about happiness but enabling individuals and communities to do well in life and flourish. In 2011, the Government defined mental health as “The art and science of promoting well-being and equality and preventing mental ill health through population based interventions to: reduce risk and promote protective, evidence based interventions to improve physical and mental well-being; and create flourishing, connected individuals, families and communities. ”The strategy defined well-being as: “A positive state of mind and body, feeling safe and able to cope, with a sense of connection with people, communities and the wider environment. ”\n2. Explain the range of factors that may influence mental well-being and mental health problems across the life span, including:\nBiological factors: Since various biological factors can affect mood and behaviour, psychiatrists often evaluate these before initiating further treatment. For example dysfunction of the thyroid gland may mimic a major depressive episode, or hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) may mimic psychosis. Genetics, early environment, neurobiology, and psychological and social processes appear to be important contributory factors to the disorder schizophrenia. What happens during pregnancy can have affect on how the baby’s brain develops. For example if a mother is taking drugs while she is pregnant, or if she gets a virus (like the flu). There have been reports that suggest vitamin and mineral deficiencies such as Vitamin D, zinc and certain fatty acids may also be related to our mental health. Social factors: things that are going on around us, and how we feel about them can have a big impact on our mental health, things such as where we live, our place of work, whether we have close family and friends and how and where can we relax. Psychological factors: Your psychological state can influence your mental and emotional state, particularly if you are are coping with traumatic and abusive past or current experiences. Significant life events, like bereavement, divorce or if you have self-destructive thought patterns and perceptions, can impact on your mental health. For example post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and in more extreme cases Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID – in the past referred to as multiple personality disorder) are all mental health conditions that are commonly found in people who have been abused. 3. Explain how the following types of risk factors and protective factors influence levels of resilience in individuals and groups in relation to mental well-being and mental health: Risk factors including inequalities, poor quality social relationships: When we face difficult times our support networks become very important – those who do not have close friends or families, or those who do not live near the people who support them may find it increasingly difficult to cope alone. People coming from poor, uneducated backgrounds with the lack of knowledge and understanding of the importance of these relationships are suffer and increased disadvantage. Protective factors including socially valued roles, social support and contact: Whether you enjoy your work, or feel you are under too much pressure, are unable to find employment or hold down a job, can all put pressure on your mental well-being. The physical environment where we live can be very stressful, particularly when there are problems with neighbours, or if there are high crime rates and other such issues. 4. Explain the steps that an individual may take to promote their mental well-being and mental health: Numerous support groups are available for people affected by mental illness directly or indirectly, they can be found on the internet or through your GP If you experience problems concerning your mental health the first step of action should be to contact your GP, you can also find advice on government websites People known to have history of mental illness running in the family should take extra cautions, reduce other risk factors such as stress if possible Balanced, healthy life style is always a bonus. It is important to find and practice the things that makes us happy and relaxed as an individual to be able to recharge and deal with the day to day life 5. Explain how to support an individual in promoting their mental well-being and mental health: To make the individual aware of the support system available out there To establish the individual`s problems and needs Therapies e. g. cognitive behavioural therapy etc. Reinforce the positive things and values\n6.\n\nThe Negative Impact Of Stress [Infographic]\nIn 2020, the negative impact of stress can be felt in all areas of our lives. There is a profound and challenging struggle in understanding what is driving our stress, what its real impacts are, and ways we can manage our stress for our well-being. Having complementary daily strategies in place to manage and actively work to minimise stress is key to caring for your health in a holistic way that nurtures your long-term well-being. Why Is A Holistic Approach Necessary For Stress Management? Holistic steps play a significant role in approaching a health issue like stress because the triggers are genuinely multifaceted. Additionally, the impacts are far-reaching therefore dynamic methodologies can help you to work towards a healthier life. In fact, HealthKnowledge.org.uk says that, “Mental health and physical health are inextricably linked, with evidence for a strong relationship between the two accumulating over recent decades and challenging the historical notion of mind-body duality.” They go further to say that public mental health has been recognised as integral to public health, therefore emphasising the New Economics Foundation’s five evidence-based actions individuals can take for their well-being: connect, be active, take notice, keep learning, and give. A comprehensive combination of mindfulness, rest, rejuvenation, prioritising your physical health through diet and exercise, specialist and community support, and lifestyle planning are a starting point for you to approach handling stress as a well-being strategy rather than a stress strategy alone.

Stress can come from many sources, ranging from a noisy environment or an unpleasant coworker to major traumatic life events such as the death of a loved one or a natural disaster. Even happy occasions, such as getting a promotion or planning a wedding, can create stress. It's a very individual experience. What causes stress in one person may be no problem for another, and not everyone experiences the effects of stress the same way. Although stress is a mental experience, those effects also can be physical. Stress can literally make you sick. The body reacts to stress by releasing hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol, which cause your heart rate to accelerate, your blood pressure and glucose levels to rise, and your digestive system and immune system functions to slow down. Prolonged stress can create many unwelcome consequences: Insomnia, irritability, inability to concentrate, headaches, hives, back and stomach pain. Chronic stress has even been linked to heart disease and high blood pressure. That's really where the problems begin. Prolonged stress that doesn't go away can become a significant threat to your emotional and physical health, your work performance and your personal relationships. The first step in combating stress should be to determine its cause or causes. Knowing those will help you feel more in control right away. Then you can work to either eliminate or reduce those causes. If that's not possible, learn to cope with them differently and control your reactions. Identifying the causes of your stress might be a challenge, because so many different factors can be involved. Look at the various areas of your life, such as:\n* Health problems, such as chronic pain or the diagnosis of a long-term condition or disease. * Life changes such as moving, starting a new job or having a baby. * Family issues, which could include divorce or caring for an elderly parent. * Internal stressors including worry about your work performance or anxiety over social interactions. * Financial concerns. * Work troubles such as unreasonable deadlines or difficult coworkers. Once the sources of stress are identified, determine which ones you can eliminate and which you can reduce your exposure to. Then take the necessary actions. Some sources of stress will always remain (or new ones will appear), so knowing stress management techniques, such as those listed below, is essential. * Maintain a healthy diet. Beware of stress-driven overeating, and keep caffeine and alcohol consumption at reasonable levels. * Write down things that make you feel stressed and what, if anything, you did in response that reduced your stress. This will help you monitor patterns over time. * Use a calendar. Write down your appointments, to-do lists and deadlines. Delegate where possible. Schedule in downtime (and give it high priority); taking even 15 minutes a day for yourself can help reduce stress. * Exercise is a very effective stress reliever. Find something you enjoy: Go for a run, play a sport, do some yoga poses. * Get enough sleep. This means getting into bed at a reasonable hour. If you can't sleep, stay there and read a book or listen to music. Avoid turning on the television. * Breathe deeply. Stop what you're doing, close your eyes and focus on your breathing – inhale through your nose, exhale very slowly through your mouth – for at least three minutes. * Spend time with friends and loved ones, and share your thoughts and your concerns. Laugh! It's a great stress reliever, so make it a priority to find something to laugh about each day. If these outlets are insufficient, talk to your doctor about getting professional help from a counselor or therapist. You'll never avoid stress completely, but you definitely can minimize its effects on your mind and body by eliminating or minimizing exposure to its sources and controlling your reactions to them. That's the recipe for a healthy, happy life that's not ruled by stress.

Whether we worry about money, work, health problems or Wall Street meltdowns, stress can be a serious problem in our lives—and not just because it batters emotions. Research shows that stress can affect our bodies and contribute to health problems, including headaches, depression and heart disease. The kind of stress that's particularly bad for us is long-term stress, as well as uncontrollable stress, according to the American Psychological Association. Stress and your health\nThe symptoms of stress are actually your body's way of responding to a threat. Hormones, including adrenaline and cortisol, are released into the blood, causing heart rate, blood pressure and blood sugar to rise. Known as the fight-or-flight response, these and other stress-induced changes may help prepare our bodies to address a challenge. While a reasonable amount of stress can keep us on our toes and help with daily challenges, too much stress may harm our health. Our bodies are ready to fight or run too often. Too much stress can make sleeping difficult and may contribute to headaches and neck, back and muscle aches. Stress can also make diseases such as asthma worse, slow down wound healing and contribute to depression. And, if you cope with stress by eating more, you could end up gaining unwanted weight. In addition, research suggests a link between stress and the following health concerns:\nGastrointestinal problems, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). While researchers don't yet know what causes IBS, stress can trigger symptoms, including diarrhea and constipation. Even in people who don't have IBS, problems such as diarrhea and constipation can occur in times of stress. Lowered immunity. Chronic stress may wear on the immune system, opening the door to the common cold or other viral or bacterial infections. Heart disease. Temporary, high levels of stress can trigger heart attacks in people with underlying heart problems, according to the American Medical Association. Research is also looking at links between chronic stress and heart disease, including the possibility that stress hormones directly damage the vascular system or the heart. Stress may also influence heart disease risk factors or trigger unhealthy behaviors, the American Heart Association reports. For example, people under stress may eat unhealthy foods, drink excessive alcohol, overeat, exercise less or smoke. Stress is also implicated in the accumulation of abdominal fat, a cardiovascular disease risk factor. Diabetes. Stress hormones can increase glucose levels, and some research suggests that long-term stress may contribute to the development of diabetes in some people. Also, people who have diabetes may find it harder to control their blood sugar when they're stressed, according to the American Diabetes Association. Cancer. Studies have reached conflicting conclusions, though some evidence suggests that stress may weaken the body's defense against certain cancers or cause unhealthy behaviors that increase cancer risk, according to the National Cancer Institute. Stress is unavoidable, but that doesn't mean we can't manage it. The first step is to recognize problem stress, which affects everyone differently. For some people, warning signs are headaches or an upset stomach. Other signs may be being irritable, sleepy or fatigued. Techniques for coping include changing how you handle stressful situations, exercising and committing even 15 minutes a day to quietly relax.

Nevertheless, this belief is not totally true, as those who do not earn much often have poor housing conditions or become homeless (Fritzell, Kangas, Hertzman, Blomgren, & Hiilamo, 2013). As a result, these people are negatively affected, and their physical, social, and emotional well-being suffer. On the basis of this information, professionals indicate that poor housing is widely associated with poor health status. Thus, many individuals who live in developed countries have poor housing conditions that provide adverse health and social influence because of increased risks to catch communicative diseases and stress. In particular, this paper will discuss physical issues, then psychological ones, and will end with a conclusion. Those citizens who have inadequate housing are more vulnerable to various diseases and have more health issues than those who have an opportunity to live in normal accommodation. For example, poor housing is often associated with polluted air because of problems with ventilation (Fitzpatrick, 2014). As a result, the condition of those people who already have respiratory issues worsens and those who are healthy become at a higher risk of having these problems (Polyzois, Polyzoi, Wells, & Koulis, 2016). Individuals often suffer from headaches and infectious diseases because they become weaker. It can be explained by the fact that these citizens are constantly under stress and because their homes are too cold. In addition to that, if many humans live in the same house, infections can easily spread so that each inhabitant can become ill (Adjei & Kyei, 2013). People also receive injuries because of the damaged housing and inadequately located things, which makes it difficult for them to remain positively approached. Cheap housing in developed countries is often overcrowded, so citizens lack privacy. People are social beings, and it is good for them to live next to each other, as they receive an opportunity to communicate, share information and resources. However, when “twenty people and more live in a three-bedroom place” no positive and advantageous environment can be created (Andersen, Wiliamson, Fernando, Redman, & Vincent, 2016, p. 9). Lacking space, they can hardly organize it, ensuring privacy and basic amenities. In this way, an opportunity to have enough sleep can hardly be obtained, and stressful situations are likely to be often faced. Moreover, it is much easier to catch a communicable disease in these conditions, especially for children who are more vulnerable and less cautious than adults (Bailie, Stevens, & McDonald, 2012). Thus, overcrowded locations make it more difficult for the population to remain healthy. Poor housing conditions can affect people’s mental health adversely, as they do not have an opportunity to be engaged in those activities that can improve their well-being. In particular, inadequate space and neighbours’ behaviour prevent individuals from having healthy diets, being physically active at home, and inviting friends and relatives to socialize with them. Poor housing does not allow families to have strong social ties, which makes them experience a lack of support (Jones-Rounds, Evans, & Braubach, 2014). Children often have no safe place to entertain, which puts parents under constant stress because of the necessity to pay much attention to the safety of their kids and the inability to have a required rest. Poor housing is often connected with depression and low self-esteem because humans spend much time thinking that they cannot afford to move to a better location because of financial problems (Jones-Rounds et al., 2014). Moreover, limited activity and inability to cook healthy food can lead to obesity, which also causes psychological issues making people depressed and frustrated because of their condition (Jones-Rounds et al., 2014). In this way, poor housing prevents individuals from living normal lives as they are often in a bad mood. Thus, it can be concluded that even those citizens who live in developed countries often have no opportunity to obtain decent housing, which affects their well-being. In the majority of cases, it happens because of the lack of finances and the inability to afford an expensive house or flat.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:bd3b51e2-7964-4d91-b98e-6fc106bfb8e2>"]},{"passage":"Do you believe that your home can have an impact on your mental health? There are many driving factors in your mental state, including genetics, character, personality, and relationships. The environment in your house is one, too. Here are some points to think about. Having a clean home helps create a peaceful environment. That is good for your mental well-being because you will not have to think about clutter all over the house. It gives you a sense of tranquility, helping you rest and relax. Having a well-lit home is also welcome, particularly for people suffering from depression. It is common for them to like dark environments, which could only aggravate their loneliness. This would also only get worse if you make it a habit. Allowing natural light in your house can make you feel happier and more positive. It can lift your mood, leading you to become more productive in whatever task you have at hand, whether it is spring-cleaning the house or preparing for the property maintenance franchise opportunities a friend has offered you. It is also essential that you get a good sleep every night. And the quality of sleep that you get to enjoy is also dependent on the environment of your bedroom. Parts of the Home\nAre you living with your family or friends? If you are living with your family, make sure you have a harmonious relationship. Eat meals together, spend time watching your favorite TV series, and talk at the end of the day, every day. Make it a point to spend quality time with each other. In case you are living with friends and have a hard time adjusting, you can talk to them to sort things out. Some parts of your home, meanwhile, can remind you of a breakup, like the flooring where you used to sit with your partner. This can affect your mood. If you are too affected, right now, it might help to go on a vacation for a while. Another aspect of the house that can influence your mood and health is the paint color. Happy colors like yellow, light pink, and other pastel hues promote a positive and delightful vibe. Dark colors can evoke too much emotion. Choose wisely. Home and Mental Health\nYour housing location can do a lot for your mental health, as well. You tend to feel good when you live in a peaceful neighborhood. On the other hand, living in a neighborhood where crime is prevalent and vandalism is an ongoing thing can scare you off. You can become paranoid and fearful for your life. Lastly, the environment of the house can affect not only your mental health but physical health, too. As mentioned above, the state of the neighborhood you belong to can affect your feelings. For example, some houses have harmful chemicals or metals because they are already old. You can get serious illnesses like lead poisoning. The condition of your mind is somehow affected by the house you live in. Choose to live in a safe, welcoming, and positive area if you are prone to get affected mentally. A beautiful home, even if it is small, can help you think of good things and focus on living well. Live in a place where you can have peace of mind.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:068fded4-f2d5-48b6-9bd7-65181a9f5a05>"]},{"passage":"How Stress Affects Our Health\nIn modern times, stress-free living seems like a utopia. While certain stress levels are adaptive responses to circumstances and are considered normal, chronic or intense stress is a state of activation of the nervous system that is associated with several long-term illnesses. We cannot live in a state of continuous stress or else our body will send us warning signals in the form of illness, injuries, or a general feeling of being unwell. Therefore, keeping ourselves from excess stress is good for our health. What is stress and what is it for? Stress is a response that triggers in the brain when it perceives an external demand, such as a deadline for a job or a threat from a robbery from which you must run away. People, because of our capacity for imagination, can also experience stress as a result of mere thoughts, rather than actual events. “The voice of the ego constantly alters the natural state of wellness of the body. Almost every human body is under a lot of pressure and stress, not because it is threatened by some external factor, but by the internal action of the mind.”\nAcute stress, which is produced by a particular stimulus that we must solve puts our body in a state of activation. This allows us to react faster and with more energy, more focus, etc. It creates a tension that prepares us for action. However, chronic conditions make this activation permanent, causing a constant flow of stress hormones which ends up wasting our energy. Our hormones are out of balance and this ends up deteriorating our overall health. Effects of stress on health\nTo continue, we will name the main effects of this state of pressure and mental strain on our health. Although we must be clear that they are mainly generated by a confluence of factors. - Depression and anxiety: chronic stress can cause long-lasting states of depression and anxiety due to a hormonal imbalance and the waste of energy it involves. - Skin problems and hair loss: skin rashes like acne or eczema may be caused by continuous stress. Other conditions such as atopic dermatitis or psoriasis are exacerbated and worsened. Besides this, it can cause excessive hair loss, which in some cases may lead to complete baldness. - Menstrual problems: stress is closely related to hormones, whose prolonged imbalance can cause menstrual problems, from intensely painful periods to irregularities in the menstrual cycle; in severe cases menstruation may even disappear. - Digestive problems: stress alters the functioning of the digestive system. It makes digestion very difficult; the typical “nothing is sitting well with me.” It deregulates the intestinal transit and is also closely related to the onset of stomach ulcers because it increases the production of digestive acids that enhance these problems. - Sleep problems: as we’ve all experienced at some point, stressful situations prevent sleep or make us wake up in the middle of the night without being able to go back to sleep. Problems with insomnia are not only negative themselves, but they pose extra wear and tear because the inability to sleep well affects the performance of all tasks during daytime hours. - Arterial and heart problems: pressure and prolonged mental fatigue is related to serious diseases such as hypertension and coronary heart disease; although these effects are long term, they are really serious and should show us how necessary it is to reduce stress. - Weight problems: often stressful states encourage us to eat compulsively, which adds to the brain failing to correctly perceive the signs that we are satisfied. That is why stress is related to obesity and even diabetes. What can you do to reduce stress\nDepending on the situation that generates it and the tendency for anxiety of each person, stress can be very difficult to eradicate completely. However, there are always things we can do to reduce it as much as we can. - Doing sports is a great ally against stress. Practicing any sport lowers tension and releases energy that would otherwise remain within us and erode our resources. The simple act of walking two or three times a week will make a big difference, although doing a more intense sport will be more effective. - Another one of the most important aspects to consider when dealing with stress is diet. A healthy and balanced diet, especially rich in omega 3 fatty acids (like those found in fish), helps reduce stress, as a well-nourished body is a better regulated body. - The practice of relaxing activities such as mindfulness, meditation, yoga or psychological relaxation techniques are very beneficial to minimize stress. Sometimes finding time for yourself, taking a swim, walking … makes a difference.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:7f11d3d3-e4dd-46b1-9226-f21e3cacb885>"]},{"passage":"There are many sources of stress in life, some overt, some less obvious. One type of stress that doesn’t get a lot of attention but has a big effect on our health is the stress associated with our environment. Some environments are very low stress – like getting out in nature. Other environments, like a loud, noisy industrial factory, wear on us much differently. If you’re trying to live a healthy life, you need to consider all the inputs, including how your environment affects you. Here, we’ll take a look at environmental stress and its effects. What Is Environmental Stress? Environmental stressors cause both short- and long-term health impacts on the body and mind. Environmental stress refers to how people or animals respond to physical, chemical and biological features of their environment. These stressors may include exposure to natural disasters, electromagnetic radiation, pollution, climate change, or noise. They can be pathogens that invade the body, causing a stress response, or features of your workplace like an uncomfortable chair. Whether one-time or long-term, environmental stressors cause strain on the body and mind. The response of the body ranges from a short-term fight-or-flight response to long-term changes to your health. A Brief History of Stress Research\nHans Selye first coined the term stress in 1950 as “the non-specific response of the body to any demand.” Since then, scientists have learned much more about stress. For animals – which we are – stressors may include predators, the availability of food, illness, or changes in the living environment. Humans face those stressors but also perceived threats, relationship issues, work concerns, and more. Environmental stress psychology focuses on how people’s mental wellness responds to physical, biological, and chemical stressors. How the Body Responds to Stress\nWhen faced with a stressor, the body reacts in predictable ways. If it’s an immediate threat – you spot a venomous snake – your body prepares itself via what scientists call the fight-or-flight response. This bodily response prepares you to either fight the snake or run away. Faced with an immediate threat, your body responds with a fight-or-flight adrenaline rush. Longer-term stressors can cause more lasting health impacts. For more mundane threats, which most environmental stressors are, the body responds in more nuanced ways. This subtle stress response can be even more harmful to your health than acute threats because it comes without fanfare. You may experience an unpleasant feeling of anxiety, or you may think nothing much about the chemical factory at the end of your street, but these constant stressors have serious impacts on your health, longevity, and mental wellness. Because the stressor is constant, you may not realize the long-term effects and the importance of removing it from your life. The Body’s Response to Short-Term Stress\nDuring a fight-or-flight response, the body releases a series of catecholamine stress hormones, including norepinephrine and epinephrine. These hormones cause your body to react in several ways: your stomach gets nervous, your heart races, your breath rate increases, your palms get sweaty, and your hands shake. Acute stress can affect your emotions, reduce your problem-solving ability, and cause other short-term psychological disturbances. If the threat is severe enough, you might even lose control of your bowels. Paradoxically, exposure to some short-term stressors – also called event stressors – can help the body have a stronger immune system. In these quick, sudden threats, the body redirects “killer T-cells” to the skin, where they boost the immune response. The exception to this is when conditions triggering the body’s fight-or-flight response become a regular occurrence, such as domestic violence. The immune system responds negatively to regular short-term acute stressors. The Health Effects of Long-Term Exposure to Stress\nWe face hundreds of environmental stressors daily. Some of these everyone is exposed to, like legacy chemicals that accumulate in people’s bodies because they are omnipresent throughout the world. Others are unique to an individual’s location, like living next to a railroad track or surviving a natural disaster like Hurricane Harvey or the California wildfires.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e971bb7a-33b5-45ca-8815-c61cbd98c1cb>"]},{"passage":"Whether it be a health crisis, job loss, death of a loved one, break up or other difficulty, we all must face and confront losses.

Genetics, early environment, neurobiology, and psychological and social processes appear to be important contributory factors to the disorder schizophrenia. What happens during pregnancy can have affect on how the baby’s brain develops. For example if a mother is taking drugs while she is pregnant, or if she gets a virus (like the flu). There have been reports that suggest vitamin and mineral deficiencies such as Vitamin D, zinc and certain fatty acids may also be related to our mental health. Social factors: things that are going on around us, and how we feel about them can have a big impact on our mental health, things such as where we live, our place of work, whether we have close family and friends and how and where can we relax. Psychological factors: Your psychological state can influence your mental and emotional state, particularly if you are are coping with traumatic and abusive past or current experiences. Significant life events, like bereavement, divorce or if you have self-destructive thought patterns and perceptions, can impact on your mental health. For example post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and in more extreme cases Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID – in the past referred to as multiple personality disorder) are all mental health conditions that are commonly found in people who have been abused. 3. Explain how the following types of risk factors and protective factors influence levels of resilience in individuals and groups in relation to mental well-being and mental health: Risk factors including inequalities, poor quality social relationships: When we face difficult times our support networks become very important – those who do not have close friends or families, or those who do not live near the people who support them may find it increasingly difficult to cope alone. People coming from poor, uneducated backgrounds with the lack of knowledge and understanding of the importance of these relationships are suffer and increased disadvantage. Protective factors including socially valued roles, social support and contact: Whether you enjoy your work, or feel you are under too much pressure, are unable to find employment or hold down a job, can all put pressure on your mental well-being. The physical environment where we live can be very stressful, particularly when there are problems with neighbours, or if there are high crime rates and other such issues. 4. Explain the steps that an individual may take to promote their mental well-being and mental health: Numerous support groups are available for people affected by mental illness directly or indirectly, they can be found on the internet or through your GP If you experience problems concerning your mental health the first step of action should be to contact your GP, you can also find advice on government websites People known to have history of mental illness running in the family should take extra cautions, reduce other risk factors such as stress if possible Balanced, healthy life style is always a bonus. It is important to find and practice the things that makes us happy and relaxed as an individual to be able to recharge and deal with the day to day life 5. Explain how to support an individual in promoting their mental well-being and mental health: To make the individual aware of the support system available out there To establish the individual`s problems and needs Therapies e. g. cognitive behavioural therapy etc. Reinforce the positive things and values\n6.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:8871d1c8-5054-4e5e-b0f7-ea00292dd3b6>"]},{"passage":"The Negative Impact Of Stress [Infographic]\nIn 2020, the negative impact of stress can be felt in all areas of our lives. There is a profound and challenging struggle in understanding what is driving our stress, what its real impacts are, and ways we can manage our stress for our well-being. Having complementary daily strategies in place to manage and actively work to minimise stress is key to caring for your health in a holistic way that nurtures your long-term well-being. Why Is A Holistic Approach Necessary For Stress Management? Holistic steps play a significant role in approaching a health issue like stress because the triggers are genuinely multifaceted. Additionally, the impacts are far-reaching therefore dynamic methodologies can help you to work towards a healthier life. In fact, HealthKnowledge.org.uk says that, “Mental health and physical health are inextricably linked, with evidence for a strong relationship between the two accumulating over recent decades and challenging the historical notion of mind-body duality.” They go further to say that public mental health has been recognised as integral to public health, therefore emphasising the New Economics Foundation’s five evidence-based actions individuals can take for their well-being: connect, be active, take notice, keep learning, and give. A comprehensive combination of mindfulness, rest, rejuvenation, prioritising your physical health through diet and exercise, specialist and community support, and lifestyle planning are a starting point for you to approach handling stress as a well-being strategy rather than a stress strategy alone. Learn More About The Negative Impacts Of Stress To Care For Yourself\nThis infographic is designed to help you as you work to nurture your health in a mindful way. Study Medicine Europe has shared the graphic to support you with key facts about the physical and mental impacts of stress, explain more about risk factors and associated health conditions, and educate you on exactly what happens when you are stressed.

Stress can come from many sources, ranging from a noisy environment or an unpleasant coworker to major traumatic life events such as the death of a loved one or a natural disaster. Even happy occasions, such as getting a promotion or planning a wedding, can create stress. It's a very individual experience. What causes stress in one person may be no problem for another, and not everyone experiences the effects of stress the same way. Although stress is a mental experience, those effects also can be physical. Stress can literally make you sick. The body reacts to stress by releasing hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol, which cause your heart rate to accelerate, your blood pressure and glucose levels to rise, and your digestive system and immune system functions to slow down. Prolonged stress can create many unwelcome consequences: Insomnia, irritability, inability to concentrate, headaches, hives, back and stomach pain. Chronic stress has even been linked to heart disease and high blood pressure. That's really where the problems begin. Prolonged stress that doesn't go away can become a significant threat to your emotional and physical health, your work performance and your personal relationships. The first step in combating stress should be to determine its cause or causes. Knowing those will help you feel more in control right away. Then you can work to either eliminate or reduce those causes. If that's not possible, learn to cope with them differently and control your reactions. Identifying the causes of your stress might be a challenge, because so many different factors can be involved. Look at the various areas of your life, such as:\n* Health problems, such as chronic pain or the diagnosis of a long-term condition or disease. * Life changes such as moving, starting a new job or having a baby. * Family issues, which could include divorce or caring for an elderly parent. * Internal stressors including worry about your work performance or anxiety over social interactions. * Financial concerns. * Work troubles such as unreasonable deadlines or difficult coworkers. Once the sources of stress are identified, determine which ones you can eliminate and which you can reduce your exposure to. Then take the necessary actions. Some sources of stress will always remain (or new ones will appear), so knowing stress management techniques, such as those listed below, is essential. * Maintain a healthy diet. Beware of stress-driven overeating, and keep caffeine and alcohol consumption at reasonable levels. * Write down things that make you feel stressed and what, if anything, you did in response that reduced your stress. This will help you monitor patterns over time. * Use a calendar. Write down your appointments, to-do lists and deadlines. Delegate where possible. Schedule in downtime (and give it high priority); taking even 15 minutes a day for yourself can help reduce stress. * Exercise is a very effective stress reliever. Find something you enjoy: Go for a run, play a sport, do some yoga poses. * Get enough sleep. This means getting into bed at a reasonable hour. If you can't sleep, stay there and read a book or listen to music. Avoid turning on the television. * Breathe deeply. Stop what you're doing, close your eyes and focus on your breathing – inhale through your nose, exhale very slowly through your mouth – for at least three minutes. * Spend time with friends and loved ones, and share your thoughts and your concerns. Laugh! It's a great stress reliever, so make it a priority to find something to laugh about each day. If these outlets are insufficient, talk to your doctor about getting professional help from a counselor or therapist. You'll never avoid stress completely, but you definitely can minimize its effects on your mind and body by eliminating or minimizing exposure to its sources and controlling your reactions to them. That's the recipe for a healthy, happy life that's not ruled by stress.

Whether we worry about money, work, health problems or Wall Street meltdowns, stress can be a serious problem in our lives—and not just because it batters emotions. Research shows that stress can affect our bodies and contribute to health problems, including headaches, depression and heart disease. The kind of stress that's particularly bad for us is long-term stress, as well as uncontrollable stress, according to the American Psychological Association. Stress and your health\nThe symptoms of stress are actually your body's way of responding to a threat. Hormones, including adrenaline and cortisol, are released into the blood, causing heart rate, blood pressure and blood sugar to rise. Known as the fight-or-flight response, these and other stress-induced changes may help prepare our bodies to address a challenge. While a reasonable amount of stress can keep us on our toes and help with daily challenges, too much stress may harm our health. Our bodies are ready to fight or run too often. Too much stress can make sleeping difficult and may contribute to headaches and neck, back and muscle aches. Stress can also make diseases such as asthma worse, slow down wound healing and contribute to depression. And, if you cope with stress by eating more, you could end up gaining unwanted weight. In addition, research suggests a link between stress and the following health concerns:\nGastrointestinal problems, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). While researchers don't yet know what causes IBS, stress can trigger symptoms, including diarrhea and constipation. Even in people who don't have IBS, problems such as diarrhea and constipation can occur in times of stress. Lowered immunity. Chronic stress may wear on the immune system, opening the door to the common cold or other viral or bacterial infections. Heart disease. Temporary, high levels of stress can trigger heart attacks in people with underlying heart problems, according to the American Medical Association. Research is also looking at links between chronic stress and heart disease, including the possibility that stress hormones directly damage the vascular system or the heart. Stress may also influence heart disease risk factors or trigger unhealthy behaviors, the American Heart Association reports. For example, people under stress may eat unhealthy foods, drink excessive alcohol, overeat, exercise less or smoke. Stress is also implicated in the accumulation of abdominal fat, a cardiovascular disease risk factor. Diabetes. Stress hormones can increase glucose levels, and some research suggests that long-term stress may contribute to the development of diabetes in some people. Also, people who have diabetes may find it harder to control their blood sugar when they're stressed, according to the American Diabetes Association. Cancer. Studies have reached conflicting conclusions, though some evidence suggests that stress may weaken the body's defense against certain cancers or cause unhealthy behaviors that increase cancer risk, according to the National Cancer Institute. Stress is unavoidable, but that doesn't mean we can't manage it. The first step is to recognize problem stress, which affects everyone differently. For some people, warning signs are headaches or an upset stomach. Other signs may be being irritable, sleepy or fatigued. Techniques for coping include changing how you handle stressful situations, exercising and committing even 15 minutes a day to quietly relax.

This collaboration helps in gathering different professional perspectives to make better informed decisions about the child's education.","answer":"Working with other specialists when assessing a child can provide a comprehensive understanding of the child's needs and abilities. Different specialists bring unique expertise, which allows for a holistic evaluation that considers various aspects of the child's development, such as cognitive, emotional, social, and physical. This collaborative approach ensures that no critical area is overlooked and helps in identifying potential issues or strengths that might not be apparent with a single-perspective evaluation.\n\nHere are several ways working with other specialists can be beneficial:\n\n1. **Diverse Perspectives:** Each specialist offers a different lens through which to view the child's development. For example, a psychologist might focus on emotional and cognitive development, while an occupational therapist looks at fine motor skills and sensory processing. Combining these perspectives gives a more complete picture.\n\n2. **Comprehensive Assessment:** A multidisciplinary team can conduct a thorough assessment that covers a wide range of areas. This might include intelligence testing, speech and language evaluation, physical examination, and behavioral observations.\n\n3. **Tailored Interventions:** With a clearer understanding of the child's strengths and weaknesses, specialists can work together to design a personalized intervention plan. This plan might include a combination of therapies, educational strategies, and support services tailored to the child's specific needs.\n\n4. **Coordinated Support:** Collaboration among specialists ensures that all aspects of the child's life are considered, from home to school. This coordination helps in creating a cohesive support system that addresses the child's needs across different environments.\n\n5. **Professional Development:** Working with other specialists can also be an opportunity for professional growth. It allows each professional to learn from others' expertise, enhancing their own practice and ability to serve children effectively.\n\n6. **Family Involvement:** Specialists can work together to ensure that parents and caregivers are well-informed and equipped to support the child's development. This might involve providing resources, training, or ongoing support to help parents implement strategies at home.\n\n7. **Early Identification and Intervention:** A collaborative approach can lead to early identification of developmental delays or disorders, which is crucial for timely intervention and better outcomes.\n\n8. **Accountability and Consistency:** When multiple specialists are involved, there is a shared responsibility for the child's progress. This can lead to more consistent and effective support as all parties are aligned in their goals and strategies.\n\nIn summary, working with other specialists in child assessment offers a more nuanced understanding of the child, leading to more effective interventions and a stronger support network. It's a collaborative effort that prioritizes the child's overall well-being and development.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: Treatment Help, Part 3\nSomeone who has just spent some time with your child should be able to give you a few reactions or observations. It is completely reasonable to let evaluators know that you’d like a few minutes at the end of the session to get a sense of what they think. Always take notes. You may be more tense than you realize, and it may be hard to remember exactly what you did or didn’t hear. Ask to have unfamiliar terms spelled out and explained and request sources of information you can consult. If you’ve had a full multi-specialty evaluation done, consider making an appointment to come back in, sit down, and discuss the results. Keep a notebook. As time goes by, you will think of questions you want to ask, observations about your child that seem significant, ideas for further assessment or therapy. Write them all down in a notebook. There you can also make note of the specialists you see, the tests they do, the information they give. Jot down phone numbers of programs or specialists you learn about from other parents, as well as contact data for someone who isn’t that helpful now but may be in a few years. A notebook will help you track your child and your own understanding. It will also help you use your time with the specialists to ask the questions you’ve been wanting to bring up. Trust your instincts. Go into this process with an open mind but also with a healthy degree of skepticism. If someone tells you something that absolutely does not fit with your sense of your child, consider it objectively. If it’s nonsense, forget it. Don’t let someone who can’t answer questions to your satisfaction pursue a long-term therapeutic relationship with your child, no matter how grand or glorious his degrees or reception room. Don’t expect a “eureka” moment. We’ll say it again because it’s so important: By and large, quirky kids don’t fit neatly into diagnostic categories. The ongoing process of having your child assessed and considering different diagnoses can be valuable if it points the way to helping your child. Still, it’s probably not going to yield a single, illuminating conclusion when you find out what’s “really” going on. Some specialists or clinics will give almost anyone a diagnosis. If you look hard and long enough, you will come across someone who will pin a label on your child—perhaps because it’s the same label everybody gets at that particular clinic. Be especially wary of labels that carry immediate recommendations for expensive therapists. Don’t let anyone prey on your desire to help your child. It’s worth getting a second opinion or discussing the recommendation with your own pediatrician. Most of the professionals you will encounter as you look into assessment and diagnosis will be honorable. It must be said, however, that there is something of an industry out there in providing diagnoses and therapies to kids with developmental variations. This brings us, once again, to our preference for the academic medical center. Finally, don’t forget that the point of all this—the workup, the testing, the consideration of your child by multiple experts—is not to come up with the right label, the right name, the right answer on some cosmic medical-student exam. It’s to help your child—and to help you help your child. Adapted from Quirky Kids (Ballantine), by Perri Klass, M.D., and Eileen Costello, M.D. Reprinted with permission from Random House.

Amazing vocabularies, confidence in the company of adults, endless creativity and emotional intelligence beyond their years. While others struggle with background noise and refuse to put pen to paper due to sensory issues and perfectionism. The start of a new school year is often when parents decide to have their children assessed to gain clarity and direction for the year ahead. Armed with information for teachers, parents are empowered by an expert opinion. Deciding to seek a professional opinion can take months or years of deliberation. Some put off an assessment in the hope their child will ‘catch-up’ or ‘settle down’ with maturity. Others proactively seek a standardized assessment with the view to access evidence-based intervention as soon as possible. In my experience, young people respond positively to intensive support tailored to meet their needs in the home, school and community setting. They thrive with extra attention and understanding. A significant event or developmental milestone, such a starting kindergarten, changing school or starting secondary school may trigger parents to make an appointment with a psychologist. Common goals for intervention include ‘behaviour management strategies‘, ‘greater classroom support’ and ‘to help my child maintain friendships’. Whatever the precursor, the assessment process begins when parents engage in a joint appointment to provide background information. The initial interview is an opportunity to learn more about the child’s developmental history while gaining a detailed account of the child’s presentation at home and school. Many parents bring school reports or previous assessments to pinpoint their child’s strengths and weaknesses. Telephone consultations are often recommended between the teacher and the psychologist to gather current insights into any social or behavioural issues. The information provided by teachers and parents is essential to establish the best way forward. The psychologist’s plan is referred to as a ‘case plan’. A case plan may include a selection of standardized assessment tools to be administered in the clinic setting; playground and classroom observations or programs to be facilitated with same-aged peers. Popular goals identified by young clients in their initial appointments are often on par with developing academic confidence, gaining independence and establishing organizational skills. For children, this often equates to greater understanding from the adults around them, as opposed to frustration or pressure to perform. For parents and teachers, the assessment process often brings about clarity, direction and initiates a team approach to solving the issues. In some cases following an assessment, parents and teachers are divided by a diagnosis or lack of diagnosis. According to some parents, pre-school teachers have been known to confidently diagnose Autism based on observation alone. We also hear from schools seeking “a DSM-V diagnosis” in order to apply for funding. In these circumstances, a psychologist is likely to suggest a case conference at the school, involving parents and teachers to mediate around the pros and cons of a diagnosis or a label. Semantics aside, most parents are more interested in the recommendations included in an assessment, as opposed to a diagnosis. This detailed list of practical ideas is designed to harness individual strengths while addressing areas in need of support. Community-based programs, such as daily swimming or kid’s yoga courses, often compliment clinic and classroom interventions. It was a pleasure to participate during the 2011 Educational & Developmental conference in Melbourne last month. A great incentive for us in attending to the conference was Professor Nancy Mather’s workshop. Professor Nancy is a special education expert from the University of Arizona specializing in learning disabilities diagnosis and intervention. Kimberley O’Brien – who also presented during the conference – and our team have enjoyed the current research findings from colleagues around Australia. More about our participation\nKimberley O’Brien, our principal child psychologist , presented on her PhD research topic on Social Inclusion, Self Esteem and Belonging For Students in Transition From Primary to Secondary School, that Kimberley is completing under the direction of Prof Helen Watt from Monash University. About the conference\nThe Conference —Theory to Practice: Positive Development and Wellbeing, Educational and Developmental Psychology Conference 2011— is being hosted by the APS College of Educational and Developmental Psychologists to promote a broad spectrum of research in the sector from psycho-social wellbeing through to learning, literacy and numeracy. The College is committed to evidence-based practice and to promoting the best research and latest developments in the field. What this means for our clients?\n\nFor that reason, they often make an oppositional youngster uncomfortable. The structure and level of aggrevation the child slips into this part of the assessment can be quite revealing and helpful in planning intervention. Two common examples of projectives are sentence completion tasks and standardized ink blot instruments. Diagnostic interview: A comprehensive interview with the child provides a wealth of strategic information. I happen to use a 155 question interview that I developed for this purpose (although it’s not always necessary to ask them all). The interview captures the youngster’s take on peer relationships, school functioning, factors of home and community and, of course, self. It samples their concerns in their terms, providing insight to areas where they would be most receptive to intervention. All this information is then complied into a comprehensive report that outlines the findings, provides a diagnosis (if there is one), and offers recommendations for intervention. The cost of an assessment like this ranges from a few hundred dollars to well over $1,000. Health insurance generally covers some, if not all, of the expense. Who can do these evaluations? Psychologists can, as well as anyone else trained and licensed or certified to do all components of the assessment. If your child’s oppositional and defiant behavior is causing them to have serious trouble progressing through school, you might ask the school to do an assessment. They have folks on staff who do this sort of thing all the time. They usually have at least one doctorate level psychologist on staff or as a consultant to help with the tougher challenges. Large counties often have a county psychological board (check the phone book) that can refer specialists who work with children. Also, a department of psychology or counseling of a nearby university (universities offer graduate training) might provide assistance or direction. In some cases, they may provide actual counseling or therapy services through their lab programs. Although the services are being provided by students, they are supervised, and they are usually motivated to do a good job. You don’t have much to lose, and the cost is minmal (like free, if they need kids). Keep in mind also that school counselors are required to maintain a resource list as part of their Crisis Response Plan. Ask them; they can probably help directly, or initiate a referral. Then, of course, there’s always the phone book. I believe it is best to find someone who specializes in children and adolescents. Who should do the counseling or therapy? For obvious reasons, it helps a lot if it is the same person who did the assessment. Rapport is already established, and there is no confusion regarding the interpretation of assessment results. Sometimes, however, this is not possible. I get a lot of calls and email asking about how to locate specialists in ODD in different states. Sorry, I’m not aware of any registry like this, although county psychological boards might list specialties. That would be a good place to start.\n\nTreatment For Mental Health Disorders In Children\n- Advice on managing distressing feelings and unwanted behaviour\n- Family appointments to think about ways to resolve problems together\n- Individual therapy for your child to help them understand their feelings and learn new ways of coping\n- Medication prescribed by a child and adolescent psychiatrist\n- Support to other professionals about how best they can help you and your child\nCognitive Behavioural Therapy\nA model that focuses on the relationship between thoughts, feelings and behaviours and explores practical and meaningful ways of working through current difficulties. The young person is understood as part of an organic and evolving system, for example the family. Change in one part of the system affects the system as a whole. Parent Training (Behavioural Therapy)\nThe therapist coaches parents in applying such strategies as rewarding positive behaviour, and responding to negative behaviour with clear consequences and time out . There is increasing evidence that medication can be a helpful addition to other treatments in some conditions e.g. severe depression, OCD, ADHD\nLiaison with Other Agencies\nIt is often important to share information about the child with professionals e.g. teachers, Paediatricians or school nurses, so that everyone is working together. When A Child Is Referred To Us\n- All referrals are discussed by the team before a first appointment is offered. An initial appointment may be with any of the team, depending on the problem being referred. - We would usually see the parents and child together as well as separately, as appropriate. - After this, further sessions with the same clinician may be offered if appropriate, or a more detailed assessment organised with other members of the team. - At the end of an assessment or piece of treatment, we would usually produce a report for the family, which can be shared with others e.g. GPs, with the family’s consent\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat mental health problems can children experience? Whilst serious mental illnesses are rare in children, emotional and behavioural problems are common, for example:\n- Low mood\n- Poor performance at school\nThese may be a response to stresses in a child’s environment, such as bereavement, illness in a family member, or divorce. The child may be suffering trauma, such as bullying. Or they may have a developmental disability such as a learning difficulty, autism or Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). Who are the different people that make up the CAMHS multidisciplinary team? - Child and adolescent psychiatrists – these are medical doctors who specialise in young people’s mental health, including the use of psychological and pharmacological therapy. They have specialist knowledge of child development, the links between physical and mental health, and how biological, psychological and social issues may combine to produce mental health problems. - Clinical psychologists – these have a comprehensive doctoral training in mental health and emotional wellbeing. They have detailed knowledge of patterns of thinking, feeling, relating and behaviour. They can complete assessments that can indicate issues that may affect learning (e.g. memory, attention). Clinical psychologists may specialise in particular therapies e.g. family therapy or Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). - Child and adolescent mental health nurses – these are qualified mental health nurses who specialise in working with young people with mental health problems and their families. They often have additional training in specific therapies e.g. family therapy, CBT, parent training, or psychodynamic approaches to treatment. They usually work in multidisciplinary teams, liaising closely with GPs, schools, and social workers, etc. Does my child need a child psychiatrist? It may not be necessary for your child to see a psychiatrist. All members of our team are highly qualified and experienced, and our nurse and psychologist are able to offer initial assessments. They are also experts in psychological treatments e.g. parenting support, family work, individual therapy. A psychiatrist may need to be involved if:\n- There are concerns about serious mental illness, physical ill-health, or a complex developmental disorder. - Psychological approaches haven’t been sufficient and another treatment, such as medication, needs to be considered. Why does CAMHS share information with other professionals? We have a legal and professional duty to do what is in a child’s best interests, which includes sharing information when necessary. Children will often be experiencing difficulties in multiple settings e.g. school, home, social situations. Treatment may therefore combine clinic-based therapy, parents carrying out behaviour management strategies at home, and support from school. All the adults working together (e.g.\n\nAs a therapist’s ability to form relationships and customize treatments play key roles, some key points to think about when choosing your therapist include:\nYou can also enquire about the psychologist’s theories of practice, specialties, length of experience, academic degrees, and the extent of psychologist’s personal psychotherapy. Finding a good therapist match is important for successful outcome. Always remember that you do not have to stick to one therapist if you find him\/her not suitable. A good time to ask and find out more about your therapist is during the first\/ consultation session. The therapist will also be asking you questions to assess suitability, and may suggest referral to a more suitable therapist should he\/she find that more appropriate. Difficulties are an inevitable part of our lives and during no stage of growth can we confidently say we are perfectly happy. However, when a concern for you or your dear ones reach a level of severity that are clearly effecting the different areas of functioning such as family\/personal, academics\/occupational or social life and no help or advice from friends and relatives seem to be solving the issue, you should seek help from a specialist, in this case a psychologist. The psychologist uses their objective observations to make experienced clinical judgments that are non-biased and are aimed to design the most suitable plan of treatment for the client. Usually, this consists of a detailed psychological assessment of the client followed by a structured goal oriented psychotherapy. Here are just some of our areas of expertise:\nHere are just some of our areas of expertise:\nA Consult is an initial interaction between the primary caregiver (parents) and the psychologist where parents state and elaborate the concerns their child might be having. Here, focus is placed on collecting all the relevant information from the primary caregiver regarding the child to aid in case formulation and draw a preliminary picture of the possible intervention plan that will successfully reduce the difficulties. Although we assume that the child is the one who is struggling, the primary caregiver (parent) is most informed about the origin and course of the concerns in addition to the developmental history of the child. An accurate account of this information ultimately leads to rightly dealing with the concerns. Psychologists are trained professionals who help to ensure the mental health and emotional well-being of all people: individuals, families, and groups. They perform testing, evaluate and treat a full range of emotional and psychological challenges.

A psychological assessment is conducted by a psychologist to ascertain an individual’s current level of functioning. The focus of the assessment and choice of assessment tools varies depending on the referral concerns and will be discussed and agreed upon during the initial consult. As the underlying cause of an individual’s problems are not always clear (For example, if a child is having trouble at school, does he have a learning difficult or is it ADHD or is deficits in memory), the results of the assessment allow a psychologist to gather a comprehensive understanding of the child. Results from the assessment is never focused on a single test score, instead, an individual’s competencies and limitations are evaluated and reported on in an objective but helpful manner. Understanding of a child’s strengths and weaknesses and the nature of the problem will help a psychologist to figure out the best way to address the challenges faced. Psychotherapy and Counselling are professional interventions that utilise an interpersonal relationship to enable people to develop self-understanding and to make changes in their lives. Therapists rarely offer advice, instead they guide clients to discover their own answers and support them through the actions they choose to take. While counselling and psychotherapy overlap considerably and are terms often used interchangeably, there exist a slight distinction between them. The focus of counselling is more likely to deal with present issues that can be easily resolved on the conscious level (e.g., specific problems, changes in life and fostering wellbeing) while psychotherapy is more concerned with the restructuring of self and beliefs, and the development of insight.\n\nSchool Psychologists are trained to offer consultation to teachers as a method of establishing interventions for a student in a classroom. Consultation is intended to be a cooperative process between school psychologists and teachers as an effort to promote success in students who are struggling. It can be used to help intervene with children displaying behavioral, emotional, or academic difficulties and help prevent the development of a more serious problem. Together, the School Psychologist and the teacher identify the problem, develop specific goals, brainstorm interventions, and create a plan to help the student become more successful. The psychologist helps the teacher to develop a detailed and specific plan for the student. - Establish a cooperative partnershipThe school psychologist and the teacher collaborate and develop a cooperative partnership. They share the mutual goal of wanting to promote success for a student. Relationship building is an essential part of this process. - Clarify the problemDefine the problem in clear, concise, and measurable terms. The consultant should help the consultee develop goals and expectations. - Problem AnalysisIt is important to collect baseline data for future evaluation of the intervention and to help clarify the problem. It is also important to look for precursors to the behavior. Environmental, instructional, and personal factors are important to consider. - Brainstorming and Exploring intervention optionsThe level of intervention must be determined first, and then brainstorming can begin. Several interventions may be suggested. - Selecting and interventionThe suggested interventions should be discussed and evaluated. The teacher and the school psychologist choose one intervention. Responsibilities should be clearly decided upon. See creating behavior plans for more info\n- Implementing the strategyThe intervention is implemented for a set amount of time. - Evaluating intervention effectiveness and follow-upEffectiveness of the intervention is measured by comparing current data with the baseline data. Determine if modifications to the intervention are needed.

Anne O’Brien, an experienced teacher and headteacher of young children, explores how we can use the observations we have made to inform the next stage of our planning. - Observing the children as they play and learn\n- Talking with children and finding out what they know, can do and how they feel\n- Analysing and interpreting what you see and hear. Assessment does not stand alone. It transcends all teaching and learning opportunities. It is an important starting point. When you know what the children can do and know, you can decide what they need next. Assessment can enable you to improve your own professional skills. As you assess the children you will discover what is successful and what doesn’t work. You will be able to identify tasks, which allowed real growth and development of skills, and through analysis you will be able to identify the factors, which contributed to this success – and use them again to inform future planning. You will become a more skilled professional. Three key questions to keep in mind are:\n- Why do we need it? - What can it tell us? - How can we use it? - supports children’s learning\n- affects future planning\n- contributes to professional development\n- amend your short term planning\n- inform your medium term and long term plans\n- adapt activities to suit the needs of individual children\n- modify tasks to match children’s known abilities\n- provide children with positive and specific feedback as they work and play. The rest of this article provides a route into how effective observation within your setting can raise the level of professionalism amongst your staff. Staff need to be trained in how to observe, how to interpret\ntheir observations and how to use the information they have acquired to inform their future planning and activities. We all know about the importance of observing children as they play, learn and interact with others. We see how they learn as we watch them. We notice the way they approach a problem. We can identify those who methodically try different ways or repeat their actions after a failed attempt. We identify those who give up on the first attempt if it’s not successful or those who are unwilling to try something new. We see what they learn. We can spot steps towards the learning of skills and knowledge. We can see aspects that are proving too tricky at this moment. So what! If your observations stop there, it has all been a waste of your time. ‘Observations are not an end in themselves but a tool for gathering information about a child.’ (Kay 2005, p90)\nWhat happens to your observations? Are they planned, or are your staff simply looking around and chancing upon a child achieving or struggling? If observations are recorded, how is that information then used? Here are some questions, which will help you to focus on what is happening in your setting. They could be a starting point for discussion with your team as you develop your assessment practice. Are observations recorded as soon as possible? - Carry a notebook in your pocket and jot down your observations ready to be recorded later onto your formal documents\n- Keep a card index file – one child per card – in your room and jot down notes\n- Carry Post-it notes to jot down observations to be transferred to formal documents later\nHow often do you observe each child? - Put the names of the children for whom you are the key worker in your notebook, one per page, at the start of each day. Choose two or three of your children per day and observe them all on a rota system. - Allocate one member of the team per session to carry out observations of all of the children at a particular activity, and share the information later. - Put an agreed number of cards in the front of a file index box at the start of each day, and observe those for whom you are the key worker, returning their cards to the back of the box at the end of the day. - Make a weekly check to ensure all children are being observed regularly. Do you observe children at a variety of activities over time? - Focus on one activity per session, having set up a specific activity for this. - Change the focus activity each session so that you cover child-led, adult-led, free and organised, indoor and outdoor, individual and group activities over the week. Are all staff members involved in observations, discussion and planning? - Observations, planning and learning will be more effective if all members of your team are involved. Do you discuss your observations with your colleagues? - Think about your plans: at the end of the week look through your observations together and evaluate the planned activities in relation to your observations. Did the activities allow the children to gain the skills or the knowledge that you intended?\n\nTips for others planning similar projects\n- Identify all your stakeholders\n- Engage senior management\n- Be realistic about the amount of time it will take\n- Lobby hard for sufficient resources\n- Develop a robust action plan\n- Keep checking to ensure you don’t slip\n“oh it’s easy” - staff nurse – Rabbit Ward\n“about time too – I’m fed up of hearing about the adult tool and not having one to use” – Sister – Squirrel Ward\n“these new scales are brilliant – I can do the BMI now” – Sister – Rabbit Ward\n“Hazel this PYMS tool is amazing – I would have completely missed malnutrition in this patient but his score is 5 – we’ve already referred him to the dietitian” – HCA – Paediatric Assessment Unit\n\nAs a parent with a child newly diagnosed with autism, it can be easy to ask yourself, “What do I do for my child diagnosed with autism?” This is a reaction that is to be expected and can be followed with overwhelming feelings and a lot of questions. The good news is that parents don’t have to let an autism diagnosis intimidate or overwhelm them because they are not alone on this journey. Families can find a lot of support, resources, and services through talking to their child’s doctor and team of therapists, teachers at the child’s school, as well as other parents in the autism community. Having and maintaining communication between the child’s team, as well as support groups will prove to be helpful. Your child’s team could consist of the child’s doctor or developmental pediatrician, occupational therapist, speech language pathologist, as well as other mental and physical health professionals, and special education or other services through your child’s school. This team is helpful and does best when working together with the parents and child when setting goals and putting services into place. Steps after receiving your child’s diagnosis of autism\nFamilies play a large role for autistic children. They have been the ones that have witnessed the differing and sometimes difficult to understand behaviors, noticed differences in the child’s development, they know the child’s strengths, and have been there when they learn new skills and language or communication development. The child’s parents will meet with the team and they will discuss the child’s development, strengths, and goals to work towards. The parents will also receive information on community support and services that are available for the newly diagnosed autistic child. The meetings are as frequent as is decided by the parents and team. This is a great time for any questions or concerns to be brought out and discussed. Depending on when your child was diagnosed, there are early intervention services available to support the early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders. These help jump start your child’s therapies and other services that they may qualify for. When plans and goals are figured, they are then put together to form a very individualized plan for your child. Each part and therapy is discussed at the initial meeting and discussed at each decided upon meeting afterward. There may be a need for an individual evaluation following the full assessment that your child already had to receive a diagnosis of autism. These individual evaluations would depend on the practitioner, for instance there may be an assessment for speech therapy, behavioral therapy, or occupational therapy to get a baseline for the therapist to develop a specialized path for your child’s development and growth in that area, based on the goals discussed. What can I do to help my child? There is a lot that parents can do when it comes to helping their autistic child through their therapies and services. Parents learn a lot either through the observation of therapy, or through more hands-on activities like pretend play, using sign language to build communication skills, as well as being there during real life social situations being their child’s support. Attending autism parents support groups, reading quality books about autism spectrum disorder written by parents, autistic individuals, and professionals, and using the skills you have gained through observation and parent education that can be available through services like Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) or other therapies can help build your confidence, while helping your child. The members on your child’s team should be able to answer questions and offer specific suggestions that would benefit your child and family. Through my experience, therapists strongly suggest that parents continue what the child is learning during a session at home and will generally give the parent and\/or family the tools and support to help the process. That is one of the reasons that parents, caregivers, individuals, and the team come together to create the goals that will shape the therapies and services for the growth and success of the individual.

There are many different ways that parents can find support so that they have the skills, or can start building the skills to best help their child’s development. It can be very individualized, depending on the specifics of your child’s diagnosis, or it can be broad and cover a spectrum, depending on what the parent is looking for. There are many different kinds of support groups for parents, siblings, and families of individuals diagnosed with autism.\n\n### Question: How can working with other specialists help when assessing a child?","passages":[{"passage":"Treatment Help, Part 3\nSomeone who has just spent some time with your child should be able to give you a few reactions or observations. It is completely reasonable to let evaluators know that you’d like a few minutes at the end of the session to get a sense of what they think. Always take notes. You may be more tense than you realize, and it may be hard to remember exactly what you did or didn’t hear. Ask to have unfamiliar terms spelled out and explained and request sources of information you can consult. If you’ve had a full multi-specialty evaluation done, consider making an appointment to come back in, sit down, and discuss the results. Keep a notebook. As time goes by, you will think of questions you want to ask, observations about your child that seem significant, ideas for further assessment or therapy. Write them all down in a notebook. There you can also make note of the specialists you see, the tests they do, the information they give. Jot down phone numbers of programs or specialists you learn about from other parents, as well as contact data for someone who isn’t that helpful now but may be in a few years. A notebook will help you track your child and your own understanding. It will also help you use your time with the specialists to ask the questions you’ve been wanting to bring up. Trust your instincts. Go into this process with an open mind but also with a healthy degree of skepticism. If someone tells you something that absolutely does not fit with your sense of your child, consider it objectively. If it’s nonsense, forget it. Don’t let someone who can’t answer questions to your satisfaction pursue a long-term therapeutic relationship with your child, no matter how grand or glorious his degrees or reception room. Don’t expect a “eureka” moment. We’ll say it again because it’s so important: By and large, quirky kids don’t fit neatly into diagnostic categories. The ongoing process of having your child assessed and considering different diagnoses can be valuable if it points the way to helping your child. Still, it’s probably not going to yield a single, illuminating conclusion when you find out what’s “really” going on. Some specialists or clinics will give almost anyone a diagnosis. If you look hard and long enough, you will come across someone who will pin a label on your child—perhaps because it’s the same label everybody gets at that particular clinic. Be especially wary of labels that carry immediate recommendations for expensive therapists. Don’t let anyone prey on your desire to help your child. It’s worth getting a second opinion or discussing the recommendation with your own pediatrician. Most of the professionals you will encounter as you look into assessment and diagnosis will be honorable. It must be said, however, that there is something of an industry out there in providing diagnoses and therapies to kids with developmental variations. This brings us, once again, to our preference for the academic medical center. Finally, don’t forget that the point of all this—the workup, the testing, the consideration of your child by multiple experts—is not to come up with the right label, the right name, the right answer on some cosmic medical-student exam. It’s to help your child—and to help you help your child. Adapted from Quirky Kids (Ballantine), by Perri Klass, M.D., and Eileen Costello, M.D. Reprinted with permission from Random House.

Amazing vocabularies, confidence in the company of adults, endless creativity and emotional intelligence beyond their years. While others struggle with background noise and refuse to put pen to paper due to sensory issues and perfectionism. The start of a new school year is often when parents decide to have their children assessed to gain clarity and direction for the year ahead. Armed with information for teachers, parents are empowered by an expert opinion. Deciding to seek a professional opinion can take months or years of deliberation. Some put off an assessment in the hope their child will ‘catch-up’ or ‘settle down’ with maturity. Others proactively seek a standardized assessment with the view to access evidence-based intervention as soon as possible. In my experience, young people respond positively to intensive support tailored to meet their needs in the home, school and community setting. They thrive with extra attention and understanding. A significant event or developmental milestone, such a starting kindergarten, changing school or starting secondary school may trigger parents to make an appointment with a psychologist. Common goals for intervention include ‘behaviour management strategies‘, ‘greater classroom support’ and ‘to help my child maintain friendships’. Whatever the precursor, the assessment process begins when parents engage in a joint appointment to provide background information. The initial interview is an opportunity to learn more about the child’s developmental history while gaining a detailed account of the child’s presentation at home and school. Many parents bring school reports or previous assessments to pinpoint their child’s strengths and weaknesses. Telephone consultations are often recommended between the teacher and the psychologist to gather current insights into any social or behavioural issues. The information provided by teachers and parents is essential to establish the best way forward. The psychologist’s plan is referred to as a ‘case plan’. A case plan may include a selection of standardized assessment tools to be administered in the clinic setting; playground and classroom observations or programs to be facilitated with same-aged peers. Popular goals identified by young clients in their initial appointments are often on par with developing academic confidence, gaining independence and establishing organizational skills. For children, this often equates to greater understanding from the adults around them, as opposed to frustration or pressure to perform. For parents and teachers, the assessment process often brings about clarity, direction and initiates a team approach to solving the issues. In some cases following an assessment, parents and teachers are divided by a diagnosis or lack of diagnosis. According to some parents, pre-school teachers have been known to confidently diagnose Autism based on observation alone. We also hear from schools seeking “a DSM-V diagnosis” in order to apply for funding. In these circumstances, a psychologist is likely to suggest a case conference at the school, involving parents and teachers to mediate around the pros and cons of a diagnosis or a label. Semantics aside, most parents are more interested in the recommendations included in an assessment, as opposed to a diagnosis. This detailed list of practical ideas is designed to harness individual strengths while addressing areas in need of support. Community-based programs, such as daily swimming or kid’s yoga courses, often compliment clinic and classroom interventions. It was a pleasure to participate during the 2011 Educational & Developmental conference in Melbourne last month. A great incentive for us in attending to the conference was Professor Nancy Mather’s workshop. Professor Nancy is a special education expert from the University of Arizona specializing in learning disabilities diagnosis and intervention. Kimberley O’Brien – who also presented during the conference – and our team have enjoyed the current research findings from colleagues around Australia.

The structure and level of aggrevation the child slips into this part of the assessment can be quite revealing and helpful in planning intervention. Two common examples of projectives are sentence completion tasks and standardized ink blot instruments. Diagnostic interview: A comprehensive interview with the child provides a wealth of strategic information. I happen to use a 155 question interview that I developed for this purpose (although it’s not always necessary to ask them all). The interview captures the youngster’s take on peer relationships, school functioning, factors of home and community and, of course, self. It samples their concerns in their terms, providing insight to areas where they would be most receptive to intervention. All this information is then complied into a comprehensive report that outlines the findings, provides a diagnosis (if there is one), and offers recommendations for intervention. The cost of an assessment like this ranges from a few hundred dollars to well over $1,000. Health insurance generally covers some, if not all, of the expense. Who can do these evaluations? Psychologists can, as well as anyone else trained and licensed or certified to do all components of the assessment. If your child’s oppositional and defiant behavior is causing them to have serious trouble progressing through school, you might ask the school to do an assessment. They have folks on staff who do this sort of thing all the time. They usually have at least one doctorate level psychologist on staff or as a consultant to help with the tougher challenges. Large counties often have a county psychological board (check the phone book) that can refer specialists who work with children. Also, a department of psychology or counseling of a nearby university (universities offer graduate training) might provide assistance or direction. In some cases, they may provide actual counseling or therapy services through their lab programs. Although the services are being provided by students, they are supervised, and they are usually motivated to do a good job. You don’t have much to lose, and the cost is minmal (like free, if they need kids). Keep in mind also that school counselors are required to maintain a resource list as part of their Crisis Response Plan. Ask them; they can probably help directly, or initiate a referral. Then, of course, there’s always the phone book. I believe it is best to find someone who specializes in children and adolescents. Who should do the counseling or therapy? For obvious reasons, it helps a lot if it is the same person who did the assessment. Rapport is already established, and there is no confusion regarding the interpretation of assessment results. Sometimes, however, this is not possible. I get a lot of calls and email asking about how to locate specialists in ODD in different states. Sorry, I’m not aware of any registry like this, although county psychological boards might list specialties.

Whilst serious mental illnesses are rare in children, emotional and behavioural problems are common, for example:\n- Low mood\n- Poor performance at school\nThese may be a response to stresses in a child’s environment, such as bereavement, illness in a family member, or divorce. The child may be suffering trauma, such as bullying. Or they may have a developmental disability such as a learning difficulty, autism or Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). Who are the different people that make up the CAMHS multidisciplinary team? - Child and adolescent psychiatrists – these are medical doctors who specialise in young people’s mental health, including the use of psychological and pharmacological therapy. They have specialist knowledge of child development, the links between physical and mental health, and how biological, psychological and social issues may combine to produce mental health problems. - Clinical psychologists – these have a comprehensive doctoral training in mental health and emotional wellbeing. They have detailed knowledge of patterns of thinking, feeling, relating and behaviour. They can complete assessments that can indicate issues that may affect learning (e.g. memory, attention). Clinical psychologists may specialise in particular therapies e.g. family therapy or Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). - Child and adolescent mental health nurses – these are qualified mental health nurses who specialise in working with young people with mental health problems and their families. They often have additional training in specific therapies e.g. family therapy, CBT, parent training, or psychodynamic approaches to treatment. They usually work in multidisciplinary teams, liaising closely with GPs, schools, and social workers, etc. Does my child need a child psychiatrist? It may not be necessary for your child to see a psychiatrist. All members of our team are highly qualified and experienced, and our nurse and psychologist are able to offer initial assessments. They are also experts in psychological treatments e.g. parenting support, family work, individual therapy. A psychiatrist may need to be involved if:\n- There are concerns about serious mental illness, physical ill-health, or a complex developmental disorder. - Psychological approaches haven’t been sufficient and another treatment, such as medication, needs to be considered. Why does CAMHS share information with other professionals? We have a legal and professional duty to do what is in a child’s best interests, which includes sharing information when necessary. Children will often be experiencing difficulties in multiple settings e.g. school, home, social situations.

Finding a good therapist match is important for successful outcome. Always remember that you do not have to stick to one therapist if you find him\/her not suitable. A good time to ask and find out more about your therapist is during the first\/ consultation session.

Usually, this consists of a detailed psychological assessment of the client followed by a structured goal oriented psychotherapy. Here are just some of our areas of expertise:\nHere are just some of our areas of expertise:\nA Consult is an initial interaction between the primary caregiver (parents) and the psychologist where parents state and elaborate the concerns their child might be having. Here, focus is placed on collecting all the relevant information from the primary caregiver regarding the child to aid in case formulation and draw a preliminary picture of the possible intervention plan that will successfully reduce the difficulties. Although we assume that the child is the one who is struggling, the primary caregiver (parent) is most informed about the origin and course of the concerns in addition to the developmental history of the child. An accurate account of this information ultimately leads to rightly dealing with the concerns.

A psychological assessment is conducted by a psychologist to ascertain an individual’s current level of functioning. The focus of the assessment and choice of assessment tools varies depending on the referral concerns and will be discussed and agreed upon during the initial consult. As the underlying cause of an individual’s problems are not always clear (For example, if a child is having trouble at school, does he have a learning difficult or is it ADHD or is deficits in memory), the results of the assessment allow a psychologist to gather a comprehensive understanding of the child. Results from the assessment is never focused on a single test score, instead, an individual’s competencies and limitations are evaluated and reported on in an objective but helpful manner. Understanding of a child’s strengths and weaknesses and the nature of the problem will help a psychologist to figure out the best way to address the challenges faced.

Anne O’Brien, an experienced teacher and headteacher of young children, explores how we can use the observations we have made to inform the next stage of our planning. - Observing the children as they play and learn\n- Talking with children and finding out what they know, can do and how they feel\n- Analysing and interpreting what you see and hear. Assessment does not stand alone. It transcends all teaching and learning opportunities. It is an important starting point. When you know what the children can do and know, you can decide what they need next. Assessment can enable you to improve your own professional skills. As you assess the children you will discover what is successful and what doesn’t work. You will be able to identify tasks, which allowed real growth and development of skills, and through analysis you will be able to identify the factors, which contributed to this success – and use them again to inform future planning. You will become a more skilled professional. Three key questions to keep in mind are:\n- Why do we need it? - What can it tell us? - How can we use it? - supports children’s learning\n- affects future planning\n- contributes to professional development\n- amend your short term planning\n- inform your medium term and long term plans\n- adapt activities to suit the needs of individual children\n- modify tasks to match children’s known abilities\n- provide children with positive and specific feedback as they work and play. The rest of this article provides a route into how effective observation within your setting can raise the level of professionalism amongst your staff. Staff need to be trained in how to observe, how to interpret\ntheir observations and how to use the information they have acquired to inform their future planning and activities. We all know about the importance of observing children as they play, learn and interact with others. We see how they learn as we watch them. We notice the way they approach a problem. We can identify those who methodically try different ways or repeat their actions after a failed attempt. We identify those who give up on the first attempt if it’s not successful or those who are unwilling to try something new. We see what they learn. We can spot steps towards the learning of skills and knowledge. We can see aspects that are proving too tricky at this moment. So what! If your observations stop there, it has all been a waste of your time. ‘Observations are not an end in themselves but a tool for gathering information about a child.’ (Kay 2005, p90)\nWhat happens to your observations? Are they planned, or are your staff simply looking around and chancing upon a child achieving or struggling? If observations are recorded, how is that information then used? Here are some questions, which will help you to focus on what is happening in your setting. They could be a starting point for discussion with your team as you develop your assessment practice. Are observations recorded as soon as possible? - Carry a notebook in your pocket and jot down your observations ready to be recorded later onto your formal documents\n- Keep a card index file – one child per card – in your room and jot down notes\n- Carry Post-it notes to jot down observations to be transferred to formal documents later\nHow often do you observe each child? - Put the names of the children for whom you are the key worker in your notebook, one per page, at the start of each day. Choose two or three of your children per day and observe them all on a rota system. - Allocate one member of the team per session to carry out observations of all of the children at a particular activity, and share the information later. - Put an agreed number of cards in the front of a file index box at the start of each day, and observe those for whom you are the key worker, returning their cards to the back of the box at the end of the day. - Make a weekly check to ensure all children are being observed regularly. Do you observe children at a variety of activities over time? - Focus on one activity per session, having set up a specific activity for this. - Change the focus activity each session so that you cover child-led, adult-led, free and organised, indoor and outdoor, individual and group activities over the week. Are all staff members involved in observations, discussion and planning? - Observations, planning and learning will be more effective if all members of your team are involved. Do you discuss your observations with your colleagues? - Think about your plans: at the end of the week look through your observations together and evaluate the planned activities in relation to your observations. Did the activities allow the children to gain the skills or the knowledge that you intended?","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:61e7bcf5-822f-47ce-9415-e1eca44301cd>"]},{"passage":"Tips for others planning similar projects\n- Identify all your stakeholders\n- Engage senior management\n- Be realistic about the amount of time it will take\n- Lobby hard for sufficient resources\n- Develop a robust action plan\n- Keep checking to ensure you don’t slip\n“oh it’s easy” - staff nurse – Rabbit Ward\n“about time too – I’m fed up of hearing about the adult tool and not having one to use” – Sister – Squirrel Ward\n“these new scales are brilliant – I can do the BMI now” – Sister – Rabbit Ward\n“Hazel this PYMS tool is amazing – I would have completely missed malnutrition in this patient but his score is 5 – we’ve already referred him to the dietitian” – HCA – Paediatric Assessment Unit","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:237b2b55-b30f-4fef-8db6-9c6606b9a587>"]},{"passage":"As a parent with a child newly diagnosed with autism, it can be easy to ask yourself, “What do I do for my child diagnosed with autism?” This is a reaction that is to be expected and can be followed with overwhelming feelings and a lot of questions. The good news is that parents don’t have to let an autism diagnosis intimidate or overwhelm them because they are not alone on this journey. Families can find a lot of support, resources, and services through talking to their child’s doctor and team of therapists, teachers at the child’s school, as well as other parents in the autism community. Having and maintaining communication between the child’s team, as well as support groups will prove to be helpful. Your child’s team could consist of the child’s doctor or developmental pediatrician, occupational therapist, speech language pathologist, as well as other mental and physical health professionals, and special education or other services through your child’s school. This team is helpful and does best when working together with the parents and child when setting goals and putting services into place. Steps after receiving your child’s diagnosis of autism\nFamilies play a large role for autistic children. They have been the ones that have witnessed the differing and sometimes difficult to understand behaviors, noticed differences in the child’s development, they know the child’s strengths, and have been there when they learn new skills and language or communication development. The child’s parents will meet with the team and they will discuss the child’s development, strengths, and goals to work towards. The parents will also receive information on community support and services that are available for the newly diagnosed autistic child. The meetings are as frequent as is decided by the parents and team. This is a great time for any questions or concerns to be brought out and discussed. Depending on when your child was diagnosed, there are early intervention services available to support the early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders. These help jump start your child’s therapies and other services that they may qualify for. When plans and goals are figured, they are then put together to form a very individualized plan for your child. Each part and therapy is discussed at the initial meeting and discussed at each decided upon meeting afterward. There may be a need for an individual evaluation following the full assessment that your child already had to receive a diagnosis of autism. These individual evaluations would depend on the practitioner, for instance there may be an assessment for speech therapy, behavioral therapy, or occupational therapy to get a baseline for the therapist to develop a specialized path for your child’s development and growth in that area, based on the goals discussed. What can I do to help my child? There is a lot that parents can do when it comes to helping their autistic child through their therapies and services. Parents learn a lot either through the observation of therapy, or through more hands-on activities like pretend play, using sign language to build communication skills, as well as being there during real life social situations being their child’s support. Attending autism parents support groups, reading quality books about autism spectrum disorder written by parents, autistic individuals, and professionals, and using the skills you have gained through observation and parent education that can be available through services like Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) or other therapies can help build your confidence, while helping your child. The members on your child’s team should be able to answer questions and offer specific suggestions that would benefit your child and family. Through my experience, therapists strongly suggest that parents continue what the child is learning during a session at home and will generally give the parent and\/or family the tools and support to help the process. That is one of the reasons that parents, caregivers, individuals, and the team come together to create the goals that will shape the therapies and services for the growth and success of the individual.

There are many different ways that parents can find support so that they have the skills, or can start building the skills to best help their child’s development. It can be very individualized, depending on the specifics of your child’s diagnosis, or it can be broad and cover a spectrum, depending on what the parent is looking for. There are many different kinds of support groups for parents, siblings, and families of individuals diagnosed with autism.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:64d38e87-2b11-4e67-8087-c18cb4f5e4c7>"]}]}

The 2 Gers are pictured receiving their winning prize of €250 each from Club Chairman, Micheal Lenihan. The next edition of LMS will take place in the coming weeks. Good friends Ger Lees & Ger Lenihan were the two final players left standing. Rather than fall out, they have decided to split the €500 first prize between them. Well done lads and enjoy the €250 each. The next edition of LMS will be starting in the next few weeks. Thanks to everyone who entered this time around. Round 6 took place last weekend with just 8 players remaining. The selections were Chelsea (2), Man Utd (4), Stoke (1) and Newcastle (1). Only 2 players now remain in contention for the €500 first prize. Ger Lees & Ger Lenihan both selected Chelsea, while the other six players were eliminated. And then there were just 8 players left standing as 6 crashed out due to the failure of Liverpool and Spurs to win their games. Selections were Man City (8), Spurs (5) & Liverpool (1)\nRound 6 takes place next weekend. Will there be a winner next weekend just in time for Christmas?

In 1616 the complete Iliad and Odyssey appeared in The Whole Works of Homer, the first complete English translation, which until Pope's was the most popular in the English language and was the way most English speakers encountered these poems. The endeavour was to have been profitable: his patron, Prince Henry, had promised him £300 on its completion plus a pension. However, Henry died in 1612 and his household neglected the commitment, leaving Chapman without either a patron or an income. In an extant letter, Chapman petitions for the money owed him; his petition was ineffective. Chapman's translation of the Odyssey is written in iambic pentameter, whereas his Iliad is written in iambic heptameter. (The Greek original is in dactylic hexameter.) Chapman often extends and elaborates on Homer's original contents to add descriptive detail or moral and philosophical interpretation and emphasis. Chapman's translation of Homer was much admired by John Keats, notably in his famous poem On First Looking into Chapman's Homer, and also drew attention from Samuel Taylor Coleridge and T. S. Eliot. Chapman also translated the Homeric Hymns, the Georgics of Virgil, The Works of Hesiod (1618, dedicated to Francis Bacon), the Hero and Leander of Musaeus (1618), and the Fifth Satire of Juvenal (1624). There is no danger to a man, that knows\nWhat life and death is: there's not any law\nExceeds his knowledge; neither is it lawful\nThat he should stoop to any other law. The English poet John Keats wrote \"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer\" for his friend Charles Cowden Clarke in October 1816. The poem begins \"Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold\" and is much quoted. For example, P. G. Wodehouse in his review of the first Flashman novel that came to his attention: \"Now I understand what that 'when a new planet swims into his ken' excitement is all about.\" Arthur Ransome uses two references from it in his children's books, the Swallows and Amazons series.

Usually considered to have been written down circa the 8th century BC, the Iliad is among the oldest extant works of Western literature, along with the Odyssey, another epic poem attributed to Homer which tells of Odysseus’s experiences after the events of the Iliad. Is the Iliad older than the Bible? No. The Iliad and Odyssey predate the Bible by several hundred years. Was the Iliad written before the Odyssey? The Iliad is the earlier work (it was written first) . Also the events in the Odyssey are a direct consequence of what happens in the Iliad and the reader of the Odyssey is assumed to know the summary of the plot in the Iliad and who the main characters are. Why did Homer write Iliad? Homer probably wished he could have witnessed the events of the Trojan War, but the actual battle dates more than 400 years before there was ever any mention of the poet Homer. Who Killed Achilles? The story of Achilles is one of the most important legends in Greek mythology. Achilles was said to have died from a heel wound as the result of a poisoned arrow shot by Paris, Hector’s brother (see Figure 2). Is the Iliad true? As the historical sources – Herodotus and Eratosthenes – show, it was generally assumed to have been a real event. According to Homer’s Iliad, the conflict between the Greeks – led by Agamemnon, King of Mycenae – and the Trojans – whose king was Priam – took place in the Late Bronze Age, and lasted 10 years. How old is the Iliad now? The text is Homer’s “Iliad,” and Homer — if there was such a person — probably wrote it in 762 B.C., give or take 50 years, the researchers found. The “Iliad” tells the story of the Trojan War — if there was such a war — with Greeks battling Trojans. Is the Iliad The oldest book? The Epic of Gilgamesh is the oldest known piece of literature in the world. Written in 2100 BCE it predates Homer’s Iliad by 1500 years. What does the word Iliad mean? 1a: a series of miseries or disastrous events. b: a series of exploits regarded as suitable for an epic. 2: a long narrative especially: an epic in the Homeric tradition. Is the Iliad hard to read? For the first-time reader, probably the hardest thing about Homer’s Iliad is its language. And once you get past the weird cultural details (reading the introduction to your edition will help), the poem is extremely accessible. The characters are vivid, and every reader will find someone to identify with. Is the Iliad a good read? It’s battle scenes are majestic, yet heartbreaking in it’s understanding of human tragedy, life and fate. It’s a beautifully deep work, it’s timeless and there is so much that can be learnt from it. Originally Answered: Is The Iliad worth reading? Yes, definitely. Is Troy based on a true story? No, ‘Troy‘ is not based on a true story. However, the film is based on the epic poem ‘The Iliad. What is the moral lesson of the Iliad? The Iliad, the story of the Trojan War, offers several moral lessons to its readers, including the importance of leaders treating their soldiers with respect, the importance of accepting apologies, and the need for respecting family bonds. What is Homer short for? Acronym. Definition. HOMER. Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (National Renewable Energy Laboratory)\nWhat is Homer’s full name? Homer (\/ˈhoʊmər\/; Ancient Greek: Ὅμηρος Greek pronunciation: [hómɛːros], Hómēros; c. 800– c. 701 BC) was the presumed author of the Iliad and the Odyssey, two epic poems that are the foundational works of ancient Greek literature.\n\nA Burlesque Translation of Homer, by Thomas Bridges; 1797; G.G. and J.Robinson, London\nHomer’s Iliad set to bawdy verse by Thomas Bridges (c.1710-c.1775), originally published in 1762 under the pseudonym Caustic Barebones. The work achieved some popularity, and was reprinted several times, the last in 1797. In 1765 Bridges wrote The Battle of the Genii, a burlesque of John Milton’s Paradise Lost, which was once attributed to Francis Grose. Bridges’ only novel was The Adventures of a Bank-Note, published in 1770. |Housed at: Internet Archive | From: University of Pittsburgh Library System|\n|Underlying Work: PD Worldwide | Digital Copy: Pending Clarification|\n|Download: PDF | Kindle | EPUB | Torrent|\n\nOne of the best-known and most influential of the Greek epics, Homer’s The Illiad is set during the ten-year siege of Troy. It regales stories of battles and events that take place during a quarrel between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles in the final year of the war. The Illiad —along with the accompanying Odyssey—are distinguished as the oldest extant works of Western literature, and are fundamental to the modern Western canon. Their style and content played such an important role in shaping subsequent Greek culture that Homer was often called the teacher of Greece. Like the works of Cicero, Homer’s work remains widely studied for its eloquent use of language. Innumerable works of literature, theater, and poetry have been written based on or responding to the Homeric epics, with the influence carrying up to today. For anyone interested in the study of rhetoric, literature, or Greek, The Illiad is a must. - Title: The Illiad\n- Author: Homer\n- Language: English\nHomer (ca. 8th century BC) is the subject of intense debate regarding his life and origins. No solid biographical information exists for Homer, though legends abound. His name is related to a Greek word meaning “blind,” giving rise to the tradition of Homer as the blind bard. Many modern scholars dismiss the notion of Homer as a single author, arguing that the works attributed to him are based on many generations of oral story telling. When speaking of Homer, these scholars are referring to the date in which the works attributed to Homer were created. Some scholars suggest that Homer refers to the function of redacting oral tradition into a coherent whole.\n\n'The Iliad WASN'T written by a man named Homer': Historian claims the name referred to a group of storytellers - and that they lived 1,000 years earlier than thought\n- Adam Nicolson says Homer was a tradition of storytelling not a single man\n- He believes The Iliad is 1,000 years older than dates for when Homer lived\n- He says the poems began as stories that were shared and refined orally\n- He began studying Homer ten years ago after being caught in a storm\n- Mr Nicolson has written a book on how Homer should be interpreted today\nThe ancient Greek poet Homer was not a single person but actually an entire culture of storytelling, a historian has claimed. Adam Nicolson, an author and historian who has studied Homer, believes the epic poems of The Iliad and The Odyssey have their origins around 2,000 BC - 1,000 years earlier than the man who wrote them is said to have lived. Instead, he claims the stories evolved as a tradition that were shared and refined as spoken poems for hundreds of years. Little is known about who Homer, seen here in an idealised marble bust from the Roman period, really was\nSpeaking in an interview with National Geographic, Mr Nicolson, who is the Fifth Baron Carnock, said that the idea of Homer as a single author has emerged due to an 'author obsession'. He said: 'I think it's a mistake to think of Homer as a person. Homer is an \"it\" - a tradition. Adam Nicolson has written a book about what Homer can tell us about life in the modern world\n'An entire culture coming up with ever more refined and ever more understanding ways of telling stories that are important to it.' There is very little known about exactly who or what Homer was, but is believed by the ancient Greeks to have been the first great epic poet. Some accounts claim he was a blind poet who lived between 1,102BC to 850BC. A guild of singing story tellers, or rhapsodes, later emerged known as the Homeridae and has led some to argue that Homer was actually a mythical figure whose name was derived from the guild. Some of the earliest written works attributed to Homer were found with the mummified remains of Green Egyptians from around 150-200 BC. The oldest complete Iliad manuscript is found in the doge's library in Venice and is thought to date from 900AD. Mr Nicolson, who lives in Kent, said that notes in the margins of this manuscript, which was created in the Constantinople-Byzantium, provide some clues to what the origin of the Iliad may have been. He said: 'One of the exciting things that emerge from that is that in the early days it seems there was no such thing as a single Iliad, no one fixed text, but this wild and variable tradition of the stories, with many different versions in different parts of the Mediterranean, endlessly interacting with itself, like a braided stream in the mountains.' Mr Nicolson said he first became interested in Homer around ten years ago when he began reading The Odyssey while waiting for his yacht to be repaired after it was damaged in a storm while sailing up the west coast of Britain. He describes reading The Odyssey as being like somebody 'telling me what it was like to be alive on Earth'. Homer is depicted as a blind bard in this painting by Jean-Baptiste August Leloir, held at the Louvre in Paris\nEarly written accounts of The Iliad, like this 5th or 6th Century codex in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, are very rare and the stories are thought to have been passed down by oral storytelling for hundreds of years\nAdam Nicolson, seen here during his BBC series on the history of British whale hunting, first read Homer's Odyssey while waiting for repairs on his yacht and believes Odysseus is a 'metaphor for all of our lives'\nLEGEND OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE WAS BASED ON REAL GOLD MINERS\nThe ancient Greek legend of Jason and his Argonauts' quest for the Golden Fleece may have been based on a real expedition to an ancient kingdom on the Black Sea. The story is thought to have been in circulation even at the time of Homer and was thought to have been a myth.\n\nby A.W.Johnston, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1990. 1.19 Morris, S.P.

Just as Homer's work existed most fully in its performance, so the Homeric texts call periodically for new translations. With this in mind, Fagles offers a new verse rendering of the Iliad. Maneuvering between the literal and the literary, he tries with varying degrees of success to suggest the vigor and manner of the original while producing readable poetry in English. Thus, he avoids the anachronizing of Robert Fitzgerald's translation, while being more literal than Richard Lattimore's. Fagles's efforts are accompanied by a long and penetrating introduction by Bernard Knox, coupled with detailed glossary and textual notes.-- T.L. Cooksey, Armstrong State Coll., Savannah, Ga.

In 1616 the complete Iliad and Odyssey appeared in The Whole Works of Homer, the first complete English translation, which until Pope's was the most popular in the English language and was the way most English speakers encountered these poems. The endeavour was to have been profitable: his patron, Prince Henry, had promised him £300 on its completion plus a pension. However, Henry died in 1612 and his household neglected the commitment, leaving Chapman without either a patron or an income. In an extant letter, Chapman petitions for the money owed him; his petition was ineffective. Chapman's translation of the Odyssey is written in iambic pentameter, whereas his Iliad is written in iambic heptameter. (The Greek original is in dactylic hexameter.) Chapman often extends and elaborates on Homer's original contents to add descriptive detail or moral and philosophical interpretation and emphasis. Chapman's translation of Homer was much admired by John Keats, notably in his famous poem On First Looking into Chapman's Homer, and also drew attention from Samuel Taylor Coleridge and T. S. Eliot. Chapman also translated the Homeric Hymns, the Georgics of Virgil, The Works of Hesiod (1618, dedicated to Francis Bacon), the Hero and Leander of Musaeus (1618), and the Fifth Satire of Juvenal (1624). There is no danger to a man, that knows\nWhat life and death is: there's not any law\nExceeds his knowledge; neither is it lawful\nThat he should stoop to any other law. The English poet John Keats wrote \"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer\" for his friend Charles Cowden Clarke in October 1816. The poem begins \"Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold\" and is much quoted. For example, P. G. Wodehouse in his review of the first Flashman novel that came to his attention: \"Now I understand what that 'when a new planet swims into his ken' excitement is all about.\" Arthur Ransome uses two references from it in his children's books, the Swallows and Amazons series.

Usually considered to have been written down circa the 8th century BC, the Iliad is among the oldest extant works of Western literature, along with the Odyssey, another epic poem attributed to Homer which tells of Odysseus’s experiences after the events of the Iliad. Is the Iliad older than the Bible? No. The Iliad and Odyssey predate the Bible by several hundred years. Was the Iliad written before the Odyssey? The Iliad is the earlier work (it was written first) . Also the events in the Odyssey are a direct consequence of what happens in the Iliad and the reader of the Odyssey is assumed to know the summary of the plot in the Iliad and who the main characters are. Why did Homer write Iliad? Homer probably wished he could have witnessed the events of the Trojan War, but the actual battle dates more than 400 years before there was ever any mention of the poet Homer. Who Killed Achilles? The story of Achilles is one of the most important legends in Greek mythology. Achilles was said to have died from a heel wound as the result of a poisoned arrow shot by Paris, Hector’s brother (see Figure 2). Is the Iliad true? As the historical sources – Herodotus and Eratosthenes – show, it was generally assumed to have been a real event. According to Homer’s Iliad, the conflict between the Greeks – led by Agamemnon, King of Mycenae – and the Trojans – whose king was Priam – took place in the Late Bronze Age, and lasted 10 years. How old is the Iliad now? The text is Homer’s “Iliad,” and Homer — if there was such a person — probably wrote it in 762 B.C., give or take 50 years, the researchers found. The “Iliad” tells the story of the Trojan War — if there was such a war — with Greeks battling Trojans. Is the Iliad The oldest book? The Epic of Gilgamesh is the oldest known piece of literature in the world. Written in 2100 BCE it predates Homer’s Iliad by 1500 years. What does the word Iliad mean? 1a: a series of miseries or disastrous events. b: a series of exploits regarded as suitable for an epic. 2: a long narrative especially: an epic in the Homeric tradition. Is the Iliad hard to read? For the first-time reader, probably the hardest thing about Homer’s Iliad is its language. And once you get past the weird cultural details (reading the introduction to your edition will help), the poem is extremely accessible. The characters are vivid, and every reader will find someone to identify with. Is the Iliad a good read? It’s battle scenes are majestic, yet heartbreaking in it’s understanding of human tragedy, life and fate. It’s a beautifully deep work, it’s timeless and there is so much that can be learnt from it. Originally Answered: Is The Iliad worth reading? Yes, definitely. Is Troy based on a true story? No, ‘Troy‘ is not based on a true story. However, the film is based on the epic poem ‘The Iliad. What is the moral lesson of the Iliad? The Iliad, the story of the Trojan War, offers several moral lessons to its readers, including the importance of leaders treating their soldiers with respect, the importance of accepting apologies, and the need for respecting family bonds. What is Homer short for? Acronym. Definition. HOMER. Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (National Renewable Energy Laboratory)\nWhat is Homer’s full name? Homer (\/ˈhoʊmər\/; Ancient Greek: Ὅμηρος Greek pronunciation: [hómɛːros], Hómēros; c. 800– c. 701 BC) was the presumed author of the Iliad and the Odyssey, two epic poems that are the foundational works of ancient Greek literature.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:fa404366-b33e-40cc-963b-ee0dcc6a7e3b>"]},{"passage":"A Burlesque Translation of Homer, by Thomas Bridges; 1797; G.G. and J.Robinson, London\nHomer’s Iliad set to bawdy verse by Thomas Bridges (c.1710-c.1775), originally published in 1762 under the pseudonym Caustic Barebones. The work achieved some popularity, and was reprinted several times, the last in 1797. In 1765 Bridges wrote The Battle of the Genii, a burlesque of John Milton’s Paradise Lost, which was once attributed to Francis Grose.

It regales stories of battles and events that take place during a quarrel between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles in the final year of the war. The Illiad —along with the accompanying Odyssey—are distinguished as the oldest extant works of Western literature, and are fundamental to the modern Western canon. Their style and content played such an important role in shaping subsequent Greek culture that Homer was often called the teacher of Greece. Like the works of Cicero, Homer’s work remains widely studied for its eloquent use of language. Innumerable works of literature, theater, and poetry have been written based on or responding to the Homeric epics, with the influence carrying up to today. For anyone interested in the study of rhetoric, literature, or Greek, The Illiad is a must. - Title: The Illiad\n- Author: Homer\n- Language: English\nHomer (ca. 8th century BC) is the subject of intense debate regarding his life and origins. No solid biographical information exists for Homer, though legends abound. His name is related to a Greek word meaning “blind,” giving rise to the tradition of Homer as the blind bard. Many modern scholars dismiss the notion of Homer as a single author, arguing that the works attributed to him are based on many generations of oral story telling. When speaking of Homer, these scholars are referring to the date in which the works attributed to Homer were created. Some scholars suggest that Homer refers to the function of redacting oral tradition into a coherent whole.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:9b963d50-00c4-45ec-a6bc-a07b1a10fa7c>"]},{"passage":"'The Iliad WASN'T written by a man named Homer': Historian claims the name referred to a group of storytellers - and that they lived 1,000 years earlier than thought\n- Adam Nicolson says Homer was a tradition of storytelling not a single man\n- He believes The Iliad is 1,000 years older than dates for when Homer lived\n- He says the poems began as stories that were shared and refined orally\n- He began studying Homer ten years ago after being caught in a storm\n- Mr Nicolson has written a book on how Homer should be interpreted today\nThe ancient Greek poet Homer was not a single person but actually an entire culture of storytelling, a historian has claimed. Adam Nicolson, an author and historian who has studied Homer, believes the epic poems of The Iliad and The Odyssey have their origins around 2,000 BC - 1,000 years earlier than the man who wrote them is said to have lived. Instead, he claims the stories evolved as a tradition that were shared and refined as spoken poems for hundreds of years. Little is known about who Homer, seen here in an idealised marble bust from the Roman period, really was\nSpeaking in an interview with National Geographic, Mr Nicolson, who is the Fifth Baron Carnock, said that the idea of Homer as a single author has emerged due to an 'author obsession'. He said: 'I think it's a mistake to think of Homer as a person. Homer is an \"it\" - a tradition. Adam Nicolson has written a book about what Homer can tell us about life in the modern world\n'An entire culture coming up with ever more refined and ever more understanding ways of telling stories that are important to it.' There is very little known about exactly who or what Homer was, but is believed by the ancient Greeks to have been the first great epic poet. Some accounts claim he was a blind poet who lived between 1,102BC to 850BC. A guild of singing story tellers, or rhapsodes, later emerged known as the Homeridae and has led some to argue that Homer was actually a mythical figure whose name was derived from the guild. Some of the earliest written works attributed to Homer were found with the mummified remains of Green Egyptians from around 150-200 BC. The oldest complete Iliad manuscript is found in the doge's library in Venice and is thought to date from 900AD. Mr Nicolson, who lives in Kent, said that notes in the margins of this manuscript, which was created in the Constantinople-Byzantium, provide some clues to what the origin of the Iliad may have been. He said: 'One of the exciting things that emerge from that is that in the early days it seems there was no such thing as a single Iliad, no one fixed text, but this wild and variable tradition of the stories, with many different versions in different parts of the Mediterranean, endlessly interacting with itself, like a braided stream in the mountains.' Mr Nicolson said he first became interested in Homer around ten years ago when he began reading The Odyssey while waiting for his yacht to be repaired after it was damaged in a storm while sailing up the west coast of Britain. He describes reading The Odyssey as being like somebody 'telling me what it was like to be alive on Earth'. Homer is depicted as a blind bard in this painting by Jean-Baptiste August Leloir, held at the Louvre in Paris\nEarly written accounts of The Iliad, like this 5th or 6th Century codex in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, are very rare and the stories are thought to have been passed down by oral storytelling for hundreds of years\nAdam Nicolson, seen here during his BBC series on the history of British whale hunting, first read Homer's Odyssey while waiting for repairs on his yacht and believes Odysseus is a 'metaphor for all of our lives'\nLEGEND OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE WAS BASED ON REAL GOLD MINERS\nThe ancient Greek legend of Jason and his Argonauts' quest for the Golden Fleece may have been based on a real expedition to an ancient kingdom on the Black Sea. The story is thought to have been in circulation even at the time of Homer and was thought to have been a myth.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:f98c6cde-acef-4749-8234-6e513e3b6aa0>"]},{"passage":"by A.W.Johnston, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1990. 1.19 Morris, S.P.

The city of New Orleans is a US city with a long history. One of the oldest cities in the US, New Orleans has become known as a cultural melting pot with a unique culture and cuisine. New Orleans is home to a rich culture, famous for their festivals, such as Mardi Gras, and is also known as the birthplace of jazz. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused considerable damage to the city of New Orleans. Many of the city's levees broke which caused water levels to rise, leaving much of the city underwater. In the events of global warming, New Orleans faces the danger of becoming submerged under the waters of the Gulf of Mexico once again. Zoom in on the city of New Orleans to zoom level 7. Have students locate New Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico. 2. On the Hazard Map, adjust the the sea levels from 0 meters to 1 meter. How is the city affected? At 5 meters sea level rise? 10 meters sea level rise? 20 meters? 3. Explain to students that if the sea levels of the world rise, the water will first flood the parts of the city with the lowest elevation. Elevation is the height of the land above the level of the sea. Rising sea levels would first affect coastal areas with low elevation. Extension for advanced students and high grade levels:\n4. Here is a map of New Orlean's elevations\nHow do the areas on this map correspond to the flooded areas in the CyArk Hazard Map? How does elevation play a role in sea level rise? How will melting glacial ice from Antarctica and Greenland affect sea levels? Find the list of materials above. Choose one of two methods below:\n1. Fill ziplock bags with water. 2. Place ziplock bags flat in the freezer and let freeze. 3. When the water has completely frozen into ice, remove the ice from the ziplock bag. You should now have a small, flat sheet of ice. 1. Using ice cubes, place about 6 ice cubes in a small container or ziplock bag. 2. Wet the ice cubes slightly and then place in the freezer. 3. Remove the ice cubes after they have frozen together to form a block of several ice cubes stuck together. 1. Fill a small plastic container with rocks or gravel. Alternatively, a small, unopened can (such as a tuna can) be be used. The container of choice should be relatively heavy to prevent the container from floating in water. This container will represent a continent or island. Place the weighted container in a large shallow pan. 2. Using sugar cubes and glue, have students construct a small city on top of the \"island.\" 3. Place another weighed container or can in the shallow pan. Place a large block of ice on top of the the weighed container. This will represent Antarctica and its thick layer of ice. 4. Using a pitcher, slowly fill the pan with water. Fill the container until the the water level reaches the top of the small container \"islands.\" Be careful not to splash water on the sugar cubes. 5. Measure the height of the water level in the pan with a ruler. Students should record the water level in their notebooks and record any observations about their sugar cube city. At this time students will write their predictions and hypothesis of what will happen as the ice cubes melt and what effect it will have on the sugar cube city. Optional: have students record their sugar cube city with a digital camera. 6. Direct the lamp towards the ice cubes in the container. The lamp represent solar activity and melts the ice cubes at a faster rate. 7. Once the sugar cubes have melted, students should measure the new water level with a ruler and record this number in their notebooks. Students should also record their observations on the sugar cube city. What happened to the city after the ice cubes melted? Did the level of the water rise? If so, by how much? Optional: have students photograph the sugar cube city after the ice melted. IV. Global Warming's Impact\nUsing the CyArk Hazard map (linked above) have students explore a local coastal town. Change the rise in sea levels to see how different parts of the city would be affected. Have students think of a recent trip to this city. How would your trip be different if the sea levels rose? What parts of the city would be different? What would be the same?\n\nStream Project-Planning Considerations\nWhen the Lewis & Clark Conservation District reviews 310 permit applications, we are required to consider the following factors:\nErosion and Sedimentation\nSupervisors have to look at the potential effects of the project on erosion and sedimentation, considering the methods available to complete the project and the nature and economics of various alternatives. Stream Channel Alteration\nSupervisors must review the effects of stream channel alterations to minimize adverse impacts and maintain the integrity and function of the natural channel. Streamflow, Turbidity and Water Quality\nProjects must keep impacts to water quality to a minimum, including potential effects of project materials used or removal of ground cover. Effects on Fish and Aquatic Habitat\nProjects must minimize adverse effects to fish and aquatic habitat. This includes criteria such as fish passage and bank\/streambed alterations that impair resource values. Avoid Harmful Flooding or Erosion\nProjects must avoid creating harmful flooding or erosion upstream or downstream. Minimize Vegetation Disturbance, Protect Existing Vegetation, Control Weeds\nProjects should seek to preserve, establish, or enhance native vegetation on the banks and floodplain. The Conservation District will consider whether there are modifications or alternative solutions that are reasonably practical that would reduce disturbance to the stream and its environment and better accomplish the goals of the project. Considerations When Planning Your Project\nStreams and rivers are complex systems and constantly undergo change. Their function is primarily to move water and sediment from the upstream watershed to points downstream. This may seem like a simple function, but the processes that the systems experience can be complex. There is a perpetual change to systems called dynamic equilibrium. To determine the cause and effect of channel changes, it’s important to understand the processes that govern stream systems. Projects need to be designed to work with the natural stream processes to maintain or improve balance in the system. Adequate project designs increase the potential for long-term benefits to the stream and to landowners. It is important to understand the limitations and the possible outcomes of different types of projects that a landowner may want to do on their property. Landowners should keep in mind that sometimes the best project is actually to do nothing at all. For more information on Stream Form and Function, including discussions on stream morphology, stream processes and more, please refer to the Montana Stream Permitting: A Guide for Conservation District Supervisors and Others. This guide discusses the various permits and permitting agencies in Montana, as well as:\n- Geology and Climate\n- Stream Channel Form\n- Bank and Channel Stability\n- Flow Characteristics\n- Field Indicators of Bankfull Flow\n- Channel Downcutting & Re-establishment of Equilibrium\n- Channel Migration Zones\n- Meander Movement and Bank Erosion\n- Role of Large Woody Debris\n- Role of Beaver Dams\n- And a Case Study of Big Spring Creek near Lewistown, Montana\n\nEstimate a how far downstream and b how far normal to the paper the effects of the intake are felt in the ambient 8-m-deep waters. The distance downstream from the sink is a and the distance normal to the paper is pa see Fig. Measured pressures at points A and B are kPa and 90 kPa, respectively, with uncertainties of 3 kPa each. Estimate the stream velocity and its uncertainty. Sketch the streamline and potential-line patterns. Solution: This is a double-image flow and creates two walls, as shown. Estimate b the appropriate source strength m and c the pressure at the nose of the body. Solution: We know, from Fig. If this tornado forms in sea-level standard air, at what radius will the local pressure be equivalent to 29 inHg? Solution: The vertical distance above the origin is a known multiple of m and a: Fig. Determine the relationship between the maximum bump height h and the source strength m. How does the bump height decrease with distance sufficiently far from the center? Find the resultant velocity induced by this pair at point A on the wall. Then we can sketch the source pair and the sink pair separately, as follows: You can see by symmetry that the new velocity normal to the wall is zero. Add up all the velocities to the right along the wall: 8. Sketch the resulting streamlines and note any stagnation points. What would the pattern look like from afar? Viewed from afar, the pattern would look like a single source of strength 3 m. Solution: a The straightforward, but unsatisfying, way to find length is to simply use Eq. What is the length? Estimate a the velocity at point A and b the location of point B where a particle approaching the stagnation point achieves its maximum deceleration. The numerical value of the maximum deceleration is P8. Sketch your ideas of the body contours that would arise if the sources were a very weak; and b very strong. If you have solved Prob.

At a section 2 m below the surface, estimate the lowest pressure on the surface of the keel. Solution: Assume standard sea level pressure of , Pa.\nFrom Table A. Compute the resulting pressure and surface velocity at a the stagnation points, and b the upper and lower shoulders. What will be the lift per meter of cylinder width? Solution: Recall that Prob. From Eq. There are 10 bolts per meter of width on each side, and the inside pressure is 50 kPa gage. Using potential theory for the outside pressure, compute the tension force in each bolt if the Fig. The intent is to use this cylinder as a stream velocimeter. The internal pressure is pi. حل كتاب Fox and McDonald’s Introduction to Fluid Mechanics 7th ed Solution Manual\n\nThe mixing of air and water, usually by bubbling air through water or by contact of water with air. The elevation that is used to help maintain a relative balance among tributary storage reservoirs. When water is drawn from tributary reservoirs, the balancing guide ensures that water is drawn equitably from each one, leaving the reservoirs at a similar position between the flood guide and the balancing guide. Cubic feet per second, typically used as a measure of flow in a stream. A cubic foot is equivalent to about 7.5 gallons. A measure of 1,000 cfs is equal to about 7,500 gallons of water per second. A marked nine-foot-draft navigation channel suitable for barge transportation on the Tennessee River and its tributaries. A measure of the volume of water accumulated at a flow rate of one cubic foot per second running for one day. A storage tank with a capacity of about 650,000 gallons would be required to store one day-second-foot of water. The oxygen dissolved in water that is necessary to sustain aquatic life. It is usually measured in milligrams per liter (mg\/L) or parts per million (ppm). In the direction of a stream's current\nThe process of lowering the water level in a reservoir. Drawdown is usually measured in feet. The spring period of lessening runoff, when reservoirs are filled at a rate designed to maintain flood storage and reach targeted summer pool elevations\nThe volume, or capacity, in a reservoir that is reserved for the storage of floodwater. Flood guide level\nThe elevation of a reservoir above which the space is reserved for temporary storage of water to help reduce downstream flooding. Water that is located under the surface of the earth. The upstream portion of a watershed. The water elevation immediately upstream of a dam. The study of the distribution and movement of water. The transfer of water out of one river basin for the benefit of a public water system in another river basin. In 2005, the 11 interbasin transfers from the Tennessee River watershed diverted 13.6 million gallons per day. The amount of electric power that is drawn from TVA’s electric system at a given point in time. An enclosed dam chamber with gates at each end that allow water to be admitted and released. The resulting change in water level allows vessels to be raised and lowered so they can pass over non-navigable parts of a river. The locks on the Tennessee River make navigation possible for 652 miles, from Knoxville, Tennessee, to Paducah, Kentucky. Main-river, or main-stem, reservoirs\nReservoirs where the seasonal lowering to provide storage for flood damage reduction is typically less than seven feet. Main-river reservoirs include (upstream to downstream) Fort Loudoun, Watts Bar, Chickamauga, Nickajack, Guntersville, Wheeler, Wilson, Pickwick, and Kentucky. They were designed to serve multiple purposes, especially commercial navigation and hydropower production. An amount of energy that equals one million watt-hours. It is a common measure for electricity use over time. A release from one or more dams provided to meet hydropower production, reservoir level targets, downstream water needs (such as aquatic habitat, water supply, and waste assimilation), and other commitments. Project minimum flows are those required to be released from a specific dam over a specific time period — not the lowest amount of water that TVA can pass through a dam. System minimum flows are those needed at some point in the system to meet specific needs for power, waste assimilation, navigation, and other beneficial uses. Minimum operations guide\nThe system minimum operations guide is a seasonal guide based on the sum of the storage in 10 tributary projects. It is used to determine what level of flow should be released from these projects when additional flow is required to meet downstream needs. Normal operating zone\nThe elevation range within which main-river reservoirs are operated for power production and summer mosquito control. During high-flow periods, the top of the normal operating zone may be exceeded for the regulation of flood flows. A set of guidelines that includes flood guides, minimum flow requirements, water release requirements, and other requirements to meet system operating objectives. Reservoir (pool) level\nThe elevation of the water in a reservoir at a given time, measured in feet above sea level. Reservoir Operations Study\nA study carried out by TVA to determine whether changes in its reservoir operating policies would produce greater overall public value.\n\nIt consists of the following tasks:\n- A practical (but limited) exercise, using supplied case study data for each of the 8 courses (2-9). - A final session where a case study from the student’s own region with the most complete data sets will be completed. This will allow the students to do a reasonably complete analysis of an existing watershed and apply what has been learned from the course. As appropriate, the student’s project may include any of the following tasks:\n- Preparing a Water Budget for a watershed\/sub-watershed either from a provided case study or one where the student can obtain information of on their own. - Doing a water demand analysis and future projection. - Performing and writing a report on a specific Risk Assessment. - Writing an Environmental Impact Assessment Statement. - Writing a contract for piece of work. - Evaluating one or more technology proposals. - Using one or more mathematical models to examine and evaluate a problem. - Draft a complete project (programming, identification, formulation, financing, implementation and evaluation) document\n- Writing a project grant\/loan proposal\n\nIn the spring of 2011, the Mississippi River swelled to historic levels, rising out of its banks, rolling across a wide flood plain, and eating at flood barriers. The story in 2012 could not be more different; the river has approached record-low levels in places. The contrast is illustrated in these two images, which show a stretch of the river just south of Memphis, Tennessee. Landsat 7 captured the top image on August 8, 2012, while Landsat 5 took the lower image on August 14, 2011. (The images are rotated so that north is to the left.) In the August 2011 image, the river was three months removed from the peak of the floods, and river gauges recorded levels close to normal for the month. In August 2012, water was several feet below the historic normal stage for Memphis, and many sandbars were newly exposed or greatly expanded. As of August 17, 2012, river gauges in the Memphis region recorded levels at -2.4 to -8.3 feet (below historic normal stage). At the time of the August 2011 image (lower), the river stage was 11.7 feet. (In May 2011, the river peaked at 56.6 feet in the same location.) The Mississippi River is a major North American transit route, carrying goods to and from ports in New Orleans and Baton Rogue. The top image shows that low water levels have narrowed the river from a superhighway to a small road. The U.S. Army Corp of Engineers maintains a 9-foot shipping channel in the lower Mississippi and has dredges working around the clock to keep the channel clear. Not only are water levels low in 2012, but the floods of 2011 dropped a layer of sediment on the riverbed, reshaping previously open channels. The reduced river flow in 2012 has translated into millions of dollars in extra shipping costs, as the loss of just one inch of draft means that a barge can carry 17 tons less than it otherwise would. The result is decreased shipping capacity. Reduced water levels had one positive impact: The U.S. Army Corp of Engineers has been able to access and repair levees that were damaged in last year’s floods. The levees are the tan lines that surround the river in these images. - Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service. (2012, August 17). Mississippi River at Memphis. NOAA National Weather Service.

The Hudson River flows through parts of eight different states in the United States before reaching its mouth at New York City on the east coast of North America. 10. Mississippi River Delta\nThe Mississippi River Delta is unique because of its size, shape, and location. It measures about 200 miles long and 85 miles across at its widest point, making it the largest river delta globally. The delta is also located at the mouth of the Mississippi River in North America, where it empties into the Bay of Bengal. The shape of the delta is fan-like, with slow-moving water that spreads out into distributaries as it meets wetlands and other bodies of water. Endowed with rich nutrients from sand and sediment picked up from upstream sources, this unique ecosystem provides breeding grounds for hundreds of species of fish and birds. How to find out the source and mouth of a river? Step 1: Research the river’s source\n1. Research the location of the river, its source, and its mouth. Find out if it is a lake, a marsh, a spring, or a glacier that begins the stream. 2. Research what type of terrain surrounds the source of the river to determine if there is enough water for it to flow continuously downhill towards its estuary or confluence with another river or stream. 3. Find out if there are any natural processes that could affect this terrain and cause changes in water levels over time (for example, climate change). 4. Research how human activity has affected this area over time (for example, deforestation). 5. Analyze all of your findings to gain an understanding of how these factors impact the flow of water in this particular region and how they might influence changes in future years that end up affecting the source or mouth of this particular river system\nStep 2: Find out the final destination of the river\n1. Identify the source of the river. This is where the stream starts and is usually located in a mountain range or highlands. 2. Follow the river downstream to find out where it empties into a larger body of water, such as a lake or ocean. This is called its mouth or confluence point with another river or stream. 3. If needed, use maps and other geographical tools to locate where it meets its end destination at its mouth or confluence point with another river\/stream. For example, if you were tracking down how far the Mississippi River flows from its source to its mouth, you would first need to identify where it begins (the source). From there, you could follow it downstream until it reaches Baton Rouge in Louisiana before emptying into the Gulf of Mexico. Step 3: Read about the geography of the region\nReading about the geography of a region can help you identify the source and mouth of a river. Knowing the landforms, cultural influences, and other geographical features of an area can help you determine where rivers originate from and where they end up. For example, if you know that a river flows through mountainous terrain with many waterfalls, it is likely that it originated high in the mountains. Similarly, if a river flows into an ocean or another large body of water at its mouth, then it likely ends there. Understanding these relationships between rivers and their environments can help you locate their sources or mouths more easily. Step 4: Research the kinds of terrain present in the region\nWhen trying to find out the source and mouth of a river, you should research terrains such as low foothills, valleys, mountain forests, and desert canyons. These different types of terrain provide clues about where rivers may start or end. For example, low foothills provide an ideal location for a river’s source since they are higher than surrounding land and allow meltwater to collect. Similarly, deserts provide an ideal location for a river’s mouth since they are lower than surrounding land allowing water to flow out more easily. Step 5: Look up information on the infrastructure available there\nAlong a river, infrastructure typically includes water treatment plants, bridges, docks and piers for boats and ships, wastewater treatment facilities, and pumping stations. In some areas, hydroelectric power plants may also be present along rivers.\n\n### Question: What specific impacts are expected at the 42-foot water level of the Cumberland River in Nashville?","passages":[{"passage":"Thursday, Feb 21 – According to the NOAA and their Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service, the Cumberland River is currently at a level of 36.34’.

Businesses or buildings with underground garages or structures should take precautions. The Cumberland River's flood stage is 40 feet in downtown Nashville. On Saturday night, the Cumberland River's water level was at 39.59 feet, according to NWS data. It's expected to hit 43.8 feet by Sunday evening. According to the NWS, at 42 feet, Riverfront Park is flooded to the fourth grassy area, as well as other recreational and greenway areas along the river. Portions of Cowan Street and Cowan Court are flooded and may be impassable. Industrial properties on Davidson Street, North First Street, Cowan Street and Cowan Court are also flooded. In May 2010 during Nashville's devastating floods, the Cumberland River crested at 52 feet. This story is being provided free to all readers as a public service by The Tennessean.

The city of New Orleans is a US city with a long history. One of the oldest cities in the US, New Orleans has become known as a cultural melting pot with a unique culture and cuisine. New Orleans is home to a rich culture, famous for their festivals, such as Mardi Gras, and is also known as the birthplace of jazz. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused considerable damage to the city of New Orleans. Many of the city's levees broke which caused water levels to rise, leaving much of the city underwater. In the events of global warming, New Orleans faces the danger of becoming submerged under the waters of the Gulf of Mexico once again. Zoom in on the city of New Orleans to zoom level 7. Have students locate New Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico. 2. On the Hazard Map, adjust the the sea levels from 0 meters to 1 meter. How is the city affected? At 5 meters sea level rise? 10 meters sea level rise? 20 meters? 3. Explain to students that if the sea levels of the world rise, the water will first flood the parts of the city with the lowest elevation. Elevation is the height of the land above the level of the sea. Rising sea levels would first affect coastal areas with low elevation. Extension for advanced students and high grade levels:\n4. Here is a map of New Orlean's elevations\nHow do the areas on this map correspond to the flooded areas in the CyArk Hazard Map? How does elevation play a role in sea level rise? How will melting glacial ice from Antarctica and Greenland affect sea levels? Find the list of materials above. Choose one of two methods below:\n1. Fill ziplock bags with water. 2. Place ziplock bags flat in the freezer and let freeze. 3. When the water has completely frozen into ice, remove the ice from the ziplock bag. You should now have a small, flat sheet of ice. 1. Using ice cubes, place about 6 ice cubes in a small container or ziplock bag. 2. Wet the ice cubes slightly and then place in the freezer. 3. Remove the ice cubes after they have frozen together to form a block of several ice cubes stuck together. 1. Fill a small plastic container with rocks or gravel. Alternatively, a small, unopened can (such as a tuna can) be be used. The container of choice should be relatively heavy to prevent the container from floating in water. This container will represent a continent or island. Place the weighted container in a large shallow pan. 2. Using sugar cubes and glue, have students construct a small city on top of the \"island.\" 3. Place another weighed container or can in the shallow pan. Place a large block of ice on top of the the weighed container. This will represent Antarctica and its thick layer of ice. 4. Using a pitcher, slowly fill the pan with water. Fill the container until the the water level reaches the top of the small container \"islands.\" Be careful not to splash water on the sugar cubes. 5. Measure the height of the water level in the pan with a ruler. Students should record the water level in their notebooks and record any observations about their sugar cube city. At this time students will write their predictions and hypothesis of what will happen as the ice cubes melt and what effect it will have on the sugar cube city. Optional: have students record their sugar cube city with a digital camera. 6. Direct the lamp towards the ice cubes in the container. The lamp represent solar activity and melts the ice cubes at a faster rate. 7. Once the sugar cubes have melted, students should measure the new water level with a ruler and record this number in their notebooks. Students should also record their observations on the sugar cube city. What happened to the city after the ice cubes melted? Did the level of the water rise? If so, by how much? Optional: have students photograph the sugar cube city after the ice melted. IV. Global Warming's Impact\nUsing the CyArk Hazard map (linked above) have students explore a local coastal town.

Stream Channel Alteration\nSupervisors must review the effects of stream channel alterations to minimize adverse impacts and maintain the integrity and function of the natural channel. Streamflow, Turbidity and Water Quality\nProjects must keep impacts to water quality to a minimum, including potential effects of project materials used or removal of ground cover. Effects on Fish and Aquatic Habitat\nProjects must minimize adverse effects to fish and aquatic habitat. This includes criteria such as fish passage and bank\/streambed alterations that impair resource values. Avoid Harmful Flooding or Erosion\nProjects must avoid creating harmful flooding or erosion upstream or downstream. Minimize Vegetation Disturbance, Protect Existing Vegetation, Control Weeds\nProjects should seek to preserve, establish, or enhance native vegetation on the banks and floodplain. The Conservation District will consider whether there are modifications or alternative solutions that are reasonably practical that would reduce disturbance to the stream and its environment and better accomplish the goals of the project. Considerations When Planning Your Project\nStreams and rivers are complex systems and constantly undergo change. Their function is primarily to move water and sediment from the upstream watershed to points downstream. This may seem like a simple function, but the processes that the systems experience can be complex. There is a perpetual change to systems called dynamic equilibrium. To determine the cause and effect of channel changes, it’s important to understand the processes that govern stream systems. Projects need to be designed to work with the natural stream processes to maintain or improve balance in the system. Adequate project designs increase the potential for long-term benefits to the stream and to landowners. It is important to understand the limitations and the possible outcomes of different types of projects that a landowner may want to do on their property. Landowners should keep in mind that sometimes the best project is actually to do nothing at all.

The story in 2012 could not be more different; the river has approached record-low levels in places. The contrast is illustrated in these two images, which show a stretch of the river just south of Memphis, Tennessee. Landsat 7 captured the top image on August 8, 2012, while Landsat 5 took the lower image on August 14, 2011. (The images are rotated so that north is to the left.) In the August 2011 image, the river was three months removed from the peak of the floods, and river gauges recorded levels close to normal for the month. In August 2012, water was several feet below the historic normal stage for Memphis, and many sandbars were newly exposed or greatly expanded. As of August 17, 2012, river gauges in the Memphis region recorded levels at -2.4 to -8.3 feet (below historic normal stage). At the time of the August 2011 image (lower), the river stage was 11.7 feet. (In May 2011, the river peaked at 56.6 feet in the same location.) The Mississippi River is a major North American transit route, carrying goods to and from ports in New Orleans and Baton Rogue. The top image shows that low water levels have narrowed the river from a superhighway to a small road. The U.S. Army Corp of Engineers maintains a 9-foot shipping channel in the lower Mississippi and has dredges working around the clock to keep the channel clear. Not only are water levels low in 2012, but the floods of 2011 dropped a layer of sediment on the riverbed, reshaping previously open channels. The reduced river flow in 2012 has translated into millions of dollars in extra shipping costs, as the loss of just one inch of draft means that a barge can carry 17 tons less than it otherwise would. The result is decreased shipping capacity. Reduced water levels had one positive impact: The U.S. Army Corp of Engineers has been able to access and repair levees that were damaged in last year’s floods.

The Hudson River flows through parts of eight different states in the United States before reaching its mouth at New York City on the east coast of North America. 10. Mississippi River Delta\nThe Mississippi River Delta is unique because of its size, shape, and location. It measures about 200 miles long and 85 miles across at its widest point, making it the largest river delta globally. The delta is also located at the mouth of the Mississippi River in North America, where it empties into the Bay of Bengal. The shape of the delta is fan-like, with slow-moving water that spreads out into distributaries as it meets wetlands and other bodies of water. Endowed with rich nutrients from sand and sediment picked up from upstream sources, this unique ecosystem provides breeding grounds for hundreds of species of fish and birds. How to find out the source and mouth of a river? Step 1: Research the river’s source\n1. Research the location of the river, its source, and its mouth. Find out if it is a lake, a marsh, a spring, or a glacier that begins the stream. 2. Research what type of terrain surrounds the source of the river to determine if there is enough water for it to flow continuously downhill towards its estuary or confluence with another river or stream. 3. Find out if there are any natural processes that could affect this terrain and cause changes in water levels over time (for example, climate change). 4. Research how human activity has affected this area over time (for example, deforestation). 5. Analyze all of your findings to gain an understanding of how these factors impact the flow of water in this particular region and how they might influence changes in future years that end up affecting the source or mouth of this particular river system\nStep 2: Find out the final destination of the river\n1. Identify the source of the river. This is where the stream starts and is usually located in a mountain range or highlands. 2. Follow the river downstream to find out where it empties into a larger body of water, such as a lake or ocean. This is called its mouth or confluence point with another river or stream. 3. If needed, use maps and other geographical tools to locate where it meets its end destination at its mouth or confluence point with another river\/stream. For example, if you were tracking down how far the Mississippi River flows from its source to its mouth, you would first need to identify where it begins (the source). From there, you could follow it downstream until it reaches Baton Rouge in Louisiana before emptying into the Gulf of Mexico. Step 3: Read about the geography of the region\nReading about the geography of a region can help you identify the source and mouth of a river. Knowing the landforms, cultural influences, and other geographical features of an area can help you determine where rivers originate from and where they end up. For example, if you know that a river flows through mountainous terrain with many waterfalls, it is likely that it originated high in the mountains. Similarly, if a river flows into an ocean or another large body of water at its mouth, then it likely ends there. Understanding these relationships between rivers and their environments can help you locate their sources or mouths more easily. Step 4: Research the kinds of terrain present in the region\nWhen trying to find out the source and mouth of a river, you should research terrains such as low foothills, valleys, mountain forests, and desert canyons. These different types of terrain provide clues about where rivers may start or end. For example, low foothills provide an ideal location for a river’s source since they are higher than surrounding land and allow meltwater to collect. Similarly, deserts provide an ideal location for a river’s mouth since they are lower than surrounding land allowing water to flow out more easily. Step 5: Look up information on the infrastructure available there\nAlong a river, infrastructure typically includes water treatment plants, bridges, docks and piers for boats and ships, wastewater treatment facilities, and pumping stations. In some areas, hydroelectric power plants may also be present along rivers.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:1e5c4bc6-ab76-468f-b721-c7af8113f96e>"]}]}

For energy management systems, that aim to optimise the energy usage of a building or home, this variable pattern of usage is one of the many factors that it needs to consider for functioning properly. This is where Customer Energy Manager, or simply CEM, comes in. CEM is the key component that lends flexibility to the whole energy management system. It consists of a logical function that compiles together the customer’s preferred configuration, the devices in the building or home, the grid, and any other additional settings. It then makes the decision of how to optimise energy generation or consumption based on these inputs. To elaborate, the CEM gathers information about all the energy outlets on their energy needs for a certain period of time. The energy outlets could be household appliances such as refrigerators, lighting, heat pumps and water heaters or office equipment such as printing machines, HVAC, and security functions. However, apart from the energy consumers, it also consults the energy producers or sources such as photovoltaic systems, energy storage systems or electric vehicle charging stations. By comparing and understanding the energy profiles of these energy outlets and sources, the CEM can then be optimised using the information on expected available energy and price offers for the stipulated time period. This is done by creating graphs of energy vs time that lines up slots next to each other. Each slot defines the amount of energy required during the period. The CEM is then not only looking to distribute energy in a non-interruptive way but also optimising the expenses that the energy usage will incur. As the CEM not only has the information about the internal environment and preferences of the customers but also has signals from the grid that it is connected to which provides information about the varying energy pricing. Considering the time of the day, energy generation, energy requirements, energy rates, and many other factors, the CEM utilises its logic function that will efficiently allocate the energy in a non-interruptive fashion with an aim to bring down the dependency on external sources as much as possible, thus lowering the energy expenses. Moreover, since the CEM can also recognize the load on the smart power grid with its peak and low times, it will make sure that the entire network is also not overburdened. Thus, a CEM is also a key player in improving the overall efficiency and stability of the entire grid. As the CEM collects information on all the energy outlets, sources, and generators within a building or home, it is best suited to play a key role in load management, as a central decision-maker or suggestion-provider for load adaptions. It can take up the task of evaluating tariff-based management and generation management. The CEM sits at the intersection of the internal environment of infrastructure and its external environment by being connected to the energy grid. This allows it to play a pivotal role in Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) and Building Energy Management Systems (BEMS) to provide the optimal energy performance.\n\nEnergy management refers to saving energy in organizations, private homes, public spaces, and government associations. In particular, it is the path to the observation, control, and preservation of energy in a structure or association. Generally, this term applies to existing systems and equipment and the discovery of approaches to make these current resources more competent. Energy management isn’t just about saving money, despite being a key segment for organizations and real estate owners. There is also a global need to preserve, reduce our carbon footprint, and ensure that we abandon a sustainable future. By putting energy management solutions systems in place, organizations can show signs of improving cost containment, finding new doors for efficiency, reducing danger, and making smarter choices. Organizing long term energy is becoming an essential part of many organizations. With declining measurements of petroleum products and increasing reliance on new energy supplies, reducing our energy use is a way for an organization to add to the grid and the climate that is useful for all. A few organizations have started to update a situation for an energy management specialist to discover approaches to reduce their use. These stations can do things, for example, measure energy use and collect information; find approaches to saving and assess how much each activity would save; suggesting and acting on these possible chances; and finally investigate and monitor progress on how each of these activities has spared the organization’s accounts. Part of the serious tasks that one can handle is remembering collecting information about current energy use and finding points of interest in day-to-day use from time to time every hour. Tracking routine waste makes it easy to start saving energy. Once usage has been investigated and distinguished areas where an organization can improve energy conservation, action should be taken to achieve a predetermined goal. These activities should be organized by the specialist and capable of being quantified to ensure that progress is made. Some activities can be as necessary as mentioning and updating reps to kill their PCs and lighting their workspaces when they leave each night.

Energy Audit\nAn energy audit is an essential first step in any energy management plan. It involves a comprehensive evaluation of a building or facility’s energy usage and identifies areas of improvement. Energy auditors assess factors such as insulation, equipment efficiency, lighting systems, HVAC systems, and more. Based on the findings, they provide recommendations for energy-efficient upgrades and modifications. Some common recommendations that may come out of an energy audit include:\n2. Energy-Efficient Equipment\nAnother important aspect of effective energy management is the use of energy-efficient equipment. From office appliances to manufacturing machinery, using energy-efficient models can significantly reduce energy consumption. When choosing equipment, look for the ENERGY STAR label, which indicates that the product meets strict energy efficiency guidelines set by the Environmental Protection Agency. Replacing outdated equipment with energy-efficient alternatives not only reduces energy usage but also improves performance and productivity. For example, upgrading to energy-efficient computers and monitors can result in substantial electricity savings for businesses. Similarly, using energy-efficient industrial machinery can reduce operational costs and improve overall production efficiency. 3. Renewable Energy Sources\nTransitioning to renewable energy sources is a crucial step towards achieving sustainable energy management. Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power, have a significantly lower environmental impact compared to fossil fuel-based energy sources. By harnessing these clean and renewable energy sources, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote a greener future. Businesses and homeowners can install solar panels on their rooftops to generate clean energy. In many cases, excess energy can be fed back into the grid, allowing users to earn credits or receive compensation for their contribution to the renewable energy supply. Additionally, some regions offer incentives and tax credits to encourage the adoption of renewable energy systems. 4. Energy Monitoring and Automation\nReal-time energy monitoring and automation play a vital role in effective energy management. Energy monitoring systems allow businesses and individuals to track their energy usage, identify patterns, and make informed decisions to reduce consumption. By understanding when and how energy is used, users can implement targeted energy-saving measures. Automation systems, such as smart thermostats and occupancy sensors, can optimize energy usage by adjusting settings based on occupancy and environmental conditions. For example, smart thermostats can automatically adjust temperature settings when no one is present, minimizing energy waste. 5. Employee Engagement and Education\nOne often overlooked aspect of energy management is employee engagement and education. Employers can encourage their employees to adopt energy-saving habits and practices in the workplace. Simple actions like turning off lights when leaving a room, unplugging idle electronics, and using energy-efficient equipment can go a long way in reducing energy consumption. Training programs and educational materials can help raise awareness about the importance of energy management and provide practical tips on how to reduce energy usage. By involving employees in the energy management process, businesses can create a culture of sustainability and achieve significant energy savings. In conclusion, effective energy management solutions are crucial for a sustainable future. By conducting energy audits, using energy-efficient equipment, harnessing renewable energy sources, implementing energy monitoring and automation systems, and engaging employees, we can optimize energy usage, reduce costs, and minimize our environmental impact. Embracing these solutions not only benefits individual businesses and homeowners but also contributes to building a greener and more sustainable world for future generations.

Improving Energy Efficiency\nImproving energy efficiency takes different forms. The first form is an innovation that can lead to equal or greater output with less energy. The second form involves cutting out the energy that go to waste. Cutting out energy that goes to waste reduces energy needed for industrial purposes while maintaining the same level of output. The third is employing heating technologies that can deliver greater output for minimal supplier energy. The creation of innovative investment mechanism allows for accelerated technology deployment. Innovative ideas have been implemented through network of regional cleaning energy technology centers to hasten the spread of locally appropriate energy technologies. Managing through best practices can also improve energy efficiency if the top management of the firm incorporates the goals of the firm that relate to efficient energy use into the strategic business plan. The current business atmosphere that enhances principle of downsizing and reduction of capital expenditure provides a good basis for efficient energy management. Senior managers concern themselves with ensuring maximizing the return on investment. The focus presents the energy managers with an opportunity to demonstrate energy efficiency as a factor that can contribute to maximizing the return on investment. Efficiency can be achieved when the energy managers gain the attention of the top management and make them understand that an efficient operation should form part of asset management in order to reduce the operating cost. Further, the firm must develop an energy management plan. The plan must incorporate energy efficient operation as a primary component. Therefore, the firm will run an energy-consuming device to use as much energy as necessary to fulfill the intended function. Management must ensure that the use of energy does not lead to uncomfortable and unsafe environment. To achieve efficient energy planning, the firm must buy clean and reliable energy at the lowest cost, replacing the old equipment with the new one, and ensuring that the equipment is operated in an efficient manner. Energy accounting is also one of the limbs of best practices in enhancing efficient energy use. The firm seeking to achieve efficient energy use must create an accounting system in which it can use to locate savings, opportunities and to track and measure the success of the energy efficient practices. In the management plan, energy accounting is a very important component. It allows the firm to keep records of its past and current state on energy use. The information enables the energy manager to communicate in a measurable way about the development of the energy management within the firm. The main purpose of energy accounting is that it provides a foundation for strong energy administration plan; records and tracks the progress of energy saving strategies and provides a platform for setting realistic energy savings. Energy accounting allows the firm to record possible areas that need improvement in the future. The person in charge of the control of the industrial plant energy sector must ensure that he or she undertakes certain general practices that will promote energy efficiency promotion. Therefore, he or she must ensure that regular audits are taken from the condition of the plant and regular reports are made accordingly. Principles of Implementation\nEffective implementation of the energy efficiency programs requires certain candid consideration to the implementation guiding principles. These principles provide a process-like-approach that industries willing to manage the use of energy should adopt in order to achieve greater efficiency. The first step is to integrate key processes to promote the implementation of identified saving opportunities. In participating in the assessment processes, the personnel must be ready for the project implementation. The second step is to assign the completion of a specific project to specific individuals. The assigning of roles must take place after an internal approval has been conducted for each participating individual. Internal approval gives an assurance that the persons selected shall commit themselves fully to the demand of the project. The implementation requires that participating people are assigned specific duty and accorded specific role. Understanding the project expectation is important for the participant since it allows for the participation to the highest level. To achieve the required level of involvement, the participants must be given handouts to act as reference documents. Energy managers, plant managers, and other staff included in the process must be conscious of each person’s role and the way they fit into the overall demands of the project. The third principle demands that the implications and performance of the project assessment are communicated clearly and comprehensively to the people involved. Business case for implementation must be set from the onset of the planning process.\n\nMost building owners and facility managers recognize the need to track and manage energy use. Irrespective of the source (electricity, gas or oil), the efficient and effective use of energy has a direct impact on the economic bottom line. While corporations with multiple properties may employ an energy manager to oversee these efforts (often as part of a larger sustainability plan), smaller companies may rely on O&M groups, or engage third-party consultants, for energy audits of their building systems. While these approaches may be productive, many public and private clients recognize a need for a more comprehensive energy master plan, establishing short- and long-term goals in their approaches to energy. An energy roadmap takes a more comprehensive approach for the client, examining a number of issues associated with the client’s energy demand, procurement, use and security. Discussions are held with current utility providers regarding their generating capacity, growth in demand, projected fuel costs and legislative forecasts that may have an affect on their industry. In addition, system reliability and security are discussed, allowing the client to evaluate a need for redundant or stand-by capacity. Internally, clients evaluate their procedures for benchmarking and tracking energy use in their facilities, comparing against local and national indices. They can establish targets for reduction in consumption and demand, and monitoring mechanisms that may employ trend logs and sub-metering. Results from these initial efforts will identify target facilities and\/or systems for further auditing and\/or retro-commissioning. An energy roadmap can establish the methodology for prioritizing and implementing an energy conservation program, incorporating a variety of measures to improve (and maintain) system performance, as well as establish policies to be followed by O&M personnel, occupants and tenants. These methodologies and priorities can vary between clients, necessitating the tailoring of energy roadmaps according to each client’s particular situation and goals. Finally, it is important to integrate a client’s energy roadmap with any other plans, initiatives or budget constraints. For example, if the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is a major goal or the incorporation of on-site renewables (solar photovoltaic system, cogeneration, etc.) is important, then the energy roadmap must address and accommodate these requirements.

A successful program is incorporated into the mission of the organization and training of its employees. Restaurants are notorious for abusing equipment and maintaining equipment only when something goes wrong. A regular, documented cleaning and maintenance schedule will help keep equipment running longer and more efficiently. A refrigerator with dirty coils uses up to 23% more energy, 11% more with a bad door seal and up to a 100% with a refrigerant leak. To fix problems like these create a schedule of weekly, monthly and annual dates to calibrate, clean and inspect all the equipment in the house. The Tools page contains a sample maintenance schedule and repair log. Timely upgrades are also a piece of an energy efficiency program. Old equipment may be so inefficient that upgrading to energy efficient equipment may be a more cost effective solution rather than repairing, even in the short run. It is a good idea to investigate energy efficient alternatives for all the facility�s equipment so if a piece of equipment dies you are not left scrambling to find an efficient replacement or wind up with another standard efficiency unit. The Lighting page covers many energy efficient lighting options for foodservice facilities.

This would be the responsibility of the building’s energy modeler or commissioning agent. In the long term, this responsibility shifts to the building controls engineers and operators to review continuous improvement that is made possible with the use of M&V when included in the green building tools. 4.) Help environment and climate-friendly initiatives\nResidential and commercial buildings account for almost 39 percent of total U.S. energy consumption and 38 percent of U.S. carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Nearly all of these greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the residential and commercial sectors can be attributed to energy use in buildings. As green house gas emissions increase, they build up in the atmosphere and affect the global warming and the climate change impact can persist over a long time. This can adversely impact society, plants and animals. Hence there is an increased focus on reducing these gases and the need for environment and climate-friendly initiatives and the need for sustainable building technology. M&V process is the only standard that is used across most countries to establish energy efficient building design and hence can be used to determine the impact that energy consumption has on the environment and climate change. 5.) Policy and public expenditure\nUnited Nations Environment Programme ,as part of MCA4climate, is a new initiative providing practical assistance to governments in preparing their climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. According to the 2007 international legal climate regime Bali Action Plan, a requirement for all countries was made. This meant that all countries’ climate control plans to be “measurable, reportable and verifiable”. This would be fulfilled by Measurement, reporting and verification (MRV), a protocol of M&V. This process of measurement can help national climatic and energy strategies by establishing baselines and helping to identify policies and potentials. The M&V reports are published internationally and can be used to solicit expert advice on improvement. 6.) Reduce and manage risk\nThe goal of any energy savings project is to guarantee cost and energy savings and reduce the risk of nonperformance at an acceptable level. The risk of handling the uncertainty of the expected savings and the potential financial consequences is the responsibility of both the ESCO (Energy Service Company) and the customer. Due to the involvement of multiple parties, any project using M&V has to complete the project responsibility matrix. This includes the risk, responsibilities and performance required for the project to be a success. In addition, this matrix helps identify important project risks, potential implications, mitigation plans and parties responsible for managing it. Using M&V responsibility matrix would ensure that the selection, application, design, installation and performance of the equipment and the preventive maintenance goals are met. 7.) Demand response for consumer consumption\nDemand response programs are programs that provide consumers payment incentives if consumers reduce their consumption during peak periods. M&V plans can be utilized for optimizing the consumption to avail these benefits. It can also be used to calculate savings utilizing engineering algorithms to determine a baseline from which the savings are derived. 8.) Renewable energy efficiency\nThe energy needed to run commercial and industrial buildings in the United States produces 19 percent of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, 12 percent of nitrogen oxides, and 25 percent of sulfur dioxide, at a cost of $110 billion a year. These are mostly generated by fossil fuel. This has led to alternate energy sources like solar, wind, biomass etc. that come under the term “renewable energy”. Renewable energy sources are different from regular energy sources since their productivity is directly linked to the amount of energy consumed as they are supplied by request and cannot be produced in excess. An M&V approach should be carefully structured to consider the generating capacity of the renewable energy source as well as the redundancy processes in place. This M&V plan would help in providing greater confidence that the benefits of renewable energy investments are actually being realized. 9.) Energy Saving Certificates (ESC)\nOne of the important goals of commercial building energy efficiency is to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy costs. Energy saving certificates (ESCs) is an effective tool for meeting these goals. These certificates are used as a mechanism through which commercial buildings can comply with energy efficiency targets.\n\nRestaurants are the most energy intensive commercial buildings in the United States according to the Energy Information Administration. Restaurants, per square foot, consume nearly three times the energy of the average commercial building. Long hours of operation, specialized equipment and sheer demand make up much of the substantial consumption, but overall the energy consumption by foodservice buildings is excessive and often wasteful. Along the same lines, groceries are also major energy consumers among commercial buildings. Food sales buildings are the second most energy intensive buildings with around 50% of energy use going to refrigeration alone. Not surprising, the largest portion of energy use is consumed by cooking and food preparation, followed closely by heating, ventilation and cooling as a whole (HVAC). The pie graph to the right shows the average breakdown of energy use at foodservice operations. The graphs below show energy per square foot and annual energy use in terms of cost in dollars per square foot. Utilities consume approximately 2.5 to 3.4 percent of total restaurant sales, depending on the type of operation (source: National Restaurant Association 2004 Restaurant Industry Operations Report). While this seems like a relatively low expenditure, energy efficiency is a very cost effective measure. A $1 reduction in energy costs equals $12.50 in sales at an 8% profit margin. There is no need to increase sales, table turnover or your profit margin with efficiency. Many energy conservation efforts require little to no cost, but major changes in habit. Most other efficiency measures demand new equipment or technology that promise returns on investment in as little time as overnight. Practices and Policies\nPossibly the single most important energy conservation effort is human habit. Energy efficient equipment does not save energy if it is not used correctly or properly maintained. Energy conservation must be integrated into the training and daily activities of all staff to ensure successful sustainability efforts. Comprehensive Energy Management (CEM)\nA CEM program measures every watt of energy used in a facility, then implements sustainability programs or updates equipment and facilities to reduce energy consumption. The first step of implementing CEM is to measure and record energy use so you can document progress and determine what measures have been most effective. The easiest, most affordable option is to track energy bills and enter usage into a spreadsheet to compare and graph data. There is an energy use tracking tool on the Tools page that can compare and track electric and gas usage for multiple facilities. More comprehensive software programs like Portfolio Manager from the Energy Star program track and assess energy and water use then compare that data with other buildings in the same industry. Portfolio Manager helps compare resource costs, find effective facility improvements, compare multiple facilities and track energy management progress. The software is free and available on-line. A more detailed and very useful option is an interval data collection system that connects to an electric or gas meter and track energy use at set, time-stamped intervals, usually every 30 minutes. These systems are very useful in that you can see energy use rise and fall throughout the day in various graphs and use that information to change practices, startup times or track down energy use problems. For example, your HVAC company recently serviced one large air conditioner, but did not properly reset the unit to your previous configuration. As a result, the unit cycles on all night, seven days a week and the next months bill is higher than average. Without a data tracking system, the only way to discover this is to be in the restaurant at some point in the middle of the night. With the data collection system, you can not only see the energy use increase the day after the HVAC company serviced the air conditioning unit, but also see each time the A\/C unit cycled on overnight. These systems provide on-line access to energy use and a range of tools for comparing and benchmarking the data. Interval data collection systems are available through many utilities and third-party companies for a monthly or one time fee. They are highly recommended for large facilities. With or without a tracking system, a CEM program looks at everything from equipment types and placement to thermostat settings, employee habits and ways to avoid peak load costs. For example, if your operation can make it though working hours without making additional ice it may be an effective solution to set the icemaker to run overnight to decrease load charges. One of the simplest methods for reducing energy use is creating an energy checklist that schedules start-up and shutdown times for lighting and equipment so they are turned on only when needed, turned down during slow periods and turned off when not needed. There are literally thousands of ways to reduce energy, but no one CEM solution for all organizations.\n\n### Question: What are the main responsibilities of a Certified Energy Manager (CEM) in facilities and buildings?","passages":[{"passage":"02 Dec A Guide Customer Energy Manager (CEM)\nA building or home has its own energy consumption behaviour that is not only unique to the inhabitant habits, but also dependent on the devices or equipment within. For energy management systems, that aim to optimise the energy usage of a building or home, this variable pattern of usage is one of the many factors that it needs to consider for functioning properly. This is where Customer Energy Manager, or simply CEM, comes in. CEM is the key component that lends flexibility to the whole energy management system. It consists of a logical function that compiles together the customer’s preferred configuration, the devices in the building or home, the grid, and any other additional settings. It then makes the decision of how to optimise energy generation or consumption based on these inputs. To elaborate, the CEM gathers information about all the energy outlets on their energy needs for a certain period of time. The energy outlets could be household appliances such as refrigerators, lighting, heat pumps and water heaters or office equipment such as printing machines, HVAC, and security functions. However, apart from the energy consumers, it also consults the energy producers or sources such as photovoltaic systems, energy storage systems or electric vehicle charging stations. By comparing and understanding the energy profiles of these energy outlets and sources, the CEM can then be optimised using the information on expected available energy and price offers for the stipulated time period. This is done by creating graphs of energy vs time that lines up slots next to each other. Each slot defines the amount of energy required during the period. The CEM is then not only looking to distribute energy in a non-interruptive way but also optimising the expenses that the energy usage will incur. As the CEM not only has the information about the internal environment and preferences of the customers but also has signals from the grid that it is connected to which provides information about the varying energy pricing. Considering the time of the day, energy generation, energy requirements, energy rates, and many other factors, the CEM utilises its logic function that will efficiently allocate the energy in a non-interruptive fashion with an aim to bring down the dependency on external sources as much as possible, thus lowering the energy expenses. Moreover, since the CEM can also recognize the load on the smart power grid with its peak and low times, it will make sure that the entire network is also not overburdened. Thus, a CEM is also a key player in improving the overall efficiency and stability of the entire grid. As the CEM collects information on all the energy outlets, sources, and generators within a building or home, it is best suited to play a key role in load management, as a central decision-maker or suggestion-provider for load adaptions. It can take up the task of evaluating tariff-based management and generation management. The CEM sits at the intersection of the internal environment of infrastructure and its external environment by being connected to the energy grid. This allows it to play a pivotal role in Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) and Building Energy Management Systems (BEMS) to provide the optimal energy performance.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:202f4529-9dfd-4cbc-8d9d-3980fff3bc2c>"]},{"passage":"Energy management refers to saving energy in organizations, private homes, public spaces, and government associations. In particular, it is the path to the observation, control, and preservation of energy in a structure or association. Generally, this term applies to existing systems and equipment and the discovery of approaches to make these current resources more competent. Energy management isn’t just about saving money, despite being a key segment for organizations and real estate owners. There is also a global need to preserve, reduce our carbon footprint, and ensure that we abandon a sustainable future. By putting energy management solutions systems in place, organizations can show signs of improving cost containment, finding new doors for efficiency, reducing danger, and making smarter choices. Organizing long term energy is becoming an essential part of many organizations. With declining measurements of petroleum products and increasing reliance on new energy supplies, reducing our energy use is a way for an organization to add to the grid and the climate that is useful for all. A few organizations have started to update a situation for an energy management specialist to discover approaches to reduce their use. These stations can do things, for example, measure energy use and collect information; find approaches to saving and assess how much each activity would save; suggesting and acting on these possible chances; and finally investigate and monitor progress on how each of these activities has spared the organization’s accounts. Part of the serious tasks that one can handle is remembering collecting information about current energy use and finding points of interest in day-to-day use from time to time every hour. Tracking routine waste makes it easy to start saving energy. Once usage has been investigated and distinguished areas where an organization can improve energy conservation, action should be taken to achieve a predetermined goal. These activities should be organized by the specialist and capable of being quantified to ensure that progress is made.

Improving Energy Efficiency\nImproving energy efficiency takes different forms. The first form is an innovation that can lead to equal or greater output with less energy. The second form involves cutting out the energy that go to waste. Cutting out energy that goes to waste reduces energy needed for industrial purposes while maintaining the same level of output. The third is employing heating technologies that can deliver greater output for minimal supplier energy. The creation of innovative investment mechanism allows for accelerated technology deployment. Innovative ideas have been implemented through network of regional cleaning energy technology centers to hasten the spread of locally appropriate energy technologies. Managing through best practices can also improve energy efficiency if the top management of the firm incorporates the goals of the firm that relate to efficient energy use into the strategic business plan. The current business atmosphere that enhances principle of downsizing and reduction of capital expenditure provides a good basis for efficient energy management. Senior managers concern themselves with ensuring maximizing the return on investment. The focus presents the energy managers with an opportunity to demonstrate energy efficiency as a factor that can contribute to maximizing the return on investment. Efficiency can be achieved when the energy managers gain the attention of the top management and make them understand that an efficient operation should form part of asset management in order to reduce the operating cost. Further, the firm must develop an energy management plan. The plan must incorporate energy efficient operation as a primary component. Therefore, the firm will run an energy-consuming device to use as much energy as necessary to fulfill the intended function. Management must ensure that the use of energy does not lead to uncomfortable and unsafe environment. To achieve efficient energy planning, the firm must buy clean and reliable energy at the lowest cost, replacing the old equipment with the new one, and ensuring that the equipment is operated in an efficient manner. Energy accounting is also one of the limbs of best practices in enhancing efficient energy use. The firm seeking to achieve efficient energy use must create an accounting system in which it can use to locate savings, opportunities and to track and measure the success of the energy efficient practices. In the management plan, energy accounting is a very important component. It allows the firm to keep records of its past and current state on energy use. The information enables the energy manager to communicate in a measurable way about the development of the energy management within the firm. The main purpose of energy accounting is that it provides a foundation for strong energy administration plan; records and tracks the progress of energy saving strategies and provides a platform for setting realistic energy savings. Energy accounting allows the firm to record possible areas that need improvement in the future. The person in charge of the control of the industrial plant energy sector must ensure that he or she undertakes certain general practices that will promote energy efficiency promotion. Therefore, he or she must ensure that regular audits are taken from the condition of the plant and regular reports are made accordingly. Principles of Implementation\nEffective implementation of the energy efficiency programs requires certain candid consideration to the implementation guiding principles. These principles provide a process-like-approach that industries willing to manage the use of energy should adopt in order to achieve greater efficiency. The first step is to integrate key processes to promote the implementation of identified saving opportunities. In participating in the assessment processes, the personnel must be ready for the project implementation. The second step is to assign the completion of a specific project to specific individuals. The assigning of roles must take place after an internal approval has been conducted for each participating individual. Internal approval gives an assurance that the persons selected shall commit themselves fully to the demand of the project. The implementation requires that participating people are assigned specific duty and accorded specific role. Understanding the project expectation is important for the participant since it allows for the participation to the highest level. To achieve the required level of involvement, the participants must be given handouts to act as reference documents. Energy managers, plant managers, and other staff included in the process must be conscious of each person’s role and the way they fit into the overall demands of the project. The third principle demands that the implications and performance of the project assessment are communicated clearly and comprehensively to the people involved. Business case for implementation must be set from the onset of the planning process.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:929c0c21-0e8b-4180-9c6b-789a78cf4059>"]},{"passage":"Most building owners and facility managers recognize the need to track and manage energy use. Irrespective of the source (electricity, gas or oil), the efficient and effective use of energy has a direct impact on the economic bottom line. While corporations with multiple properties may employ an energy manager to oversee these efforts (often as part of a larger sustainability plan), smaller companies may rely on O&M groups, or engage third-party consultants, for energy audits of their building systems. While these approaches may be productive, many public and private clients recognize a need for a more comprehensive energy master plan, establishing short- and long-term goals in their approaches to energy. An energy roadmap takes a more comprehensive approach for the client, examining a number of issues associated with the client’s energy demand, procurement, use and security. Discussions are held with current utility providers regarding their generating capacity, growth in demand, projected fuel costs and legislative forecasts that may have an affect on their industry. In addition, system reliability and security are discussed, allowing the client to evaluate a need for redundant or stand-by capacity. Internally, clients evaluate their procedures for benchmarking and tracking energy use in their facilities, comparing against local and national indices. They can establish targets for reduction in consumption and demand, and monitoring mechanisms that may employ trend logs and sub-metering. Results from these initial efforts will identify target facilities and\/or systems for further auditing and\/or retro-commissioning. An energy roadmap can establish the methodology for prioritizing and implementing an energy conservation program, incorporating a variety of measures to improve (and maintain) system performance, as well as establish policies to be followed by O&M personnel, occupants and tenants. These methodologies and priorities can vary between clients, necessitating the tailoring of energy roadmaps according to each client’s particular situation and goals. Finally, it is important to integrate a client’s energy roadmap with any other plans, initiatives or budget constraints. For example, if the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is a major goal or the incorporation of on-site renewables (solar photovoltaic system, cogeneration, etc.) is important, then the energy roadmap must address and accommodate these requirements.

A successful program is incorporated into the mission of the organization and training of its employees. Restaurants are notorious for abusing equipment and maintaining equipment only when something goes wrong. A regular, documented cleaning and maintenance schedule will help keep equipment running longer and more efficiently. A refrigerator with dirty coils uses up to 23% more energy, 11% more with a bad door seal and up to a 100% with a refrigerant leak. To fix problems like these create a schedule of weekly, monthly and annual dates to calibrate, clean and inspect all the equipment in the house. The Tools page contains a sample maintenance schedule and repair log. Timely upgrades are also a piece of an energy efficiency program. Old equipment may be so inefficient that upgrading to energy efficient equipment may be a more cost effective solution rather than repairing, even in the short run. It is a good idea to investigate energy efficient alternatives for all the facility�s equipment so if a piece of equipment dies you are not left scrambling to find an efficient replacement or wind up with another standard efficiency unit.

This would be the responsibility of the building’s energy modeler or commissioning agent. In the long term, this responsibility shifts to the building controls engineers and operators to review continuous improvement that is made possible with the use of M&V when included in the green building tools. 4.) Help environment and climate-friendly initiatives\nResidential and commercial buildings account for almost 39 percent of total U.S. energy consumption and 38 percent of U.S. carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Nearly all of these greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the residential and commercial sectors can be attributed to energy use in buildings. As green house gas emissions increase, they build up in the atmosphere and affect the global warming and the climate change impact can persist over a long time. This can adversely impact society, plants and animals. Hence there is an increased focus on reducing these gases and the need for environment and climate-friendly initiatives and the need for sustainable building technology. M&V process is the only standard that is used across most countries to establish energy efficient building design and hence can be used to determine the impact that energy consumption has on the environment and climate change. 5.) Policy and public expenditure\nUnited Nations Environment Programme ,as part of MCA4climate, is a new initiative providing practical assistance to governments in preparing their climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. According to the 2007 international legal climate regime Bali Action Plan, a requirement for all countries was made. This meant that all countries’ climate control plans to be “measurable, reportable and verifiable”. This would be fulfilled by Measurement, reporting and verification (MRV), a protocol of M&V. This process of measurement can help national climatic and energy strategies by establishing baselines and helping to identify policies and potentials. The M&V reports are published internationally and can be used to solicit expert advice on improvement. 6.) Reduce and manage risk\nThe goal of any energy savings project is to guarantee cost and energy savings and reduce the risk of nonperformance at an acceptable level. The risk of handling the uncertainty of the expected savings and the potential financial consequences is the responsibility of both the ESCO (Energy Service Company) and the customer. Due to the involvement of multiple parties, any project using M&V has to complete the project responsibility matrix. This includes the risk, responsibilities and performance required for the project to be a success. In addition, this matrix helps identify important project risks, potential implications, mitigation plans and parties responsible for managing it. Using M&V responsibility matrix would ensure that the selection, application, design, installation and performance of the equipment and the preventive maintenance goals are met. 7.) Demand response for consumer consumption\nDemand response programs are programs that provide consumers payment incentives if consumers reduce their consumption during peak periods. M&V plans can be utilized for optimizing the consumption to avail these benefits. It can also be used to calculate savings utilizing engineering algorithms to determine a baseline from which the savings are derived. 8.) Renewable energy efficiency\nThe energy needed to run commercial and industrial buildings in the United States produces 19 percent of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, 12 percent of nitrogen oxides, and 25 percent of sulfur dioxide, at a cost of $110 billion a year. These are mostly generated by fossil fuel. This has led to alternate energy sources like solar, wind, biomass etc. that come under the term “renewable energy”. Renewable energy sources are different from regular energy sources since their productivity is directly linked to the amount of energy consumed as they are supplied by request and cannot be produced in excess. An M&V approach should be carefully structured to consider the generating capacity of the renewable energy source as well as the redundancy processes in place. This M&V plan would help in providing greater confidence that the benefits of renewable energy investments are actually being realized. 9.) Energy Saving Certificates (ESC)\nOne of the important goals of commercial building energy efficiency is to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy costs. Energy saving certificates (ESCs) is an effective tool for meeting these goals. These certificates are used as a mechanism through which commercial buildings can comply with energy efficiency targets.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:8612c090-55ca-4b87-aaff-d2c9bf261cf8>"]},{"passage":"Restaurants are the most energy intensive commercial buildings in the United States according to the Energy Information Administration. Restaurants, per square foot, consume nearly three times the energy of the average commercial building. Long hours of operation, specialized equipment and sheer demand make up much of the substantial consumption, but overall the energy consumption by foodservice buildings is excessive and often wasteful. Along the same lines, groceries are also major energy consumers among commercial buildings. Food sales buildings are the second most energy intensive buildings with around 50% of energy use going to refrigeration alone. Not surprising, the largest portion of energy use is consumed by cooking and food preparation, followed closely by heating, ventilation and cooling as a whole (HVAC). The pie graph to the right shows the average breakdown of energy use at foodservice operations. The graphs below show energy per square foot and annual energy use in terms of cost in dollars per square foot. Utilities consume approximately 2.5 to 3.4 percent of total restaurant sales, depending on the type of operation (source: National Restaurant Association 2004 Restaurant Industry Operations Report). While this seems like a relatively low expenditure, energy efficiency is a very cost effective measure. A $1 reduction in energy costs equals $12.50 in sales at an 8% profit margin. There is no need to increase sales, table turnover or your profit margin with efficiency. Many energy conservation efforts require little to no cost, but major changes in habit. Most other efficiency measures demand new equipment or technology that promise returns on investment in as little time as overnight. Practices and Policies\nPossibly the single most important energy conservation effort is human habit. Energy efficient equipment does not save energy if it is not used correctly or properly maintained. Energy conservation must be integrated into the training and daily activities of all staff to ensure successful sustainability efforts. Comprehensive Energy Management (CEM)\nA CEM program measures every watt of energy used in a facility, then implements sustainability programs or updates equipment and facilities to reduce energy consumption. The first step of implementing CEM is to measure and record energy use so you can document progress and determine what measures have been most effective. The easiest, most affordable option is to track energy bills and enter usage into a spreadsheet to compare and graph data. There is an energy use tracking tool on the Tools page that can compare and track electric and gas usage for multiple facilities. More comprehensive software programs like Portfolio Manager from the Energy Star program track and assess energy and water use then compare that data with other buildings in the same industry. Portfolio Manager helps compare resource costs, find effective facility improvements, compare multiple facilities and track energy management progress. The software is free and available on-line. A more detailed and very useful option is an interval data collection system that connects to an electric or gas meter and track energy use at set, time-stamped intervals, usually every 30 minutes. These systems are very useful in that you can see energy use rise and fall throughout the day in various graphs and use that information to change practices, startup times or track down energy use problems. For example, your HVAC company recently serviced one large air conditioner, but did not properly reset the unit to your previous configuration. As a result, the unit cycles on all night, seven days a week and the next months bill is higher than average. Without a data tracking system, the only way to discover this is to be in the restaurant at some point in the middle of the night. With the data collection system, you can not only see the energy use increase the day after the HVAC company serviced the air conditioning unit, but also see each time the A\/C unit cycled on overnight. These systems provide on-line access to energy use and a range of tools for comparing and benchmarking the data. Interval data collection systems are available through many utilities and third-party companies for a monthly or one time fee. They are highly recommended for large facilities. With or without a tracking system, a CEM program looks at everything from equipment types and placement to thermostat settings, employee habits and ways to avoid peak load costs. For example, if your operation can make it though working hours without making additional ice it may be an effective solution to set the icemaker to run overnight to decrease load charges. One of the simplest methods for reducing energy use is creating an energy checklist that schedules start-up and shutdown times for lighting and equipment so they are turned on only when needed, turned down during slow periods and turned off when not needed. There are literally thousands of ways to reduce energy, but no one CEM solution for all organizations.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:429d4a0f-1689-4c0b-ac93-158e1f5b870b>"]}]}

Hilaly's account of the meeting showed Nixon asking President\nYahya to \"convey his feelings to the Chinese at the highest\nlevel\" that he believed that 1) \"Asia can not move forward\nif a nation as large as China remains isolated,\" and 2) the\nUnited States would not be \"party to any arrangements designed\nto isolate China.\" With this conversation, Nixon had taken\nthe first step toward opening a secret channel through Pakistan\nthat would later prove decisive. 3: Xiong Xianghui, \"The Prelude to the Opening of Sino-American\nRelations,\" Zhonggong dangshi ziliao [CCP History\nMaterials] No. 42 (June 1992), excerpts\nIn the early 1990s, Xiong Xianghui published the first historical\naccount, along with documents, of a special study group tasked\nby Chairman Mao in 1969 to review China's strategic policy. Xiong,\nformerly an aide to Zhou Enlai, had been the secretary to this\ngroup, which consisted of four marshals, senior military figures\nwho had been sent to inspect factories during the Cultural Revolution. The four marshals first focused on relations with Moscow just\nas the Sino-Soviet border clashes were breaking out; although\nthey saw the Soviets as dangerous, they doubted that Moscow intended\nto launch war against China. After Lin Biao gave a speech harshly\nattacking U.S. and Soviet imperialism, Mao asked the marshals\nto think outside the box about U.S. and Soviet policy. The four\nmarshals initially doubted that the Soviets and the Americans\nwould act against China either separately or jointly. When the\nborder fighting intensified in August 1969, marshals Chen Yi and\nYe Jianying worried about a confrontation with Moscow and proposed\nplaying the \"card of the United States.\" In a separate\nreport, Chen proposed high-level talks with the U.S. in order\nto solve basic problems in the relationship. The fourth line of\nthe third page reproduced here includes the text about playing\nthe American card. (Note 1)\n4: Front page of People's Daily, 25 December 1970, showing\nfrom left, Edgar Snow, interpreter Ji Chaozhu, Mao Zedong, and\nLin Biao, at a reviewing stand facing Tiananmen Square on 1 October\nSource: Library of Congress\nIn another attempt to signal to the U.S. government but also\na domestic audience about the need for a new relationship with\nthe United States, on 1 October 1970 (National Day), Mao had journalist\nEdgar Snow stand by him at the Gate of Heavenly Peace during the\nparade. Several months later, Snow met with Mao for five hours\nof talks on 18 December 1970 during which the Chairman said the\n[T]he foreign ministry was studying the matter of admitting\nAmericans from the left, middle, and right to visit China. Should\nrightists like Nixon, who represented the monopoly capitalists,\nbe permitted to come? He should be welcomed because, Mao explained\nat present the problems between China and the US would have\nto be solved with Nixon. Mao would be happy to talk with him,\neither as a tourist or as President. A week later, perhaps to reaffirm that something was afoot with\nSino-American relations, People's Daily published a picture\nof Mao and Snow from the National Day event. While the China expert\nAllen Whiting proposed going to Switzerland to debrief Snow about\nhis trip to China and meetings with the leadership, John Holdridge,\nthe China expert on Kissinger's staff, advised against that on\nthe grounds that Snow was a leftist. Had the debriefing gone ahead,\nNixon could have learned that Mao had invited him to China, months\nbefore Snow made it public in Life magazine at the end\nof April 1971.

On April 14, 1971, only days after the visit of the U.S. ping\npong team to China, Nixon announced measures to liberalize trade\nand travel restrictions affecting China.\n\n\"26 Kwang concluded: \"The convergence of these circumstances made the interview method and the oral information gathered by it an indispensable tool in the hands of both scholars and political activists, whether they studied Chinese society for social-scientific or ideological purposes or both. When involving fieldwork and the interview technique, their approach was generally referred to as k'ao-ch'a (考察, Kao Cha, \"inspection\") or tiao-ch'a (调查, Diao Cha, \"survey; investigation\"). \"27 Indeed, Mao Zedong figured prominently in such endeavours, both as an \"oral historian\" who conducted group interviews and wrote about this practice as a method, and as a narrator, starring in American journalist Edgar Snow's interview-based account of the early Chinese Communist movement, Red Star over China.28\nOral history continued to be practiced after Mao's triumph in 1949. Kwong, like all other historians cited so far, agrees that this practice was only interrupted during the Cultural Revolution of 1966–1976. According to Kwong, from the 1950s onward, Chinese historians and other researchers carried out numerous projects on a variety of topics, often involving dozens of researchers and hundreds of interviewees.29 While historiography became realigned according to Marxist-Maoist principles, historical research became popularized: \"Factory workers and commune members delved into the past of their work units. History teachers and school students were mobilized to build up their collections of 'local history teaching materials' [乡土教材, Xiang Tu Jiao Cai, hsiang-t'u chiao-ts'ai)] by going directly to local residents to take notes on [End Page 7] what they had to say about the history of the community. \"30 Universities \"sponsored projects of historical tiao-ch'a on an unprecedented scale. \"31\nAccording to the Chinese historian Zuo Yuhe, another stream of oral history interviewing included interviews \"on revolutionary history related to the Chinese Communist Party. As early as 1935, when the Red Army completed its Long March, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party instructed the Long March participants to tell their stories orally and encouraged them to write their memoirs. After 1949, history departments at various levels of the Party made great efforts to solicit documents and oral data on Party history. \"32 It is unclear where such documents were archived and whether they are accessible. Paul Thompson writes in his latest survey of oral history in China: \"This locally produced material could provide interesting sources, but it is not clear what happened to it. \"33\nYang Liwen described another project, probably the biggest one, in 1999.34 The article reads like an official report of the Communist Party of China and describes work of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), \"a patriotic united front which has brought together numerous democratic factions and people from all walks of life to participate in the political process. \"35 Part of this political process premier Zhou Enlai initiated in 1959 was to popularize historical investigations into the everyday life of Chinese people. This appeared to have been a massive undertaking: \"As of the mid-1990s,\" Yang claimed, \"their collective efforts had resulted in the publication of over 11,600 volumes of the Literature and History Materials Series, representing 4,400 different topics and approximately 1.6 billion characters of writing.… As many as 300,000 people contributed eyewitness accounts to the project which was administered by a staff totaling 3,000 people. \"36 The Literature and History Materials Series seemed to have been archived rather than published, but by 1993, twenty-four edited volumes had been published in the Library of Literature and History Materials in China.37 Thompson writes that Yang Liwen led this project for many years.

Three dynasties preceded the unification of China in 221 BCE: Xia (2070 BCE), Shang (1600 BCE), Zhou (1046 BCE). The Zhou period is a time of flourishing civilization. The writing was codified and ironwork became more sophisticated. China saw the rise of philosophers such as Confucius and Lao-Zi (Taoism) in this period. During the mid-Zhou dynasty, power was decentralized and China entered what is known as the “Spring and Autumn Waring Period” (722-221 BCE). Sun-Zi and The Art of War emerged during this time. China was fractured into seven kingdoms. In 221 BCE, the Kingdom of Qin subdued the other six and proclaimed its king, Ying Zheng, the First Emperor of China – “Qin ShiHuang.”\nDuring Qin ShiHuang’s reign, writing and measurements were unified under a single system; government rule was centralized; trade was made easier by uniformed currency and standardized width of cart-wheels. Qin-ShiHuang was also famous for building the first section of The Great Wall of China and his “Terracotta Army” which accompanied him to his tomb. Many dynasties followed Qin. Most notably the Tang Dynasty, which was known as China’s golden age (618-907 AD); the Song Dynasty, which saw great scientific and technological advancements (960-1279 AD); and Ming Dynasty, which saw the completion of the Great Wall and the Forbidden City (1368-1644 AD). The last dynasty of China, (Qing) was ruled by the Manchus and ended in 1911. The Qing dynasty was succeeded by China’s modern republic age and eventually saw the rise of the People’s Republic of China in 1949. During the Qing dynasty (in 1868), the United States and China entered into the Burlingame Treaty. This treaty established a formal relationship between the two countries. China was granted “most favored nation” status and immigration were encouraged. The first wave of Chinese immigrants arrived in the United States between the 1850s to 1880s. They mostly settled along the coasts (in California or New York). Most Chinese immigrants were labors working to build railroads. In the 1870s, there were repeated efforts to limit Chinese immigration to the United States. The Fifteen Passenger Bill of 1879 limited the number of Chinese passengers to 15 in any single voyage to the United States. President Rutherford B. Hayes vetoed the bill because it violated the terms of the Burlingame Treaty. Following the veto, President Hayes sent James Burrill Angell to China and he successfully negotiated a new treaty allowing restrictions on Chinese immigration. Following the Angell Treaty of 1880 was the passage of the infamous Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. This Act was not repealed until 1943 under the Magnuson Act. Following the repeal, the second wave of Chinese immigrants to the US began from the late 1970s to the present. The first Chinese migrants in Ohio were mostly descendants of Chinese immigrants who had settled on the West Coast. A majority of them moved to northeastern Ohio (Cleveland area). Some came to Cincinnati and made this region their home. According to a local new paper report of the Census Bureau account, there were 17 Chinese living in Cincinnati in 1910 (“SEVENTEEN CHINESE: And Seven Japanese Lived in Cincinnati in 1910, Report Says.” SPECIAL DISPATCH TO THE ENQUIRER, Nov 28, 1914).\n\nHotchkiss in China (June 2017)\nPlease note that this page is about a past program. If you are interested in other educational travel opportunities in China -- independently or through Hotchkiss -- please contact Mr. Hall. This twelve-day program in June 2017 provided a first-hand look at the rise of modern China. We experienced China’s recent past through engaging walks through Beijing and Shanghai, unpacking important historical sites, wandering down ancient alleyways, and exploring an East German electronics factory repurposed as an artist colony. These sites challenged us to unpack what we mean by “modern China” and think about how China balances the quest to be a fully modern nation with the desire to remain fully Chinese. We charted an evolutionary trajectory through Chinese urban spaces, considering what the pasts of Beijing and Shanghai might suggest about the future development of these – and other – rising global cities. Our urban experience was contrasted with an overnight stay at the Great Wall, where we caught a glimpse of a rural life while gaining another perspective on how urbanization has dramatically transformed the country. Along the way, we were guided on our journey by Jeremiah Jenne, a Beijing-based scholar of modern Chinese history and interacted with journalists, academics, and cultural figures who helped connect the past to the present social, political, and environmental challenges. Questions for investigation\n- What we mean by “modern China” and how does China balances the quest to be a fully modern nation with the desire to remain fully Chinese? - What do the pasts of Beijing and Shanghai suggest about the future development of these – and other – rising global cities? - How does China’s culture and society compare to your own? Who is this program for? This program is an especially strong fit for Hotchkiss students with background or interest in Chinese or East Asian history, economic development, and Chinese language and culture.\n\nThus, as elsewhere, studies exploring the connections between earlier oral history practices and current developments will only strengthen current practices by helping oral historians reflect more deeply on their assumptions, methods, and theories. And by placing their oral history practices into a broader context of interviewing and storytelling, they will better understand their narrators' and their own capacities for talking about their lives. This brief survey may help us understand the history of oral history in China; but perhaps more importantly for oral historians outside of China, it confronts us with new questions about the history of our own practices and theories.

I am particularly indebted to a Chinese colleague who wishes to remain anonymous but who provided critical and valuable feedback on this article.

Much of what Kwong described as different in China could equally be said for oral history elsewhere.

While the archiving of oral history is often seen as an ideal, the reality is often different.

Among the topics discussed are: migration patterns, source and target regions of migration, laws (U.S. federal and state, and Chinese) that target or significantly affect migration patterns, court cases and administrative\/bureaucratic developments affecting migration. |Year||Month and date (if available)||Event type||Affected region||Details|\n|1644||Regime change||China||The Qing dynasty takes over control of China from the Ming dynasty, and maintains the capital at Beijing. Resistance to the Qing, initially led by the deposed Ming, builds in South China, mainly the province of Guangdong. After the Ming resistance is killed off, dissatisfaction with the Qing dynasty continues, and interest in alternative systems is developed through the exchange of goods and ideas carried out via the ports in the South China Sea, such as the Port of Guangdong. In the 19th century, the residents of Guangdong and nearby southern provinces, such as Fujian, develop interest in the United States, due to a mix of its wealth, novel system of government, and success at overthrowing its imperial overlords the British.|\n|1815||Beginning of migration||California||Migration from China to the United States begins at a very small scale, along with the opening of trade between China and the United States. See the Wikipedia page History of Chinese Americans for more context.|\n|1834||Beginning of migration||New York City||Afong Moy is the first Chinese woman to arrive in the United States. She is brought from her home town of Guangzhou to New York City by Nathaniel and Frederick Carne, who exhibit her as \"the Chinese Lady\".|\n|1839–1842||War||China||The First Opium War occurs, culminating in the highly unequal Treaty of Nanking. The war disproportionately impacts South China, including the provinces that would see significant emigration to the United States in later years, though its causal role is unclear. The war also leads to negative views of the British in South China, although the negative views do not extend to the American, for whom some affinity remains given their success at achieving independence from the British.|\n|1842–1900||Missionary activity||China||Protestant missions in China become more active following the opening of ports as a result of the Treaty of Nanking. These help spread Christianity in China and make some Chinese more familiar with the English language.|\n|1844||July 3||Treaty||United States||The Treaty of Wanghia is signed at the Kun Iam Temple between the United States of America (represented by Caleb Cushing, a lawyer dispatched by President John Tyler) and Keying, the Viceroy of Liangguang, representing the Qing Empire that rules China. It would be ratified by United States President John Tyler on January 17, 1845. The treaty is an unequal treaty, and its 34 articles deal with assuring the rights of US ships, traders, and citizens in China. Reciprocal rights of Chinese traders and citizens in the United States are not covered. Subsequent treaties would be more equal.|\n|1848||January||Beginning of migration||California||Gold is discovered in California, leading to a California Gold Rush. A number of people from China arrive in the United States to participate in the Gold Rush. Before 1848, the total number of Chinese in the United States is only 325; soon, annual immigration from China exceeds this amount.|\n|1848||February||Jurisdictional definitions and boundaries||California||The Mexican–American War concludes, and Alta California (which includes the modern U.S. state of California, plus nearby regions) is established to be part of the United States.|\n|1849||Organization||California (San Francisco)||The Chew Yick Association, one of the earliest organizations of Chinese in the United States, elects Norman As-sing, a prominent Chinese merchant, as their leader.\n\n### Question: When did the first group of scholars from CCAS visit China, and who was involved?","passages":[{"passage":"Understanding China And Ourselves\nMark Seldon blogs in a series titled “My First Trip to China”.

Hilaly's account of the meeting showed Nixon asking President\nYahya to \"convey his feelings to the Chinese at the highest\nlevel\" that he believed that 1) \"Asia can not move forward\nif a nation as large as China remains isolated,\" and 2) the\nUnited States would not be \"party to any arrangements designed\nto isolate China.\" With this conversation, Nixon had taken\nthe first step toward opening a secret channel through Pakistan\nthat would later prove decisive. 3: Xiong Xianghui, \"The Prelude to the Opening of Sino-American\nRelations,\" Zhonggong dangshi ziliao [CCP History\nMaterials] No. 42 (June 1992), excerpts\nIn the early 1990s, Xiong Xianghui published the first historical\naccount, along with documents, of a special study group tasked\nby Chairman Mao in 1969 to review China's strategic policy. Xiong,\nformerly an aide to Zhou Enlai, had been the secretary to this\ngroup, which consisted of four marshals, senior military figures\nwho had been sent to inspect factories during the Cultural Revolution. The four marshals first focused on relations with Moscow just\nas the Sino-Soviet border clashes were breaking out; although\nthey saw the Soviets as dangerous, they doubted that Moscow intended\nto launch war against China. After Lin Biao gave a speech harshly\nattacking U.S. and Soviet imperialism, Mao asked the marshals\nto think outside the box about U.S. and Soviet policy. The four\nmarshals initially doubted that the Soviets and the Americans\nwould act against China either separately or jointly. When the\nborder fighting intensified in August 1969, marshals Chen Yi and\nYe Jianying worried about a confrontation with Moscow and proposed\nplaying the \"card of the United States.\" In a separate\nreport, Chen proposed high-level talks with the U.S. in order\nto solve basic problems in the relationship. The fourth line of\nthe third page reproduced here includes the text about playing\nthe American card.

Should\nrightists like Nixon, who represented the monopoly capitalists,\nbe permitted to come? He should be welcomed because, Mao explained\nat present the problems between China and the US would have\nto be solved with Nixon. Mao would be happy to talk with him,\neither as a tourist or as President. A week later, perhaps to reaffirm that something was afoot with\nSino-American relations, People's Daily published a picture\nof Mao and Snow from the National Day event. While the China expert\nAllen Whiting proposed going to Switzerland to debrief Snow about\nhis trip to China and meetings with the leadership, John Holdridge,\nthe China expert on Kissinger's staff, advised against that on\nthe grounds that Snow was a leftist.

When involving fieldwork and the interview technique, their approach was generally referred to as k'ao-ch'a (考察, Kao Cha, \"inspection\") or tiao-ch'a (调查, Diao Cha, \"survey; investigation\"). \"27 Indeed, Mao Zedong figured prominently in such endeavours, both as an \"oral historian\" who conducted group interviews and wrote about this practice as a method, and as a narrator, starring in American journalist Edgar Snow's interview-based account of the early Chinese Communist movement, Red Star over China.28\nOral history continued to be practiced after Mao's triumph in 1949. Kwong, like all other historians cited so far, agrees that this practice was only interrupted during the Cultural Revolution of 1966–1976. According to Kwong, from the 1950s onward, Chinese historians and other researchers carried out numerous projects on a variety of topics, often involving dozens of researchers and hundreds of interviewees.29 While historiography became realigned according to Marxist-Maoist principles, historical research became popularized: \"Factory workers and commune members delved into the past of their work units. History teachers and school students were mobilized to build up their collections of 'local history teaching materials' [乡土教材, Xiang Tu Jiao Cai, hsiang-t'u chiao-ts'ai)] by going directly to local residents to take notes on [End Page 7] what they had to say about the history of the community. \"30 Universities \"sponsored projects of historical tiao-ch'a on an unprecedented scale. \"31\nAccording to the Chinese historian Zuo Yuhe, another stream of oral history interviewing included interviews \"on revolutionary history related to the Chinese Communist Party. As early as 1935, when the Red Army completed its Long March, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party instructed the Long March participants to tell their stories orally and encouraged them to write their memoirs. After 1949, history departments at various levels of the Party made great efforts to solicit documents and oral data on Party history. \"32 It is unclear where such documents were archived and whether they are accessible. Paul Thompson writes in his latest survey of oral history in China: \"This locally produced material could provide interesting sources, but it is not clear what happened to it. \"33\nYang Liwen described another project, probably the biggest one, in 1999.34 The article reads like an official report of the Communist Party of China and describes work of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), \"a patriotic united front which has brought together numerous democratic factions and people from all walks of life to participate in the political process. \"35 Part of this political process premier Zhou Enlai initiated in 1959 was to popularize historical investigations into the everyday life of Chinese people. This appeared to have been a massive undertaking: \"As of the mid-1990s,\" Yang claimed, \"their collective efforts had resulted in the publication of over 11,600 volumes of the Literature and History Materials Series, representing 4,400 different topics and approximately 1.6 billion characters of writing.… As many as 300,000 people contributed eyewitness accounts to the project which was administered by a staff totaling 3,000 people. \"36 The Literature and History Materials Series seemed to have been archived rather than published, but by 1993, twenty-four edited volumes had been published in the Library of Literature and History Materials in China.37 Thompson writes that Yang Liwen led this project for many years. The project expanded in the 1980s from a focus [End Page 8] \"on the pre-Revolution decades, the People's Liberation Army, and the Party itself … to include the economy, sciences, culture, ethnic minorities, and women.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:c28d822b-6af6-436b-b574-bec42930dd7d>"]},{"passage":"Ancient Civilizations: China\nStudents read about the daily life, history, dynasties, and ancient celebration of ancient China. 15 Views 93 Downloads\nCommunicating Through Art: Drawing Conclusions About Culture Through Artifact Study in Ancient China\nSeventh graders identify key aspects of Chinese culture displayed through art.

The writing was codified and ironwork became more sophisticated. China saw the rise of philosophers such as Confucius and Lao-Zi (Taoism) in this period. During the mid-Zhou dynasty, power was decentralized and China entered what is known as the “Spring and Autumn Waring Period” (722-221 BCE). Sun-Zi and The Art of War emerged during this time. China was fractured into seven kingdoms. In 221 BCE, the Kingdom of Qin subdued the other six and proclaimed its king, Ying Zheng, the First Emperor of China – “Qin ShiHuang.”\nDuring Qin ShiHuang’s reign, writing and measurements were unified under a single system; government rule was centralized; trade was made easier by uniformed currency and standardized width of cart-wheels. Qin-ShiHuang was also famous for building the first section of The Great Wall of China and his “Terracotta Army” which accompanied him to his tomb. Many dynasties followed Qin. Most notably the Tang Dynasty, which was known as China’s golden age (618-907 AD); the Song Dynasty, which saw great scientific and technological advancements (960-1279 AD); and Ming Dynasty, which saw the completion of the Great Wall and the Forbidden City (1368-1644 AD). The last dynasty of China, (Qing) was ruled by the Manchus and ended in 1911. The Qing dynasty was succeeded by China’s modern republic age and eventually saw the rise of the People’s Republic of China in 1949. During the Qing dynasty (in 1868), the United States and China entered into the Burlingame Treaty. This treaty established a formal relationship between the two countries. China was granted “most favored nation” status and immigration were encouraged. The first wave of Chinese immigrants arrived in the United States between the 1850s to 1880s. They mostly settled along the coasts (in California or New York). Most Chinese immigrants were labors working to build railroads. In the 1870s, there were repeated efforts to limit Chinese immigration to the United States. The Fifteen Passenger Bill of 1879 limited the number of Chinese passengers to 15 in any single voyage to the United States. President Rutherford B. Hayes vetoed the bill because it violated the terms of the Burlingame Treaty. Following the veto, President Hayes sent James Burrill Angell to China and he successfully negotiated a new treaty allowing restrictions on Chinese immigration. Following the Angell Treaty of 1880 was the passage of the infamous Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. This Act was not repealed until 1943 under the Magnuson Act. Following the repeal, the second wave of Chinese immigrants to the US began from the late 1970s to the present. The first Chinese migrants in Ohio were mostly descendants of Chinese immigrants who had settled on the West Coast. A majority of them moved to northeastern Ohio (Cleveland area). Some came to Cincinnati and made this region their home. According to a local new paper report of the Census Bureau account, there were 17 Chinese living in Cincinnati in 1910 (“SEVENTEEN CHINESE: And Seven Japanese Lived in Cincinnati in 1910, Report Says.” SPECIAL DISPATCH TO THE ENQUIRER, Nov 28, 1914).","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:8c61a8af-f3c2-463a-bc32-9cd9933cc8c7>"]},{"passage":"Hotchkiss in China (June 2017)\nPlease note that this page is about a past program. If you are interested in other educational travel opportunities in China -- independently or through Hotchkiss -- please contact Mr. Hall. This twelve-day program in June 2017 provided a first-hand look at the rise of modern China. We experienced China’s recent past through engaging walks through Beijing and Shanghai, unpacking important historical sites, wandering down ancient alleyways, and exploring an East German electronics factory repurposed as an artist colony. These sites challenged us to unpack what we mean by “modern China” and think about how China balances the quest to be a fully modern nation with the desire to remain fully Chinese. We charted an evolutionary trajectory through Chinese urban spaces, considering what the pasts of Beijing and Shanghai might suggest about the future development of these – and other – rising global cities. Our urban experience was contrasted with an overnight stay at the Great Wall, where we caught a glimpse of a rural life while gaining another perspective on how urbanization has dramatically transformed the country. Along the way, we were guided on our journey by Jeremiah Jenne, a Beijing-based scholar of modern Chinese history and interacted with journalists, academics, and cultural figures who helped connect the past to the present social, political, and environmental challenges. Questions for investigation\n- What we mean by “modern China” and how does China balances the quest to be a fully modern nation with the desire to remain fully Chinese? - What do the pasts of Beijing and Shanghai suggest about the future development of these – and other – rising global cities? - How does China’s culture and society compare to your own? Who is this program for? This program is an especially strong fit for Hotchkiss students with background or interest in Chinese or East Asian history, economic development, and Chinese language and culture.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:4fc7e08a-8227-4953-b456-458045b02a5d>"]},{"passage":"Thus, as elsewhere, studies exploring the connections between earlier oral history practices and current developments will only strengthen current practices by helping oral historians reflect more deeply on their assumptions, methods, and theories. And by placing their oral history practices into a broader context of interviewing and storytelling, they will better understand their narrators' and their own capacities for talking about their lives. This brief survey may help us understand the history of oral history in China; but perhaps more importantly for oral historians outside of China, it confronts us with new questions about the history of our own practices and theories.

Among the topics discussed are: migration patterns, source and target regions of migration, laws (U.S. federal and state, and Chinese) that target or significantly affect migration patterns, court cases and administrative\/bureaucratic developments affecting migration. |Year||Month and date (if available)||Event type||Affected region||Details|\n|1644||Regime change||China||The Qing dynasty takes over control of China from the Ming dynasty, and maintains the capital at Beijing. Resistance to the Qing, initially led by the deposed Ming, builds in South China, mainly the province of Guangdong. After the Ming resistance is killed off, dissatisfaction with the Qing dynasty continues, and interest in alternative systems is developed through the exchange of goods and ideas carried out via the ports in the South China Sea, such as the Port of Guangdong. In the 19th century, the residents of Guangdong and nearby southern provinces, such as Fujian, develop interest in the United States, due to a mix of its wealth, novel system of government, and success at overthrowing its imperial overlords the British.|\n|1815||Beginning of migration||California||Migration from China to the United States begins at a very small scale, along with the opening of trade between China and the United States. See the Wikipedia page History of Chinese Americans for more context.|\n|1834||Beginning of migration||New York City||Afong Moy is the first Chinese woman to arrive in the United States. She is brought from her home town of Guangzhou to New York City by Nathaniel and Frederick Carne, who exhibit her as \"the Chinese Lady\".|\n|1839–1842||War||China||The First Opium War occurs, culminating in the highly unequal Treaty of Nanking. The war disproportionately impacts South China, including the provinces that would see significant emigration to the United States in later years, though its causal role is unclear. The war also leads to negative views of the British in South China, although the negative views do not extend to the American, for whom some affinity remains given their success at achieving independence from the British.|\n|1842–1900||Missionary activity||China||Protestant missions in China become more active following the opening of ports as a result of the Treaty of Nanking. These help spread Christianity in China and make some Chinese more familiar with the English language.|\n|1844||July 3||Treaty||United States||The Treaty of Wanghia is signed at the Kun Iam Temple between the United States of America (represented by Caleb Cushing, a lawyer dispatched by President John Tyler) and Keying, the Viceroy of Liangguang, representing the Qing Empire that rules China. It would be ratified by United States President John Tyler on January 17, 1845. The treaty is an unequal treaty, and its 34 articles deal with assuring the rights of US ships, traders, and citizens in China. Reciprocal rights of Chinese traders and citizens in the United States are not covered. Subsequent treaties would be more equal.|\n|1848||January||Beginning of migration||California||Gold is discovered in California, leading to a California Gold Rush. A number of people from China arrive in the United States to participate in the Gold Rush. Before 1848, the total number of Chinese in the United States is only 325; soon, annual immigration from China exceeds this amount.|\n|1848||February||Jurisdictional definitions and boundaries||California||The Mexican–American War concludes, and Alta California (which includes the modern U.S. state of California, plus nearby regions) is established to be part of the United States.|\n|1849||Organization||California (San Francisco)||The Chew Yick Association, one of the earliest organizations of Chinese in the United States, elects Norman As-sing, a prominent Chinese merchant, as their leader.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:04ae36bd-ac01-4cec-ba0f-76eba8e205e4>"]}]}

Finding Analytical Field Amplitude Derivatives by Using RCWA Книга по Требованию Nico v.d.A. |\nThese so-called forward models solve Maxwell' s equations for time-harmonic fields by transforming them into algebraic eigensystems. The reconstruction of a grating shape starts with an initial guess of its shape. The diffracted field is computed with the forward model and compared to actual measurements. The difference between them determines how the shape parameters should be adjusted. This will be repeated iteratively until an optimal solution has been found. The focus of this work lies in finding the first- order derivatives of the diffracted field with respect to the physical parameters. This can be done by finite differences, but straightforward differentiation of the relations within RCWA gives a more accurate and faster way to find these derivatives. Periodic structures, called diffraction gratings, play an important role in optical lithography. When the incident field and the shape of a grating is known, the diffracted field can be computed by using the rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) or the C method. |The importance of golf and its effect on the tourism industry.

In order to further illustrate the key points from Chapter 4, this chapter contains a number of worked examples of questions about the effects of interventions. As we mentioned in the preface of the book, we believe that it can be easier to learn the process of critical appraisal when you see some worked examples of how it is done, and it is even better when the examples are from your own health profession. Therefore, this chapter (and Chapters 7, 9 and 11) contains examples from a range of health professions. Some of the clinical examples are relevant to more than one health profession.

It isn’t that there isn’t a problem. The virus and associated disease are real. But a good detective doesn’t try to nail a drug mule while ignoring the existence of the agent who loaded the mule. And a super detective might probe deeper and see how to dry up demand for the drug! Please translate my analogy terms to fit the case at hand! Consider a sample opinion from an agricultural researcher who was knighted for his work. Sir Albert Howard did his work at a time when agriculture was undergoing a radical transformation that discarded time proven traditional approaches in favour of economic driven technologies. World War I had produced a huge explosives industry and nitrogen producers were looking for peace time uses for their product. He would have agreed that a ‘one, two, three, blastoff’ approach was being applied and that multiple micro clues were being ignored. He wasn’t an advocate of faulted or inefficient agricultural from certain periods in the past, which he felt accounted for many past human difficulties but he did feel that many basic biology facts were being overlooked – both in past and in the new dollar driven approach that was taking hold. He was convinced through theory and research that soil must ‘live’ and that the associated mycorrhizal mechanism must be an essential link in plant nutrition and that this fact was being ignored in the new use of artificial fertilizers and associated support chemicals. His prediction of the outcome was written in 1940 – that’s a long time back – not a date very many living today experienced. Will his futuristic prediction prove accurate, eventually? Is it accurate already? (additional information on Albert Howard via links on the home page of this website)\n“because artificial plants, artificial animals, and artificial men are unhealthy and can only be protected from the parasites, whose duty it is to remove them, by means of poison sprays, vaccines and serums and an expensive system of patent medicines, panel doctors, hospitals and so forth. When the finance of crop production is considered together with that of the various social services which are needed to repair the consequences of an unsound agriculture, and when it is borne in mind that our greatest possession is a healthy, virile population, the cheapness of artificial manures disappears altogether. In the years to come, chemical manures will be considered as one of the greatest follies of the industrial epoch. The teachings of the agricultural economists of this period will be dismissed as superficial.”\nHoward was of the strong opinion that as men walk down the road of life, that time and chance may necessitate detours or occasional difficult going. He appreciated that one may stub a toe now and then, but for the vast majority of the time, human bodies are designed to work with amazing reliability - and for a life time, men should be able to focus on ‘Living’ and not be marginalized with constant repairs and major breakdowns and fears of such. If there are problems, is it that we are Monday morning lemons or just ignorant of simple and essential maintenance principles? Human life is finite but why not ‘Live’ while you are alive and then die quickly! Sputtering along at half throttle is not ‘Living’! We should be able to do better than giving the rotting dead the will to live. There is talk of covid 19 vaccine developers getting a Nobel prize. Is dealing with a single disease out of thousands note worthy? Sort of. But Howard proposed an immunity approach that kicked at all diseases – communicable as well as bigger and ongoing modern killers like heart disease, cancer, and diabedes. Should he get a posthumous Nobel prize? Life Style brilliance is really THE broad spectrum Super Vaccine! And it takes an army of Maestro Sherlocks to assemble the clues to develop that winner. Where are they in the herd of 'three count launch' detectives? And when one surfaces, is he beaten down as a heretic? Howard focused on agriculture method and its impact on plant, animal, and human health. The worrisome aspect is that this is only one underlying facet of the stability of current society. Is it possible that basic errors that Howard detected in agriculture also show up in most other underlying society support structures? Medicine, Economics, Education, Religion, City Planning, Public Health, General Business, Historic accuracy – feel free to add to the list.\n\nThe Caribbean benefited from the concern of the colonial authorities who appointed a series of commissions to investigate these diseases. The Rockefeller and Moyne Commissions and the Irvine Committee are notable investigative mechanisms established during the early to mid-1900s. Their research made recommendations that revolutionized health care services in the Caribbean. Table 1 depicts deaths and infant mortality rates (per 1 000) for select Caribbean territories during the early 1900s. During this period, health care expenditure in the Caribbean ranged from a low of 8.9% of total expenditure in British Honduras and Montserrat to a high of 18.6% in Saint Kitts and Nevis and 19.6% in Saint Vincent. Other countries, such as Barbados, Jamaica, and Trinidad, spent 11.3%, 9.8%, and 9.2% of their budgets, respectively, on health care (6). The first half of the twentieth century brought two important health care milestones to the Caribbean: the establishment of the West Indies School of Public Health to train public health nurses and inspectors, and the establishment of the University College of the West Indies to train doctors. A PHC system gradually developed with the concept of the \"health team approach,\" the creation of medical districts, and the development of health centers to provide first-line health care (2). ALMA-ATA AND THE CARIBBEAN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE STRATEGY\nThe Declaration of Alma-Ata, made in 1978, encapsulates the principal processes and strategies for PHC and served as the linchpin for the call to \"Health for All by the Year 2000\" (1, 7). The Declaration highlighted the value of intersectoral linkages and political commitment and responsibility to attain this goal. Of key importance was the concept that socioeconomic development is critical to health care delivery and reform. In response to this call for action, Caribbean ministers of health, through the assistance of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the United Nations Children's Fund, the United States Agency for International Development, and the University of the West Indies (UWI), among others, convened a workshop in 1981 to develop a Caribbean strategy for PHC (8). Seven years later, PAHO conducted an evaluation of the PHC progress made in four countries, namely Anguilla, Barbados, Grenada, and Saint Lucia. Most of these countries had embarked on developing an intersectoral approach to the implementation of PHC through convening national intersectoral workshops, and the establishment of a PHC Intersectoral Committee in at least one country (8). In Jamaica, where a policy decision had been made in 1977 to expand PHC services, the pace was far advanced. The country's approach was documented in \"Primary Health Care: the Jamaican Perspective,\" and it was through this document that key contributions were made to the discussions at Alma-Ata (9). One of the outstanding goals laid out in this document was that there should be a PHC center within 10 miles (16 km) of every citizen. Acknowledging the shortage and poor utilization of human resources within the health sector, the Jamaican response was to train a cadre of community health aides as an \"interface between the community and the health delivery system for health promotion, health education, disease prevention, and follow-up of persons to ensure that they kept clinic appointments. . .\" (10). This training experiment was the innovative and visionary work of Sir Kenneth Standard and Olive Ennever of the UWI Department of Social and Preventative Medicine (now the Department of Community Health and Psychiatry). Success led to its adoption by several countries, such as Antigua, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent, as early as 1967before the Alma-Ata Conference. Other additions to the health care team included the school dental nurse and dental assistant in 1970; the nurse practitioner, 1978; and the pharmacy technician, 1980 (10). Increased collaboration within the Caribbean community, especially in the area of environmental health, was denoted by the development of the Caribbean Environmental Health Strategy and the establishment of the Pan Caribbean Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Program in the 1980s. The training and placement of national epidemiologists, the move towards the development of surveillance systems and computerized information systems (although at an uneven pace across the Caribbean), and the development of the advisory role of the Caribbean Epidemiology Center (CAREC) were among the important mileposts since the Alma-Ata Conference (8). Programs funded through local and international resources to upgrade unsatisfactory health facilities were implemented.\n\nPublic policy and infrastructure\nCarr noted in 1985 (4) that, within a decade of the Declaration of Alma-Ata, Caribbean countries would make significant efforts to develop national health policies and programs. With the emerging epidemiological profile of diseases in the Caribbean, national health policies must illustrate public policy support for healthy living. The changing role of government, in light of health care privatization, does not relieve its role in policy development; in fact, it increases the need for standards and regulation. The successful adoption of the Caribbean Charter for Health Promotion (32) remains questionable. PHC services in the Caribbean are still oriented toward curative programs rather than preventive ones. This fact is further evidenced by the allocation of funds between the two areas. With an aging population, the need for more PHC facilities will increase significantly over time (30). This may require the development of poli- cies for \"geriatric-friendly\" services at all service institutionsprimary and secondary health care, as well as other economic and social institutions. Examples of such services may include facilities that provide live-in care and recreational activities for the elderly (nursing homes, elderly day care centers, etc. ), and wheelchair access and elder services in public and private spaces. Also important are the improvement and development of primary and secondary health care facilities and services, and the increased number of caregivers needed for the large numbers of persons who will suffer mortality and morbidity from injuries, HIV, and other maladies. Environmental issues and urbanization\nPopulation growth and increased urbanization have placed a significant strain on the network of social goods and services required to support communities (3). Unplanned development has resulted in the scattering of shantytowns across the landscape of various Caribbean countries. Lack of a safe water supply and appropriate facilities for waste and sewerage has increased the risk of disease transmission. Existing roads, housing, sewerage, and other infrastructure have often proven inadequate to meet the needs of a growing urban population. In addition, shrinking economies will be challenged to provide adequate employment opportunities. Unemployment is likely to have the spin-off effect of escalating illegal and criminal activity. Some additional burdens on the health care system are mortality and morbidity from violence, diminished resources to support national health infrastructure, demoralized staff, and other issues that negatively affect service delivery at primary and secondary health care levels. Not to be overlooked is the impact of urbanization on road fatalities and injuries, and the subsequent burden on the health care system. Sociocultural and lifestyle challenges\nAlleyne and Sealy (33) make the point that in the Caribbean there is a strong correlation between the percentage of food energy from fats, and deaths from breast or prostrate cancer. Nutrition-related diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and stroke, are common features of the Caribbean's epidemiological profile (1521). The recent introduction of fast-food chains to the Caribbean is likely to contribute to \"excessive consumption of fatty, sugary, and salty foods\" (3), and consequently, to an increased prevalence of chronic diseases. Additionally, the perception that \"fat is good\"that a robust female, often overweight or obese, is attractive to malesis among the challenges faced by health educators who are developing programs to target obesity. This also poses a challenge at the PHC level in managing disease burden in the population, and requires a more integrated approach, with the patient playing a critical role in self-monitoring. Changes in family structure, values, and attitudes (34) have resulted in the promotion and glorification of lawlessness. A violent culture is taking root in the wider Caribbean. The threat that this development poses to PHC is very real and direct. This has historically been a major issue in some countries, such as Jamaica, but it is now showing up on the public health radar of others (e.g., the Bahamas, Barbados, and Guyana), impacting adolescents and young adults in particular (21). Poor lifestyle choices, such as smoking, lack of physical activity, and drug and alcohol use, are having a critical impact on the health status of the Caribbean people. Examples from the Jamaican Healthy Lifestyle Survey (18) include a reported cigarette smoking prevalence of 28.4% in males, with 30% of respondents having smoked marijuana at least once, and relatively low levels of physical activity, among other issues. Physical activity is highly recommended, as it has been shown to be a moderating factor in cardiovascular disease risk (35).\n\nFuture implementers should embed these lessons learned in similar interventions, assess their impact and share their findings to ensure continuous learning and programme improvement.

The exercise will determine the resilience of food and water safety and health and agriculture-related sectors in response to the effects of climate change in the region. Objectives include identifying strengths, gaps, and opportunities in the surveillance and outbreak investigation of foodborne diseases and hazards related to climate and weather events; identifying reservoirs for food and waterborne pathogens; and, to assess the capacity for implementing climate integrated foodborne disease early warning systems. The work is part of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) coordinated EU and CARIFORUM Strengthening Climate Resilient Health Systems in the Caribbean project. Assessments of past national food safety plans have shown limited incorporation of climate resilience, however, CARPHA and PAHO will review and revise the plans with countries, factoring in climate adaptation and mitigation strategies. Hurricanes, floods, and droughts are putting pressure on food production systems in the Caribbean, making countries highly dependent on food imports and volatile prices. “While the body of evidence is slowly growing on an international scale, work on climate change and food safety risks have not been well documented in the Caribbean region, nor has the Caribbean’s ability to respond to climate-driven outbreak events been assessed. With a scarcity of information, the Caribbean will continue to remain vulnerable to the effects of climate change on food safety and security,” said Joy St. John, executive director at CARPHA. Out of 10 participating countries, the majority have developed national food safety plans and country officials recognize the effects of climate change on national and regional food safety, as well as the increased future risks. Emphasis will be placed on strengthening surveillance systems, including laboratory capacity to detect foodborne diseases. Ottorino Cosivi, from the Pan American Center for Foot-and-Mouth Disease and Veterinary Public Health (PANAFTOSA), said Caribbean countries are particularly at risk because of emerging diseases from climate change. “There is a delicate balance between the health of people, the health of animals, and ecosystems. If the balance is broken, public health can be affected. There is an increasing need to build climate-resilient food systems under the One Health approach to ensure food safety along the food value chain and improve productivity in a sustainable manner.”\nPAHO and PANAFTOSA are trying to strengthen national food control systems through standards and regulations; education and communication; surveillance; inspection and laboratories. It is estimated that in the Americas, every year 77 million people suffer from foodborne diseases and more than 9,000 die. FAO role in regional projects\nRenata Clarke, FAO sub-regional coordinator, said the current focus on a regional approach to food security should extend to food safety. “An ongoing FAO project is enabling countries to carry out systematic assessments of their food control systems that allow countries to recognize areas of weakness and to plan effectively to address them. There needs to be constant vigilance to ensure that our food safety system is keeping pace with changes provoked by climate change, by technology, and by changing lifestyles,” she said. “The spirit of World Food Safety Day is to bring home the message that food safety is everyone’s business. It is not just about what governments and industries can do. There is much that consumers must do as well.”\nEarlier this year, more than 30 stakeholders were trained during a workshop on Assessing Food Control Systems in the Bahamas, organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Bahamas Agricultural Health and food Safety Authority (BAHFSA). Bahamas is doing a pilot assessment using the FAO\/World Health Organization (WHO) Food Control System Assessment tool, which is based on Codex Alimentarius guidelines. The pilot also involves Guyana, with a follow-up meeting planned to share the experiences, lessons learned, benefits and challenges of the assessments with other Caribbean countries. Participants will begin the actual assessment of the food control system of the Bahamas by gathering information from relevant food and agriculture authorities. Future meetings will endorse recommendations for improvements to the control system and develop a framework to engage decision-makers to ensure commitment and political support. Clay Sweeting, Minister of Agriculture, Marine Resources and Family Island Affairs, said the assessment was necessary to improve cooperation and coordination between the various agencies with responsibility for the agricultural health and food safety system, and to identify the key priorities and activities needed to improve food safety along the food chain.\n\n### Question: What was Ricky Allport's professional role and what impact did his passing have on the Caribbean agricultural sector?","passages":[{"passage":"\"For me the real impact was that I was able to seize a moment and act on the question,\" he says, \"something that's normally in other industries but somehow mysteriously missing in medicine.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:9f15a130-7765-406b-b834-8c4e47ebcc62>"]},{"passage":"|Effect of Biochemical and Environmental Parameters on Lignification in Eucalyptus Lignin and Peroxidase Activity.

The focus of this work lies in finding the first- order derivatives of the diffracted field with respect to the physical parameters. This can be done by finite differences, but straightforward differentiation of the relations within RCWA gives a more accurate and faster way to find these derivatives. Periodic structures, called diffraction gratings, play an important role in optical lithography.

In order to further illustrate the key points from Chapter 4, this chapter contains a number of worked examples of questions about the effects of interventions. As we mentioned in the preface of the book, we believe that it can be easier to learn the process of critical appraisal when you see some worked examples of how it is done, and it is even better when the examples are from your own health profession. Therefore, this chapter (and Chapters 7, 9 and 11) contains examples from a range of health professions. Some of the clinical examples are relevant to more than one health profession.

It isn’t that there isn’t a problem. The virus and associated disease are real. But a good detective doesn’t try to nail a drug mule while ignoring the existence of the agent who loaded the mule. And a super detective might probe deeper and see how to dry up demand for the drug! Please translate my analogy terms to fit the case at hand! Consider a sample opinion from an agricultural researcher who was knighted for his work. Sir Albert Howard did his work at a time when agriculture was undergoing a radical transformation that discarded time proven traditional approaches in favour of economic driven technologies. World War I had produced a huge explosives industry and nitrogen producers were looking for peace time uses for their product. He would have agreed that a ‘one, two, three, blastoff’ approach was being applied and that multiple micro clues were being ignored. He wasn’t an advocate of faulted or inefficient agricultural from certain periods in the past, which he felt accounted for many past human difficulties but he did feel that many basic biology facts were being overlooked – both in past and in the new dollar driven approach that was taking hold. He was convinced through theory and research that soil must ‘live’ and that the associated mycorrhizal mechanism must be an essential link in plant nutrition and that this fact was being ignored in the new use of artificial fertilizers and associated support chemicals. His prediction of the outcome was written in 1940 – that’s a long time back – not a date very many living today experienced. Will his futuristic prediction prove accurate, eventually? Is it accurate already? (additional information on Albert Howard via links on the home page of this website)\n“because artificial plants, artificial animals, and artificial men are unhealthy and can only be protected from the parasites, whose duty it is to remove them, by means of poison sprays, vaccines and serums and an expensive system of patent medicines, panel doctors, hospitals and so forth. When the finance of crop production is considered together with that of the various social services which are needed to repair the consequences of an unsound agriculture, and when it is borne in mind that our greatest possession is a healthy, virile population, the cheapness of artificial manures disappears altogether. In the years to come, chemical manures will be considered as one of the greatest follies of the industrial epoch. The teachings of the agricultural economists of this period will be dismissed as superficial.”\nHoward was of the strong opinion that as men walk down the road of life, that time and chance may necessitate detours or occasional difficult going. He appreciated that one may stub a toe now and then, but for the vast majority of the time, human bodies are designed to work with amazing reliability - and for a life time, men should be able to focus on ‘Living’ and not be marginalized with constant repairs and major breakdowns and fears of such. If there are problems, is it that we are Monday morning lemons or just ignorant of simple and essential maintenance principles? Human life is finite but why not ‘Live’ while you are alive and then die quickly! Sputtering along at half throttle is not ‘Living’! We should be able to do better than giving the rotting dead the will to live. There is talk of covid 19 vaccine developers getting a Nobel prize. Is dealing with a single disease out of thousands note worthy? Sort of. But Howard proposed an immunity approach that kicked at all diseases – communicable as well as bigger and ongoing modern killers like heart disease, cancer, and diabedes. Should he get a posthumous Nobel prize? Life Style brilliance is really THE broad spectrum Super Vaccine! And it takes an army of Maestro Sherlocks to assemble the clues to develop that winner. Where are they in the herd of 'three count launch' detectives? And when one surfaces, is he beaten down as a heretic? Howard focused on agriculture method and its impact on plant, animal, and human health. The worrisome aspect is that this is only one underlying facet of the stability of current society. Is it possible that basic errors that Howard detected in agriculture also show up in most other underlying society support structures?

The Rockefeller and Moyne Commissions and the Irvine Committee are notable investigative mechanisms established during the early to mid-1900s. Their research made recommendations that revolutionized health care services in the Caribbean. Table 1 depicts deaths and infant mortality rates (per 1 000) for select Caribbean territories during the early 1900s. During this period, health care expenditure in the Caribbean ranged from a low of 8.9% of total expenditure in British Honduras and Montserrat to a high of 18.6% in Saint Kitts and Nevis and 19.6% in Saint Vincent. Other countries, such as Barbados, Jamaica, and Trinidad, spent 11.3%, 9.8%, and 9.2% of their budgets, respectively, on health care (6). The first half of the twentieth century brought two important health care milestones to the Caribbean: the establishment of the West Indies School of Public Health to train public health nurses and inspectors, and the establishment of the University College of the West Indies to train doctors. A PHC system gradually developed with the concept of the \"health team approach,\" the creation of medical districts, and the development of health centers to provide first-line health care (2). ALMA-ATA AND THE CARIBBEAN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE STRATEGY\nThe Declaration of Alma-Ata, made in 1978, encapsulates the principal processes and strategies for PHC and served as the linchpin for the call to \"Health for All by the Year 2000\" (1, 7). The Declaration highlighted the value of intersectoral linkages and political commitment and responsibility to attain this goal. Of key importance was the concept that socioeconomic development is critical to health care delivery and reform. In response to this call for action, Caribbean ministers of health, through the assistance of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the United Nations Children's Fund, the United States Agency for International Development, and the University of the West Indies (UWI), among others, convened a workshop in 1981 to develop a Caribbean strategy for PHC (8). Seven years later, PAHO conducted an evaluation of the PHC progress made in four countries, namely Anguilla, Barbados, Grenada, and Saint Lucia. Most of these countries had embarked on developing an intersectoral approach to the implementation of PHC through convening national intersectoral workshops, and the establishment of a PHC Intersectoral Committee in at least one country (8). In Jamaica, where a policy decision had been made in 1977 to expand PHC services, the pace was far advanced. The country's approach was documented in \"Primary Health Care: the Jamaican Perspective,\" and it was through this document that key contributions were made to the discussions at Alma-Ata (9). One of the outstanding goals laid out in this document was that there should be a PHC center within 10 miles (16 km) of every citizen. Acknowledging the shortage and poor utilization of human resources within the health sector, the Jamaican response was to train a cadre of community health aides as an \"interface between the community and the health delivery system for health promotion, health education, disease prevention, and follow-up of persons to ensure that they kept clinic appointments. . .\" (10). This training experiment was the innovative and visionary work of Sir Kenneth Standard and Olive Ennever of the UWI Department of Social and Preventative Medicine (now the Department of Community Health and Psychiatry). Success led to its adoption by several countries, such as Antigua, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent, as early as 1967before the Alma-Ata Conference. Other additions to the health care team included the school dental nurse and dental assistant in 1970; the nurse practitioner, 1978; and the pharmacy technician, 1980 (10). Increased collaboration within the Caribbean community, especially in the area of environmental health, was denoted by the development of the Caribbean Environmental Health Strategy and the establishment of the Pan Caribbean Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Program in the 1980s. The training and placement of national epidemiologists, the move towards the development of surveillance systems and computerized information systems (although at an uneven pace across the Caribbean), and the development of the advisory role of the Caribbean Epidemiology Center (CAREC) were among the important mileposts since the Alma-Ata Conference (8). Programs funded through local and international resources to upgrade unsatisfactory health facilities were implemented.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:4ac238e7-36fd-4283-bced-c249ab1b95d2>"]},{"passage":"Public policy and infrastructure\nCarr noted in 1985 (4) that, within a decade of the Declaration of Alma-Ata, Caribbean countries would make significant efforts to develop national health policies and programs. With the emerging epidemiological profile of diseases in the Caribbean, national health policies must illustrate public policy support for healthy living. The changing role of government, in light of health care privatization, does not relieve its role in policy development; in fact, it increases the need for standards and regulation. The successful adoption of the Caribbean Charter for Health Promotion (32) remains questionable. PHC services in the Caribbean are still oriented toward curative programs rather than preventive ones. This fact is further evidenced by the allocation of funds between the two areas. With an aging population, the need for more PHC facilities will increase significantly over time (30). This may require the development of poli- cies for \"geriatric-friendly\" services at all service institutionsprimary and secondary health care, as well as other economic and social institutions. Examples of such services may include facilities that provide live-in care and recreational activities for the elderly (nursing homes, elderly day care centers, etc. ), and wheelchair access and elder services in public and private spaces. Also important are the improvement and development of primary and secondary health care facilities and services, and the increased number of caregivers needed for the large numbers of persons who will suffer mortality and morbidity from injuries, HIV, and other maladies. Environmental issues and urbanization\nPopulation growth and increased urbanization have placed a significant strain on the network of social goods and services required to support communities (3). Unplanned development has resulted in the scattering of shantytowns across the landscape of various Caribbean countries. Lack of a safe water supply and appropriate facilities for waste and sewerage has increased the risk of disease transmission. Existing roads, housing, sewerage, and other infrastructure have often proven inadequate to meet the needs of a growing urban population. In addition, shrinking economies will be challenged to provide adequate employment opportunities. Unemployment is likely to have the spin-off effect of escalating illegal and criminal activity.

Bipolar affects approximately 2.6% of the adult population in the United States. Although bipolar symptoms can emerge at any time, the typical age of onset is between 18 and 25. Bipolar affects men and women equally. There are some factors that increase the risk of bipolar including: The manic phase may last one week or more and is characterized by increased energy and an elevated or irritable mood that is present for most of the day. Diagnosis requires the presence of three or more of these symptoms: Symptoms of hypomanic episodes are similar, but tend to be shorter in duration, lasting four days or more. Psychotic symptoms are not present during hypomanic episodes, and the symptoms are not so severe as to require hospitalization. Hypomanic symptoms are common among all the bipolar diagnoses, but manic episodes are symptomatic solely of bipolar I. The depressive phase of bipolar includes at least five symptoms of major depression that last for at least two weeks, including: While bipolar cannot be cured, it can be managed effectively. Psychotherapy can help people with bipolar by teaching them how to recognize triggers so they can understand or possibly avoid them, decrease negatively expressed emotions, and practice healthy coping skills. Finding a therapist or counselor with whom you can establish a healthy therapeutic relationship may help develop some of the following skills for managing bipolar: Some types of psychotherapy such as family-focused and dialectable therapies are effective in preventing relapses. Although the research clearly demonstrates that bipolar often has an organic ideology, psychotherapy has been proven to be an effective treatment. Medication is also commonly used in the treatment of bipolar. Another myth about bipolar is that it is only caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. While there is an organic component to it, bipolar is typically influenced by a variety of factors including environment and experience. Finally, it is a myth that people with bipolar cannot lead a normal life. Bipolar can be effectively managed with treatment, and many people with bipolar experience long periods of remission.

While imbalances in brain chemistry, particularly involving neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, are believed to play a significant role in the disorder, the exact causes of bipolar disorder are complex and multifaceted.\n\nResearch suggests that bipolar disorder likely results from a combination of genetic, biological, and environmental factors. Genetic predisposition is a significant risk factor, with studies indicating that individuals with a family history of bipolar disorder are more likely to develop the condition themselves. However, genetics alone do not determine the development of bipolar disorder, as not all individuals with a genetic predisposition will develop the condition.\n\nEnvironmental factors, such as stress, trauma, and significant life changes, can also trigger episodes of bipolar disorder in individuals who are genetically predisposed. Additionally, brain structure and function may also contribute to the disorder, with studies showing differences in brain regions involved in mood regulation and impulse control.\n\nIn summary, while brain chemistry issues are a significant component in the development of bipolar disorder, it is not the sole cause.

View all articles by David Oliver\n\nWhat Are the Causes? Bipolar disorder results from a chemical imbalance in the brain as a result of multiple causes that vary between individuals. Studies conclusively show that genetics and environmental factors both play a part in causing symptoms. Certain genes are linked to bipolar disorder. Most research has not been conclusive, but findings have found potential causes in the genes related to serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, and cell growth. No studies report findings with 100 percent confidence. Many childhood behaviors and habits have been linked to people who develop bipolar disorder as adults or adolescence. There is a strong correlation between depression, mood abnormalities, ADHD, and stimulant use. Certain environmental components can lead to bipolar disorder. Traumatic events and social relationships are factors that can affect whether a person will be diagnosed as bipolar. Many children who experience abuse and posttraumatic stress disorder have a chance of developing bipolar disorder later on. Some studies have shown that sensitivity to melatonin is an indicator of bipolar disorder. In the sample groups, individuals with bipolar disorder demonstrated sensitivity to light, causing an extreme drop in melatonin. In corresponding studies, the recovered bipolar patients showed no sensitivity to light. Certain psychological functions have a role in triggering bipolar disorder. Extreme stress can cause people to experience extreme fluctuations in mood. A person might start to feel critical, depressed, and impulsive. Slowly, a person will bipolar disorder may start to lose self control and behave irrationally. Who's at Risk? Bipolar disorder affects men and women of all ages. Most bipolar patients are diagnosed by the time they are adolescents; however, a person of any age can develop symptoms for the first time. Children can also show signs of bipolar disorder. It is believed that heredity plays a role in bipolar disorder since people with a family history of the condition are likely to have the condition, themselves. People develop symptoms for a variety of reasons that are both genetic and environmental. It is difficult to tell who will develop bipolar disorder and who will not. If you notice that you experience extreme mood swings, you may be bipolar. Do not take your symptoms lightly, especially if you notice ups and downs over an extended period of time. There are many stereotypes about people who are bipolar, and as a result, people might be afraid to talk about their symptoms. Understand that a large group of people are equally at risk. You should not feel ashamed, especially when there are effective treatments available.\n\nBipolar Disorder (cont.) In this Article\nWhat are the risk factors for bipolar disorder? Scientists are learning about the possible causes of bipolar disorder. Most scientists agree that there is no single cause. Rather, many factors likely act together to produce the illness or increase risk. Bipolar disorder tends to run in families, so researchers are looking for genes that may increase a person's chance of developing the illness. Genes are the \"building blocks\" of heredity. They help control how the body and brain work and grow. Genes are contained inside a person's cells that are passed down from parents to children. Children with a parent or sibling who has bipolar disorder are four to six times more likely to develop the illness, compared with children who do not have a family history of bipolar disorder. However, most children with a family history of bipolar disorder will not develop the illness. Genetic research on bipolar disorder is being helped by advances in technology. This type of research is now much quicker and more far-reaching than in the past. One example is the launch of the Bipolar Disorder Phenome Database, funded in part by NIMH. Using the database, scientists will be able to link visible signs of the disorder with the genes that may influence them. So far, researchers using this database found that most people with bipolar disorder had:\nThe researchers also identified certain traits that appeared to run in families, including:\nScientists continue to study these traits, which may help them find the genes that cause bipolar disorder some day. But genes are not the only risk factor for bipolar disorder. Studies of identical twins have shown that the twin of a person with bipolar illness does not always develop the disorder. This is important because identical twins share all of the same genes. The study results suggest factors besides genes are also at work. Rather, it is likely that many different genes and a person's environment are involved. However, scientists do not yet fully understand how these factors interact to cause bipolar disorder. Brain structure and functioning\nBrain-imaging studies are helping scientists learn what happens in the brain of a person with bipolar disorder. Newer brain-imaging tools, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), allow researchers to take pictures of the living brain at work. These tools help scientists study the brain's structure and activity. Some imaging studies show how the brains of people with bipolar disorder may differ from the brains of healthy people or people with other mental disorders. For example, one study using MRI found that the pattern of brain development in children with bipolar disorder was similar to that in children with \"multi-dimensional impairment,\" a disorder that causes symptoms that overlap somewhat with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. This suggests that the common pattern of brain development may be linked to general risk for unstable moods. Learning more about these differences, along with information gained from genetic studies, helps scientists better understand bipolar disorder. Someday scientists may be able to predict which types of treatment will work most effectively. They may even find ways to prevent bipolar disorder. How is bipolar disorder diagnosed? The first step in getting a proper diagnosis is to talk to a doctor, who may conduct a physical examination, an interview, and lab tests. Bipolar disorder cannot currently be identified through a blood test or a brain scan, but these tests can help rule out other contributing factors, such as a stroke or brain tumor. If the problems are not caused by other illnesses, the doctor may conduct a mental health evaluation. The doctor may also provide a referral to a trained mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist, who is experienced in diagnosing and treating bipolar disorder. The doctor or mental health professional should conduct a complete diagnostic evaluation. He or she should discuss any family history of bipolar disorder or other mental illnesses and get a complete history of symptoms. The doctor or mental health professionals should also talk to the person's close relatives or spouse and note how they describe the person's symptoms and family medical history. People with bipolar disorder are more likely to seek help when they are depressed than when experiencing mania or hypomania. Therefore, a careful medical history is needed to assure that bipolar disorder is not mistakenly diagnosed as major depressive disorder, which is also called unipolar depression.\n\nIf you’re on this page, you, or someone you love, may have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. That can be scary, as bipolar is a serious mental condition that short-circuits the brain’s ability to think clearly and causes states of extreme ups and extreme downs, called mania and depression. Your mind is probably reeling, and you’re chock full of questions. One of the first you’re probably asking is: Where did this come from? Did I do something to cause this? Many people with bipolar wonder the same thing. We’ve the answers you need. Tell Me Exactly What Bipolar Disorder Is, First\nEverybody goes through mood ups and downs, but in bipolar disorder, a person experiences pronounced episodes of lows (depression) and highs (mania). And these mood swings can interfere with day-to-day life, making it hard to do right by your relationships, function efficiently at your job, and take care of your own everyday needs—getting the laundry or grocery shopping done, getting enough sleep, that sort of thing. The good news is that treatment can make a huge difference. In order to be diagnosed with bipolar, you must have experienced at least one episode of mania or hypomania, a milder form of mania. If that’s the case, then docs can delve deeper to find out which of the four types of bipolar you have:\nBipolar I: This is the most severe type. People with bipolar I typically experience severe cycles of mania and depression. Bipolar II: Bipolar II comes with that milder form of mania, hypomania, as well as the typical depressive episodes. Cyclothymic Bipolar: Both the depression and mania are on the mild side. Unspecified Bipolar: Here, the symptoms are like bipolar, but they’re not frequent or lengthy enough to warrant the diagnosis of one of the other types of bipolar. Is There One Cause of Bipolar Disorder? That’s a very common question, and the short answer is no. There is no one thing that causes or leads to bipolar disorder. Genetic, psychological, environmental, and social factors are at play, though experts presume that bipolar disorder can primarily be blamed on biology — more specifically, the pre-frontal cortex, the part of the brain that’s in charge of processing emotions, learning and memory, reasoning, and judgment. Let’s look a little deeper into the probable causes of bipolar disorder. Genetics almost undoubtedly play a part in bipolar disorder. While an exact gene or combo of genes has yet to be identified (if it even exists), research has shown that two genes, CACNA1 and ANK3, may make you more susceptible to developing the disorder. But not everyone with bipolar disorder has these two genes, so they’re unlikely to be the primary cause of the disorder. In addition to those genes, researchers suspect there could be various other small variations in genes that are involved as opposed to a large variation in a single gene. Also, this could not be the case—experts just don't know yet. Lots to still learn! What we do know with some certainty is that genes are somehow involved, since bipolar tends to run in families. Research shows:\n- The lifetime risk of the average person developing bipolar is 2%. - If you have a first-degree relative who has the condition (mother, father, brother, or sister), your risk is now 5-10% , which is more than double the average person. - If you have an identical twin who has the condition, your risk of developing it as well jumps to between 40% and 70%. Bipolar affects men and women in equal numbers. There are some differences:\n- Women are more likely to experience rapid cycling, which means they’ll go through many mood ups and downs in a given year. - Women experience mixed episodes, when mania and depression happen at the same time or in quick succession without a stretch of time in between, more often than men. - Women are more likely to suffer from bipolar II than men. - While the average age of developing the disorder is around 25, men often develop the disorder at a younger age than women. - Though not absolute, men often show more symptoms of a manic episode first, while women usually experience a depressive episode initially.\n\nWhat Does NOT Cause Bipolar Disorder\nI receive so many emails and phone calls from people confused about what causes bipolar disorder. At least once every few weeks, someone contacts me wondering if the bipolar experienced by their loved one or themselves is the result of someone placing a curse on them. Although people who have untreated, unmanaged bipolar disorder may feel cursed, this is NOT a cause of the disorder. Below are a few of the other things that people may think cause bipolar disorder but, in fact, do not. Some may cause a person that already had bipolar disorder to exhibit symptoms, but these are not causes of the disorder. Physical, mental, or sexual abuse: Bipolar disorder is not the result of abuse. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder or an anxiety disorder may be the result of abuse but bipolar is not. However, if a person has undiagnosed bipolar disorder, or even if a person has well-managed bipolar disorder, abuse can certainly be a stress-related trigger for an episode. Too much\/too little attention\/attention seeking: If a person receives too much or too little attention, whether as a child or adult, this is NOT a cause of bipolar disorder. The person with bipolar is not using it to seek attention; this is NOT the cause of the disorder. Stress: It is often believed that a person that is under stress 'gets' bipolar disorder. Stress is a major trigger for bipolar episodes and symptoms. It is not the CAUSE; it is only a trigger for an existing disorder to come to light. Drug or alcohol abuse: It is a very common misconception that substance abuse causes bipolar disorder. This is because a person that has bipolar and is also abusing substances can exhibit symptoms and episodes as a result of the mental confusion caused by substance abuse. But the substance abuse is NOT the cause of their bipolar disorder. Birth Order: It doesn't matter if a person is the eldest child, middle child, youngest child or an only child. If they have bipolar disorder, it has nothing to do with the order in which they were born. In fact, the number of parents in the home or being raised in an orphanage or foster home is not the cause of bipolar either. Financial Situation: Rich people and poor people as well as middle income people all get bipolar disorder at the same rate. It is not caused by money or the lack of money. Financial stresses can bring on episodes of bipolar or worsen symptoms but the money issues are NOT the cause of the disorder itself. Hormones or Sex Drive: Many people experiencing a bipolar episode may seek sexual attention or practice risky sexual behavior, blaming it on their hormones. This is NOT a cause of bipolar disorder; instead, it is a symptom of an existing disorder. Menopause or mid-life crisis: See hormones above. Changes in hormones can worsen symptoms of an existing disorder but do NOT cause the disorder in any way. Fear of the changes occurring due to aging may well trigger symptoms but do not cause them. Environment: Often, people believe that being raised by a parent that has bipolar disorder or being around people that have the disorder can cause a person to become bipolar, similar to catching a cold. Environment is never the cause of bipolar. The stress and frustration of being around people that are in the throes of bipolar episodes can well bring on symptoms in a person that already had the disorder, whether diagnosed or not, but the stress does not CAUSE the disorder. Bipolar disorder is not contagious. However, due to the heredity connection, those raised in a home where others have the disorder makes them more likely to also have the disorder but the CAUSE is not the environment at all. Accident\/illness\/health problems: Bipolar disorder is not caused by an accident, a long or short illness or the presence of health problems. The stress of having health concerns may bring out symptoms but the cause is not health-related. Being dropped on the head as a baby is not a cause. Having a really awful car accident is not the cause. Being confined to a wheelchair is not a cause of bipolar disorder, either. Side effect of a medication: Bipolar disorder is not caused by taking a prescribed (or street-obtained) medication. If a person has bipolar symptoms while taking a medication, it could be a reaction.\n\nThrough brain scans like functional MRIs, experts have found subtle differences in the brains of people with bipolar. The tricky thing is that it’s unclear whether these changes are the reason why people develop the disorder, or the changes are because of the disorder. Here are the key differences:\n- Overactive in people with bipolar disorder: the amygdala, which is crucial for processing emotions\n- Underactive in people with bipolar disorder: the hippocampus, which plays a crucial role in learning and memory, as well as other vital neurons in the prefrontal cortex that relate to planning complex cognitive behavior, personality expression, decision making, and moderating social behavior\nThis overactive\/underactive situation may be why, during a manic episode, the executive function is impaired while emotions are heightened and uninhibited. Other imaging tests have led experts to theorize that in people with bipolar, it’s possible that something may have happened to the brain in its early development that results in decreased connections among prefrontal networks and limbic structures, especially the amygdala. In other words, the fine-level connections in parts of the brain are disrupted and somehow those circuits are misaligned or misfiring. Age of Father at Conception\nIt sounds wild, we know, but stay with us here. In one study of over 6,800 people with bipolar disorder, after adjusting for several possible contributing factors (such as parental education, income, and history of psychiatric hospitalization, as well as maternal age), fathers who were 45 years and older were six times more likely to have a child with bipolar disorder than men who were 20 to 24 years old. Any Other Factors That May Contribute to Developing Bipolar? As we described earlier, experts have good reason to believe that biology is mainly to blame for bipolar disorder—in particular, specific areas in the brain that over- or under-produce particular brain chemicals. However, it’s possible that certain environmental factors may trigger the disease in those who were already susceptible. That’s not to say that you’d get the disease if you weren’t predisposed to it in the first place. But it’s conceivable that bipolar could lie idle, only activating if certain factors arise. These may include:\n- Stressful events. Highly disturbing happenings like divorce, experiencing a death of a family member, or losing a job can set off a bipolar incident. Also, people who’ve experienced a traumatic event like sexual or physical abuse, neglect, or death of a parent early in life have an increased risk of bipolar later. - Sleep disturbances. Research found that 25% to 65% of people with bipolar had experienced a “social rhythm disruption”—science speak for daily routines that can impact the sleep\/wake cycle—before an episode of mania. - Drugs and alcohol. More than 60% of people with bipolar disorder abuse alcohol or drugs. The classic chicken\/egg questions arises here (“which came first?”), and the answer is, it’s likely bidirectional. That is, people with bipolar take more risks, which allows for more alcohol and substance abuse, which may lead to brain and social stressors that increase the likelihood of the disorder. Suffice it to say, there is a lot we still don't know about the causes of bipolar disorder. But that doesn’t make it any less real for the people experiencing it. If you think you or someone you know might be suffering from bipolar, check out our Bipolar Symptoms page to learn more about what this illness looks like.\n\nSomeone that qualifies as being in a state of rapid-cycling experiences four or more episodes of mania or depression within a given year. This manifested form of BPD may come and go over time and can occur at any point throughout the disorder. Types Of Bipolar Disorder\nAlthough bipolar is known to present itself in many different ways, there are four main types of BPD that are each characterized by a unique set of symptoms: Bipolar I, Bipolar II, Cyclothymia, and Other or Unspecified Bipolar. Bipolar I is seen as the most classic form of the manic-depressive disorder, in that a person will experience at least one mixed or manic episode. The manic episodes typically last at least 7 days, and some symptoms can be so severe that the person may need to be hospitalized. Mixed episodes where both hypomanic and depressive symptoms are present is a common feature of bipolar I. Although not in all cases, bipolar I usually involves at least one depressive episode, lasting about 2 weeks. Bipolar II is characterized by a pattern of depressive and hypomanic episodes, but full-blown manic episodes are not experienced. Cyclothymia is defined by cyclical mood swings that occur on a fairly regular basis. The symptoms of hypomania and depression in this type of BPD are typically less severe in form but can still have a serious negative impact on a person’s life. Cyclothymia can also progress into full-fledged manic or depressive episodes. Causes And Triggers Of Bipolar Disorder\nThere is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the cause of bipolar disorder, but scientific research suggests that the onset of these mood disorders likely results from a multitude of factors and the interactions that occur between them. Bipolar disorder is known to run in families, but genes are not the only thing at play here. While some inherit a genetic vulnerability to the disorder, many with the same genetic predisposition never develop the illness. This alone shows that there are other factors aside from genes that are responsible. Environmental factors, such as stress or loss can act as triggers creating new episodes or exacerbating existing symptoms. Sleep deprivation and substance abuse are also known to trigger and exacerbate symptoms of BPD. The variations in severity coupled with the interplay of biological, genetic, psychological, and psychosocial elements are what cause these disorders to be so complex, and therefore difficult to treat, especially when substance abuse and bipolar disorder are combined. Subjective reports indicate that marijuana use is intended mostly to relieve the positive symptoms of the schizophrenic condition. People with this mental illness may use cannabis to relieve the psychological strain caused by delusion or hallucination; or “chill them out” and relieve the effects of physical or verbal agitation. The Brain And Bipolar Disorder\nGiven its vast complexity, our understanding for the brain’s interworking mechanisms remains quite limited. New theories about communicative neural processes arise as science continues to progress—keeping the field of abnormal psychology and the way we treat mental health disorders always changing. In cases of bipolar disorder, it’s pretty clear that emotion seems to overtake behavior, but new research has given us a glimpse into the processes and mechanisms by which this happens: the brain’s emotional centers are exhibiting too much activity, whereas the judgment and impulse control centers (located in the frontal lobes) exhibit too little. This has led experts to believe that much of bipolar disorder’s underlying cause resides in the circuitry of the brain that contributes to our overall functionality. Brain chemicals called neurotransmitters serve as the messengers within these circuits; they travel through our brain’s neural pathways to allow different parts (or “hubs”) to communicate with one another. Neurotransmitter imbalances disrupt and alter the communicative routs between brain cells, causing impairment to processes such as mood regulation upon which we rely and ultimately the attributes that make us who we are. The three key neurotransmitters responsible for brain and bodily function, noradrenaline (norepinephrine), serotonin, and dopamine, are believed to play an important role in the onset of BPD.\n\nOther brain components which have been proposed to play a role are the mitochondria, and a sodium ATPase pump, causing cynical periods of poor neuron firing (depression) and hypersensitive neuron firing (mania). This may only apply for type I, but type II apparently results from a large confluence of factors. Circadian rhythms and melatonin activity also seem to be altered. - Environmental: Evidence suggests that environmental factors play a significant role in the development and cause of bipolar disorder and that individual psychosocial variables may interact with genetic dispositions. There is fairly consistent evidence from prospective studies that recent life events and interpersonal relationships contribute to the likelihood of onsets and recurrences of bipolar mood episodes, as they do for onsets and recurrences of unipolar depression. There have been repeated findings that between a third and a half of adults diagnosed with bipolar disorder report traumatic\/abusive experiences in childhood, which is associated on average with earlier onset, a worse course, and more co-occurring disorders such as PTSD. The total number of reported stressful events in childhood is higher in those with an adult diagnosis of bipolar spectrum disorder compared to those without, particularly events stemming from a harsh environment rather than from the child’s own behaviour. Fairly experiences of adversity and conflict are likely to make subsequent developmental challenges in adolescence more difficult and are likely a potentiating factor in those at risk of developing bipolar disorder.

These tools help scientists study the brain's structure and activity. Some imaging studies show how the brains of people with bipolar disorder may differ from the brains of healthy people or people with other mental disorders. For example, one study using MRI found that the pattern of brain development in children with bipolar disorder was similar to that in children with \"multi-dimensional impairment,\" a disorder that causes symptoms that overlap somewhat with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. This suggests that the common pattern of brain development may be linked to general risk for unstable moods. Learning more about these differences, along with information gained from genetic studies, helps scientists better understand bipolar disorder. Someday scientists may be able to predict which types of treatment will work most effectively. They may even find ways to prevent bipolar disorder. How is bipolar disorder diagnosed? The first step in getting a proper diagnosis is to talk to a doctor, who may conduct a physical examination, an interview, and lab tests. Bipolar disorder cannot currently be identified through a blood test or a brain scan, but these tests can help rule out other contributing factors, such as a stroke or brain tumor. If the problems are not caused by other illnesses, the doctor may conduct a mental health evaluation. The doctor may also provide a referral to a trained mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist, who is experienced in diagnosing and treating bipolar disorder. The doctor or mental health professional should conduct a complete diagnostic evaluation. He or she should discuss any family history of bipolar disorder or other mental illnesses and get a complete history of symptoms. The doctor or mental health professionals should also talk to the person's close relatives or spouse and note how they describe the person's symptoms and family medical history. People with bipolar disorder are more likely to seek help when they are depressed than when experiencing mania or hypomania. Therefore, a careful medical history is needed to assure that bipolar disorder is not mistakenly diagnosed as major depressive disorder, which is also called unipolar depression.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:83a19198-4d7a-4dd9-b850-5ad97b6a05ea>"]},{"passage":"If you’re on this page, you, or someone you love, may have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. That can be scary, as bipolar is a serious mental condition that short-circuits the brain’s ability to think clearly and causes states of extreme ups and extreme downs, called mania and depression. Your mind is probably reeling, and you’re chock full of questions. One of the first you’re probably asking is: Where did this come from? Did I do something to cause this? Many people with bipolar wonder the same thing. We’ve the answers you need. Tell Me Exactly What Bipolar Disorder Is, First\nEverybody goes through mood ups and downs, but in bipolar disorder, a person experiences pronounced episodes of lows (depression) and highs (mania). And these mood swings can interfere with day-to-day life, making it hard to do right by your relationships, function efficiently at your job, and take care of your own everyday needs—getting the laundry or grocery shopping done, getting enough sleep, that sort of thing. The good news is that treatment can make a huge difference. In order to be diagnosed with bipolar, you must have experienced at least one episode of mania or hypomania, a milder form of mania. If that’s the case, then docs can delve deeper to find out which of the four types of bipolar you have:\nBipolar I: This is the most severe type. People with bipolar I typically experience severe cycles of mania and depression. Bipolar II: Bipolar II comes with that milder form of mania, hypomania, as well as the typical depressive episodes. Cyclothymic Bipolar: Both the depression and mania are on the mild side. Unspecified Bipolar: Here, the symptoms are like bipolar, but they’re not frequent or lengthy enough to warrant the diagnosis of one of the other types of bipolar. Is There One Cause of Bipolar Disorder? That’s a very common question, and the short answer is no. There is no one thing that causes or leads to bipolar disorder. Genetic, psychological, environmental, and social factors are at play, though experts presume that bipolar disorder can primarily be blamed on biology — more specifically, the pre-frontal cortex, the part of the brain that’s in charge of processing emotions, learning and memory, reasoning, and judgment. Let’s look a little deeper into the probable causes of bipolar disorder. Genetics almost undoubtedly play a part in bipolar disorder. While an exact gene or combo of genes has yet to be identified (if it even exists), research has shown that two genes, CACNA1 and ANK3, may make you more susceptible to developing the disorder. But not everyone with bipolar disorder has these two genes, so they’re unlikely to be the primary cause of the disorder. In addition to those genes, researchers suspect there could be various other small variations in genes that are involved as opposed to a large variation in a single gene. Also, this could not be the case—experts just don't know yet. Lots to still learn! What we do know with some certainty is that genes are somehow involved, since bipolar tends to run in families. Research shows:\n- The lifetime risk of the average person developing bipolar is 2%. - If you have a first-degree relative who has the condition (mother, father, brother, or sister), your risk is now 5-10% , which is more than double the average person. - If you have an identical twin who has the condition, your risk of developing it as well jumps to between 40% and 70%. Bipolar affects men and women in equal numbers. There are some differences:\n- Women are more likely to experience rapid cycling, which means they’ll go through many mood ups and downs in a given year. - Women experience mixed episodes, when mania and depression happen at the same time or in quick succession without a stretch of time in between, more often than men. - Women are more likely to suffer from bipolar II than men. - While the average age of developing the disorder is around 25, men often develop the disorder at a younger age than women. - Though not absolute, men often show more symptoms of a manic episode first, while women usually experience a depressive episode initially.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:2dc54dac-5164-4672-ae91-d54682de3461>"]},{"passage":"What Does NOT Cause Bipolar Disorder\nI receive so many emails and phone calls from people confused about what causes bipolar disorder. At least once every few weeks, someone contacts me wondering if the bipolar experienced by their loved one or themselves is the result of someone placing a curse on them. Although people who have untreated, unmanaged bipolar disorder may feel cursed, this is NOT a cause of the disorder. Below are a few of the other things that people may think cause bipolar disorder but, in fact, do not. Some may cause a person that already had bipolar disorder to exhibit symptoms, but these are not causes of the disorder. Physical, mental, or sexual abuse: Bipolar disorder is not the result of abuse. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder or an anxiety disorder may be the result of abuse but bipolar is not. However, if a person has undiagnosed bipolar disorder, or even if a person has well-managed bipolar disorder, abuse can certainly be a stress-related trigger for an episode. Too much\/too little attention\/attention seeking: If a person receives too much or too little attention, whether as a child or adult, this is NOT a cause of bipolar disorder. The person with bipolar is not using it to seek attention; this is NOT the cause of the disorder. Stress: It is often believed that a person that is under stress 'gets' bipolar disorder. Stress is a major trigger for bipolar episodes and symptoms. It is not the CAUSE; it is only a trigger for an existing disorder to come to light. Drug or alcohol abuse: It is a very common misconception that substance abuse causes bipolar disorder. This is because a person that has bipolar and is also abusing substances can exhibit symptoms and episodes as a result of the mental confusion caused by substance abuse. But the substance abuse is NOT the cause of their bipolar disorder. Birth Order: It doesn't matter if a person is the eldest child, middle child, youngest child or an only child. If they have bipolar disorder, it has nothing to do with the order in which they were born. In fact, the number of parents in the home or being raised in an orphanage or foster home is not the cause of bipolar either. Financial Situation: Rich people and poor people as well as middle income people all get bipolar disorder at the same rate. It is not caused by money or the lack of money. Financial stresses can bring on episodes of bipolar or worsen symptoms but the money issues are NOT the cause of the disorder itself. Hormones or Sex Drive: Many people experiencing a bipolar episode may seek sexual attention or practice risky sexual behavior, blaming it on their hormones. This is NOT a cause of bipolar disorder; instead, it is a symptom of an existing disorder. Menopause or mid-life crisis: See hormones above. Changes in hormones can worsen symptoms of an existing disorder but do NOT cause the disorder in any way. Fear of the changes occurring due to aging may well trigger symptoms but do not cause them. Environment: Often, people believe that being raised by a parent that has bipolar disorder or being around people that have the disorder can cause a person to become bipolar, similar to catching a cold. Environment is never the cause of bipolar. The stress and frustration of being around people that are in the throes of bipolar episodes can well bring on symptoms in a person that already had the disorder, whether diagnosed or not, but the stress does not CAUSE the disorder. Bipolar disorder is not contagious. However, due to the heredity connection, those raised in a home where others have the disorder makes them more likely to also have the disorder but the CAUSE is not the environment at all. Accident\/illness\/health problems: Bipolar disorder is not caused by an accident, a long or short illness or the presence of health problems. The stress of having health concerns may bring out symptoms but the cause is not health-related. Being dropped on the head as a baby is not a cause. Having a really awful car accident is not the cause. Being confined to a wheelchair is not a cause of bipolar disorder, either. Side effect of a medication: Bipolar disorder is not caused by taking a prescribed (or street-obtained) medication. If a person has bipolar symptoms while taking a medication, it could be a reaction.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:0eb6fa21-9b59-4f9d-9cd9-85845d009b8b>"]},{"passage":"Through brain scans like functional MRIs, experts have found subtle differences in the brains of people with bipolar. The tricky thing is that it’s unclear whether these changes are the reason why people develop the disorder, or the changes are because of the disorder. Here are the key differences:\n- Overactive in people with bipolar disorder: the amygdala, which is crucial for processing emotions\n- Underactive in people with bipolar disorder: the hippocampus, which plays a crucial role in learning and memory, as well as other vital neurons in the prefrontal cortex that relate to planning complex cognitive behavior, personality expression, decision making, and moderating social behavior\nThis overactive\/underactive situation may be why, during a manic episode, the executive function is impaired while emotions are heightened and uninhibited. Other imaging tests have led experts to theorize that in people with bipolar, it’s possible that something may have happened to the brain in its early development that results in decreased connections among prefrontal networks and limbic structures, especially the amygdala. In other words, the fine-level connections in parts of the brain are disrupted and somehow those circuits are misaligned or misfiring. Age of Father at Conception\nIt sounds wild, we know, but stay with us here. In one study of over 6,800 people with bipolar disorder, after adjusting for several possible contributing factors (such as parental education, income, and history of psychiatric hospitalization, as well as maternal age), fathers who were 45 years and older were six times more likely to have a child with bipolar disorder than men who were 20 to 24 years old. Any Other Factors That May Contribute to Developing Bipolar? As we described earlier, experts have good reason to believe that biology is mainly to blame for bipolar disorder—in particular, specific areas in the brain that over- or under-produce particular brain chemicals. However, it’s possible that certain environmental factors may trigger the disease in those who were already susceptible. That’s not to say that you’d get the disease if you weren’t predisposed to it in the first place. But it’s conceivable that bipolar could lie idle, only activating if certain factors arise. These may include:\n- Stressful events. Highly disturbing happenings like divorce, experiencing a death of a family member, or losing a job can set off a bipolar incident. Also, people who’ve experienced a traumatic event like sexual or physical abuse, neglect, or death of a parent early in life have an increased risk of bipolar later. - Sleep disturbances. Research found that 25% to 65% of people with bipolar had experienced a “social rhythm disruption”—science speak for daily routines that can impact the sleep\/wake cycle—before an episode of mania. - Drugs and alcohol. More than 60% of people with bipolar disorder abuse alcohol or drugs. The classic chicken\/egg questions arises here (“which came first?”), and the answer is, it’s likely bidirectional. That is, people with bipolar take more risks, which allows for more alcohol and substance abuse, which may lead to brain and social stressors that increase the likelihood of the disorder. Suffice it to say, there is a lot we still don't know about the causes of bipolar disorder. But that doesn’t make it any less real for the people experiencing it. If you think you or someone you know might be suffering from bipolar, check out our Bipolar Symptoms page to learn more about what this illness looks like.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:2dc54dac-5164-4672-ae91-d54682de3461>"]},{"passage":"Someone that qualifies as being in a state of rapid-cycling experiences four or more episodes of mania or depression within a given year. This manifested form of BPD may come and go over time and can occur at any point throughout the disorder. Types Of Bipolar Disorder\nAlthough bipolar is known to present itself in many different ways, there are four main types of BPD that are each characterized by a unique set of symptoms: Bipolar I, Bipolar II, Cyclothymia, and Other or Unspecified Bipolar. Bipolar I is seen as the most classic form of the manic-depressive disorder, in that a person will experience at least one mixed or manic episode. The manic episodes typically last at least 7 days, and some symptoms can be so severe that the person may need to be hospitalized. Mixed episodes where both hypomanic and depressive symptoms are present is a common feature of bipolar I. Although not in all cases, bipolar I usually involves at least one depressive episode, lasting about 2 weeks. Bipolar II is characterized by a pattern of depressive and hypomanic episodes, but full-blown manic episodes are not experienced. Cyclothymia is defined by cyclical mood swings that occur on a fairly regular basis. The symptoms of hypomania and depression in this type of BPD are typically less severe in form but can still have a serious negative impact on a person’s life. Cyclothymia can also progress into full-fledged manic or depressive episodes. Causes And Triggers Of Bipolar Disorder\nThere is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the cause of bipolar disorder, but scientific research suggests that the onset of these mood disorders likely results from a multitude of factors and the interactions that occur between them. Bipolar disorder is known to run in families, but genes are not the only thing at play here. While some inherit a genetic vulnerability to the disorder, many with the same genetic predisposition never develop the illness. This alone shows that there are other factors aside from genes that are responsible. Environmental factors, such as stress or loss can act as triggers creating new episodes or exacerbating existing symptoms. Sleep deprivation and substance abuse are also known to trigger and exacerbate symptoms of BPD. The variations in severity coupled with the interplay of biological, genetic, psychological, and psychosocial elements are what cause these disorders to be so complex, and therefore difficult to treat, especially when substance abuse and bipolar disorder are combined. Subjective reports indicate that marijuana use is intended mostly to relieve the positive symptoms of the schizophrenic condition. People with this mental illness may use cannabis to relieve the psychological strain caused by delusion or hallucination; or “chill them out” and relieve the effects of physical or verbal agitation. The Brain And Bipolar Disorder\nGiven its vast complexity, our understanding for the brain’s interworking mechanisms remains quite limited. New theories about communicative neural processes arise as science continues to progress—keeping the field of abnormal psychology and the way we treat mental health disorders always changing. In cases of bipolar disorder, it’s pretty clear that emotion seems to overtake behavior, but new research has given us a glimpse into the processes and mechanisms by which this happens: the brain’s emotional centers are exhibiting too much activity, whereas the judgment and impulse control centers (located in the frontal lobes) exhibit too little. This has led experts to believe that much of bipolar disorder’s underlying cause resides in the circuitry of the brain that contributes to our overall functionality. Brain chemicals called neurotransmitters serve as the messengers within these circuits; they travel through our brain’s neural pathways to allow different parts (or “hubs”) to communicate with one another. Neurotransmitter imbalances disrupt and alter the communicative routs between brain cells, causing impairment to processes such as mood regulation upon which we rely and ultimately the attributes that make us who we are. The three key neurotransmitters responsible for brain and bodily function, noradrenaline (norepinephrine), serotonin, and dopamine, are believed to play an important role in the onset of BPD.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:1d2d8a66-50a6-4fd5-8dde-c4d65c7a4573>"]},{"passage":"Other brain components which have been proposed to play a role are the mitochondria, and a sodium ATPase pump, causing cynical periods of poor neuron firing (depression) and hypersensitive neuron firing (mania). This may only apply for type I, but type II apparently results from a large confluence of factors. Circadian rhythms and melatonin activity also seem to be altered. - Environmental: Evidence suggests that environmental factors play a significant role in the development and cause of bipolar disorder and that individual psychosocial variables may interact with genetic dispositions. There is fairly consistent evidence from prospective studies that recent life events and interpersonal relationships contribute to the likelihood of onsets and recurrences of bipolar mood episodes, as they do for onsets and recurrences of unipolar depression. There have been repeated findings that between a third and a half of adults diagnosed with bipolar disorder report traumatic\/abusive experiences in childhood, which is associated on average with earlier onset, a worse course, and more co-occurring disorders such as PTSD. The total number of reported stressful events in childhood is higher in those with an adult diagnosis of bipolar spectrum disorder compared to those without, particularly events stemming from a harsh environment rather than from the child’s own behaviour. Fairly experiences of adversity and conflict are likely to make subsequent developmental challenges in adolescence more difficult and are likely a potentiating factor in those at risk of developing bipolar disorder.

Its routes and Design details\nThis infrastructure has two lanes in each direction and two road sections (36.94km long section and 12.68km long link road). The speed limit on this road ranges between 50km\/ -100km\/h. Its 36.94km long section is divided into two parts whereby the first 24.9km stretch of the sections starts at a point on the Kampala Northern Bypass and runs along the new route before ending at Abayita ababiri. The 12.04km section starts at the Interchange (Abayita ababiri) and winds along the existing Kampala-Entebbe road. 7.4km of it was widened and 4.64km upgraded to the latest standards. Apart from that, its 12.68km long roads originate from the highway at Kajjansi interchange and continue eastwards up to Munyonyo. Bridges and Interchanges on the Expressway\nAdding to the four interchanges at Kajjansi, Busega, Lweza and Mpala, this expressway features nineteen over-bridges and eighteen underpasses that provide access to other areas around. Besides that, three main toll plazas were built on the expressway at Mpala, Kajjansi and Busega. Mpala and Kajjansi toll plazas have five gates. The Busega toll plaza differs itself unique with six toll gates. Moreover, two suspension bridges that measure 200m and 500m by length were put up over the Lubiji swamp in Busega and Kyengera. Its highway includes a 75m long bridge at Kajjansi and the 1.45m long suspension bridge over Nambigirwa swamp. The 240 pillars that support Nambigirwa swamp have a lifespan of 100 years and were installed to a depth of 55m. The Main Contractors\nUNRA awarded the design-build contract to China Communication Construction Company in October 2010. Then in May 2012, Beijing Expressway Supervision was selected as the consulting engineer for the supervision of the design and construction of this road. The site project management, investigations and laboratory tests, and geotechnical survey services for the expressway were provided between January 2012 and 2013 by the Ugandan consulting firm Project Management and Engineering. Thereafter UNRA engaged the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank as the transaction adviser for this project. The IFC then contracted IMC Worldwide and Vetiver Associates to provide preliminary assessment for the toll road\nFinancing for the Project\nIt was jointly funded by the government of Uganda and the Exim Bank of China. Of $476 m for the project, Uganda contributed only USD 126m and the remaining part of USD350m came from the pockets of China Exim Bank but given as a preferential buyer credit loan. The agreement was signed by GoU in May 2011. This loan is to be paid back in a period of 40 years by the government through collecting taxes from its citizens. More to be paid is the USD 40m used for compensation to the landowners who were vacated from areas where the expressway passed. What are the Benefits of this toll road? The main aim of this world-class carriageway was to ease traffic congestion on main roads in Kampala city and its suburbs. Uganda’s road traffic is growing at an estimated rate of 4.5 per cent per year. This is due to the increased number of vehicles in Kampala and other cities. This path will also reduce the travel time from Kampala to Entebbe or vice versor. It takes about 30 minutes. This is time-saving when compared to 120 minutes for someone who is using the old Kampala – Entebbe road.\n\nMr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I apologise and, propose that this Question be answered on Thursday, so that I can communicate with the Minister for Medical Services. It appears that the sanctions are not working very well, but the Chairâs hands are tied in this case. I think there has to be some other radical way of dealing with it. The Question is deferred to tomorrow afternoon. Member for Manyatta, hon Kathuri! Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also apologise for getting to the House late. asked the Minister for Roads:- (a) why the shaping and murraming project on Kamuthatha-Ndatu Road in Embu West District has been abandoned; (b) to clarify whether the contractor has received any payment, and if so, how much; (c) what action has been taken against the contractor; and (d) when the contractor will be back on site and what was the expected date of completion of the project. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is the second time I am coming to this House to answer the same Question and the Member has not been in the House. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. The answer is good but there is a lot of âcheatingâ in it. Order! Order! Mr. Kathuri, you been in Parliament for about two years now. I withdraw the word âcheatingâ. The answer is misleading. Yes, that is fair. From the outset, it is important to let this House know that we have had a problem with that contractor. He is not on site, yet it is indicated that he is on site. In fact, he has not even paid the workers who were doing the shaping of the road. I would want the Assistant Minister to tell us the names of the contractors, their physical address and the directors, so that, at least, we can know who these people are and where to find them. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the hon. Member is contradicting himself. From the onset, he has said that the answer is good. Thereafter, he has said that it is misleading. So, I do not know which one to take, but for now, I will take the first part. The contractor is under the Roads 2000 Programme and he is covering a distance of 5.4 kilometres. The contract was awarded to Lawfords International Limited for a contract sum of Kshs6.6 million. The contract period was 120 days which is four months. The works should have been completed by 31st October, 2009. As I have indicated, we wrote a termination notice on 26th October, 2009, and we are waiting for that period to expire. The contractor has been unable to perform as per the works programme and hence we gave the termination notice. Lastly, the contractor has 28 days to reply to the notice issued. However, if there is no improvement on the performance of the project, we shall terminate it. The Ministry will consult with the donor because the Roads 2000 is a donor-funded programme to ensure that the remaining works are re-tendered. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, of late there have been numerous questions on roads. I want the Assistant Minister to clarify the other systems of communication hon. Members have, as representatives of the people, to find answers to these Questions so that we do not have numerous Questions on roads being brought before this House. This is because there are engineers on the ground. For example, money has been sent to the ground to do some roads all over the country but those works are not being done. I have in mind the Kogwai Box Culvert in Rangwe Constituency. What system has the Assistant Minister put in place to ensure that we get answers at the regional level so that we do not congest this House with Questions on roads now and then? Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we do not mind the numerous Questions. However, as the hon. Member may have seen in last yearâs Budget, we are trying to devolve the roads funds from this financial year. We will be sending money directly to the constituencies and hon. Members will not come here to ask us Questions. Instead, it will be the other way round. We will disband the district roads committees and come up with the constituency roads committees where the hon. Members will sit. Therefore, it will be upon hon. Members to ensure that the works are, indeed, done.\n\nUganda has signed a Ush500 billion ($134 million) deal with a Chinese company to design and construct a section of its planned oil roads. The 97km road is part of a total 700km package to be constructed before oil starts flowing by 2022. The critical oil roads have been packaged into six, with two of the packages yet to receive a contractor. According to the Uganda National Roads Authority (Unra), the contractor—China Railway Seventh Group—under a pre-financing arrangement is expected to temporally meet the construction costs for a period of one year until the government secures funding. The authority, however, didn’t mention from where the government expects to secure the funds. During the contract signing in Kampala, Unra executive director Allen Kagina noted that at least 30 per cent of the works had been reserved for local contractors. In December 2016, the Cabinet directed Unra to have the roads in place to facilitate the transportation of construction materials by oil companies. Oil companies have previously complained that the bulk of the heavy machinery needed to construct oil wells is yet to be shipped into the country because it cannot be moved on existing roads. The companies said the machines are heavy that need good roads. Faced with this problem and time to beat, the authority is considering an option of having particular parts of the roads made motorable. “The contractor is called on to fast-track the work by beginning at two end points and also with bottlenecks like bridges, swamps, sharp corners so that the road is open to traffic even when the construction is incomplete,” said Mr Kagina. The authority however, is exercising caution on some of these roads since they pass through delicate ecosystems, such as Budongo forest, Murchison Falls National P ark and numerous swamps all of which need much environmental attention during construction. As a requirement of the three-year contract, Unra is expected to hand over the road site to the contractor who commences works in May this year when at least 30 per cent of the right of way has been secured to enable smooth movement. Land acquisition for major government projects in Uganda has been a problem, mostly over compensation disputes, which last year prompted Cabinet to suggest a constitutional amendments that will allow for compulsory acquisition of land by the government for major projects. Uganda has of 6.5 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves with about 2.2 billion recoverable. While the clock to 2020 ticks, Uganda is still faced with a challenge of completing major infrastructural development that will facilitate the oil sector like roads, a pipeline and the Kabaale international airport in Hoima district.\n\nIn addition, I want to indicate that this is going to be seed money on the progression of that construction. A contract for a detailed engineering design of Machakos-Masii Road has already been awarded after which construction of the said section will begin. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Question was here in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 and we have a similar answer and promises! Could the Minister confirm when the actual construction work is going to start? Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I expect the detailed engineering design to be completed by March this year. Meanwhile, I have placed a contractor on the road---\nIs it by the end of March or “by March” because we are already in March? Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, you are right. Before the end of this month, I should be having the detailed engineering design for the road. Meanwhile, I have placed a contractor to do maintenance on that road as I speak. Maintenance is ongoing as I speak. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Minister also shed some light even on other roads like the Mwatate-Taveta Road? Order! Order! Hon. Mwadeghu, take the trouble of doing a little bit of work and filing your own Questions. Do not hijack somebody else’s Question. On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The same Minister has been coming here and telling us year after year that the Taveta-Mwatate Road will be done and they are doing nothing. That is why I have taken this opportunity. I know he is in a position to shed some light. Could you, please, indulge my request with a lot of humility and humbleness? Minister, as a policy, you can proceed and answer; on policy matters, basically, on roads which you have given undertakings. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am impressed by the way the Member has put his question. I am also aware that he is interrogating the same through his Committee. We are into the final end of discussions with the African Development Bank which is going to fund us to do the road from Mwatate to Taveta. We expect to sign contracts before the end of the year. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are quite a number of such projects in the country. In fact, you repair here and after sometime when you come back, you find\nMr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will not shy away from it. I want to indicate to the hon. Member that I will be on that road on a date I will mention to him next week. I will go to inspect the Luanda-Majengo Road. We are seeking to increase our staff levels in the regions, so that we have a team that will be monitoring the conditions of our road. There are some specific roads which are giving us problems, and which were supposed to be handled by the 10 per cent which we have now spread equally to every constituency. But we are now trying to find ways and means of sorting out problems on those roads. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, first, I would like to congratulate the Minister because he seems to be aware of what is happening on the roads generally. I want him to also tell us what is happening to the Garissa-Modogashe Road. Initially, he had told us about the BADEA funding and, up to now, we have not heard anything going on. He should tell us what is going on. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, yes, the hon. Member is right. I am sure the Deputy Speaker is also alive to the matter. We have had fruitful discussions with the various development partners - mainly BADEA - and those other countries where BADEA is involved. I dispatched a team a month and a half ago to do the final signing of the agreements with the development partners. I am insisting that we must conclude this matter before the end of this financial year, so that we may be able, in the next financial year, to place our own contribution for the construction of that road. You realize that the Chair cannot ask supplementary questions from where it is. But are you sure the issue has to do with those other donors and not the Kenyan component? Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will not dispute your view. I realized the problem was in my own Ministry and that is why I dispatched the Permanent Secretary to go to Saudi Arabia to follow up the matter as quickly as we could. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the Minister has got this one wrong. I can see that the Minister has enough determination to work in almost all the parts of the country, apart from that region. You have not visited that site.\n\nWhile it is still unclear how the roads will intersect (like either a round-about or an overpass), there is presently a lot of work happening in that area! There will always be changes as development occurs, so we will adapt to a new way of doing things when the time comes. Will continue to keep you posted with more updates as they happen. End of the current phase of the project... This church and other residence will be\ndemolished to connect this road through Kajjansi. |Posted on October 26, 2015 at 4:30 AM|\nWhen the Entebbe Express Highway was constructed through Kawali (which will be the next blog post), the cliffs of Kawali became a rock quarry. These rocks are free ($$) for the taking. I have spent some time watching these workers, and it never fails to astound me! Rocks are hand harvested and loaded. Men can be found with a rudimentary instrument similar to a crow bar to pry these large boulders from the cliffs. Several men then hoist these stones into the back of trucks and take them away for whatever job. Some people (mainly women or elderly men) have set up small work stations at the rock quarry. They use homemade hammer-like tools to smash stones into smaller bits which they can sell. |Posted on October 24, 2015 at 5:30 AM|\nAs I previously mentioned, Kawali is the location of a fresh water spring that trickles into a small stream. It is one of the few free ($$) water sources in our area. Some houses have piped water (like mine) through the water company, so other community members can pay residence for usage of their outside water faucet. However, most residence use the Kawali water source. So early in the morning and in evening before dark dozens of people make the pilgrimage with their plastic jerrycans to fill water for their household (washing, bathing, cleaning, cooking). Incidentally, if a problem occurs with SMK’s bore hole (water pump), the children walk to this stream in Kawali for their water. One of the challenges with an open community water source is people also use it for other purposes. Cows drink from this source. People collect water to wash their clothes. People wash their boda-boda motorcycles or bicycles. People even use it for bathing. So it is definitely not clean water… but it is what is available. Kawali spring water in middle... boda motorcycle being washed, while others are washing clothes\n|Posted on October 21, 2015 at 2:50 AM|\nKawali (pronounced kah-wall-ee) is a small valley area within a short distance from SMK. It is the location of the area’s fresh spring water source (more on that in the next blog post), and until recently a natural landscape untouched by development. Several months ago, the new Entebbe Expressway cut almost directly down the middle of Kawali. (Update in upcoming blog post.) Depending on the mud-level, I often take my morning walk through Kawali where the only sounds are the chirping of various birds and buzz of insects. The walk provides an interesting commune with nature, livestock (goats and cows), and occasional sprinkling of people. Kawali reminds me of a large pasture with primitive, rutted, narrow walking paths cut out due to traffic of people, animals, and boda-boda motorcycles. Unfortunately, it is also littered with garbage along the paths, as people use this unmonitored area as a dumping ground. During my first couple walks through Kawali, I paid little attention to the overgrown bushes, shrubs, and grasses that blanket the area. But one day, my eyes were pleasantly opened by the hidden beauties living within this area. Flowers of various colors and sizes (although mostly very small) popped out at me, causing me to see this area in a whole new light. To a more knowledgeable eye I have learned that much of this greenery, blossoms, and fruits can be used for medicinal purposes. While I don’t possess that talent, I can appreciate its beauty, and I hope you do too! |Posted on October 4, 2015 at 2:50 AM|\nEven after 5 years, I still have NO desire to drive here in Uganda. Without any complaints, I board small Toyota Hiace taxi vans that transport millions of Ugandans daily.\n\nUganda's Kapchorwa – Suam Road Project for completion February 2022\nTarmacking of the Kapchorwa – Suam Road in Uganda linking Kapchorwa District in Uganda to the Kenyan border is on track for completion early this year 2022, following earlier delays. The 73km stretch of road connecting Kapchorwa, the district capital of Kapchorwa District to Suam, which lies on the Uganda-Kenya border, is currently being tarmacked. The project is set for completion by mid-February 2022. The project started in August 2018 with a groundbreaking ceremony performed by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Kenyan Vice-President Williams Ruto. With President Yoweri Museveni during the launch of the Kapchorwa-Suam Road at Kapchorwa, Uganda. pic.twitter.com\/DPdJb2zxBI— William Samoei Ruto, PhD (@WilliamsRuto) August 19, 2018\nThe road construction works is being carried out by China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC). The Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) is the supervising agency for the project. UNRA is the Uganda government agency responsible for developing and maintaining the country's national roads network, advising the government on general roads policy, and addressing national transport concerns. The dedication to timely and meticulous construction of this project was emphasized in a meeting on December 10, 2021, between Eng. Samuel Muhoozi, the Director for Roads and Bridges Development at UNRA, and China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) officials in Kapchorwa. Legislators from the Uganda Parliament’s Physical Infrastructure Committee were also present at this meeting. The scope of works for the Kapchorwa – Suam road construction project includes the tarmacking of the entire gravel road starting at Kapchorwa, moving west to Kween, then towards Bukwo and ending at Suam which is on the border of Kenya and Uganda. It also includes the construction of 20km town roads, 10-foot bridges, one border post, 11 high standard bridges, 23 box culverts and 191 pipe culverts. The cost of this road is estimated to be Ksh10.5 billion (US$105.76 million). The project was originally scheduled to be completed within 36 months, with a targeted completion date of 30 September 2021. However, the project faced delays due to extensive rock excavations which were more than what was anticipated, and abnormal rains. The delays have created a strain on the project funding, which is being provided by African Development Bank and African Development Fund. Advantages of the Project\nOn completion, the road will cut the travel time between Kapchorwa and Suam from 4 hours to one and a half hours. It is poised to improve farmers' prospects to market their produce far and wide. It will also provide a boost in trade between Uganda and Kenya.

This is a case of a contractor who has failed to perform. Could the Assistant Minister tell us the criterion that was used to award this contractor the contract given the fact that he does not appear to have the capacity? This is a countrywide problem. I think the problem lies with the roads engineers on the ground who enrich themselves instead of doing the roads. What has the Assistant Minister done to ensure that the contractors who are awarded contracts perform? Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I appreciate the question from the hon. Member and I think it is, indeed, a big problem in the country. We want to empower the local contractors because as soon as we award them contracts, they are unable to perform. I remember we have had Questions here where the Ministry has been accused of favouring foreign contractors. However, the issue of quality and timely delivery of service is extremely critical. My Ministry is currently undertaking a programme to build capacity for the local contractors in terms of finance and technical capacity. We believe that we will expand our capacity at the local level through this exercise. To conclude, I would also like to say that some contractors are not honest and as soon as they are paid the first installment, they go to other projects that are not related to the contract we have awarded them. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while we appreciate the answer given by the Assistant Minister, the occurrence of Question, on non-performance by contractors is worrying. I would like to give an example of the road between Muranga and Sagana which has been on-going for more than five years and the contractor has not completed it. Order, Mr. Mwangi! The Question is on Kamuthatha- Ndatu Road in Embu West District. You cannot ask a Question about a road in Muranga and expect the Assistant Minister to give you an answer when he has come prepared to answer a Question on a road in Embu. If you have a general policy question that you want to ask, ask it! Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister inform this House what the Government has done with the contracts who are non-performers but still get contractors to build roads? Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I agree with the hon. Member that we have a serious problem with contractors who bid for works, give very impressive records and then we meet in court once we have awarded them the contracts. This trend is, indeed, worrying because a lot of public money is wasted through such court cases. However, we have tightened the noose. We have made the qualification and pre- qualification for contractors more rigorous to ensure that those who get the contract will perform. In addition, we have included the performance bids and the bid bonds to ensure that those who do not comply with the terms of the contract are penalised. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, although the Assistant Minister has indicated that the Ministry has considered terminating the contract awarded to that contractor, what action will the Ministry take against the Resident Engineer who has allowed the present circumstances to prevail? Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Resident Engineer is the representative of the Ministry with regard to the contract. In a situation where we have a problem, we get early warning signals from the Resident Engineer in terms of the problems that exist. Therefore, the problem cannot be with that engineer. The Resident Engineer raised the red flag early enough and we have communicated with the contractor who, many at times does not comply. So, I would like to state clearly that the resident engineers are not the problem but the contractors. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Lawfords Contractor who appears to be a cowboy contractor also appears to be awarded many contracts by the Ministry. The works that he has already done on the road have deteriorated due to the delays. This definitely means a loss to him. Could the Ministry assure the residents of that area that the contractor will complete the road and not abandon it on grounds of insufficient funds? We want a guarantee that, that road will be completed with the money that has been allocated. Could the Assistant Minister confirm that the contractor will complete the road? What will the Assistant Minister do if the contractor does not complete the road? Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have indicated that that is the Government of Kenya (GoK) and donor-funded project.\n\nI want him to give us a definite date, not on maintenance, but when the construction is going to start. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as soon as I receive the detailed engineering designs at the end of this month, I should issue instructions for it to be tendered with money which I have already indicated of Kshs135 million. So, that is it! On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Minister in order to give promises in this House that he does not keep? I remember that he almost took it personally with me because there was an issue last year where he promised to do 4.5 kilometers which was abandoned by a contractor called Kabuitu. He said that he was going to make sure that it was done. That was last year in July but, up to date, nothing has been done. When I asked him, he took it personally and I am getting problems from that area. He is now telling Mr. C. Kilonzo the same and yet, I do not know whether he is going to keep that promise. He is getting commended for what he has done but, on keeping promises, I will give him four out of ten on a marking scale. Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for that question. I am aware of the promise and I want to tell the House that I am pursuing whatever promise I have made. One month ago, I recalled all the answers I have made in this House so that I could be told what we had done as promised in those answers. One of the roads which were discussed is what the hon. Member is discussing. So, I am already taking action. Let us not give Parliament false promises. This is an issue which is now very hot in my Ministry because I want things done right. I will take this opportunity to thank the hon. Members for the complements. I also want to complement them for the manner in which they have used the Constituency Roads Committee (CRC) money. I want to urge them to check because to date we have released Kshs13 million to the constituencies. So, I want hon. Members to check with their CRC committees on whether the money has been received and when it is received, I urge them to be critical in their prioritization and also in procuring the relevant contractors in those areas. This is one of the few Ministers who get away with a lot of complements but nonetheless let us go back to the final Question No.1185. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I apologise for coming in late. asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Local Government:- (a) what he intends to do about the study carried out in 1992\/93 by his Ministry towards the implementation of the Vihiga Water and Sewerage Scheme; and, (b) when he plans to commence the construction of the project. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. (a) It is true that my Ministry did a study on Vihiga Water and Sewerage Scheme in 1992 and 1993. Considering that this study was conducted 19 years ago and the report was not implemented due to various constraints including lack of financial resources and the long period that has lapsed, the study needs to be reviewed and updated in order to put into consideration the current needs and future development of the town. (b) The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and Ministry of Local Government no longer undertakes the water and sewerage projects as was the case when the study under reference was undertaken. The mandate of the project now lies with Amatsi Water Company and I have directed them to carry out a study of the scheme with a view of implementing the project. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the Assistant Minister for the answer. However, how much money was spent on the study since that time? If the consultants were paid how much were they paid? In part “b” of his answer where he has asked Amatsi Water Company to carry out the study, do they want to use the same study that was done at that time or do they want to carry out the study afresh? Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not have the figures of the amount that was used to conduct the study in 1992 and 1993 but I am sure that I can provide them to the hon. Member of Parliament even outside this forum. Secondly, Amatsi Water Company that has been mandated to carry out this will use an updated version of the report. So, the first thing they will do is to carry out the survey. Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.\n\n### Question: What are the key details about the contract for rehabilitating the Entebbe-Kibuye road section in Uganda?","passages":[{"passage":"Construction of Entebbe-Kibuye road in Uganda 50% complete\nThe 22 kilometres road section between Entebbe and Kibuye is being rehabilitated by Chinese contractor, China Communications Construction Company (CCCC). Entebbe Road leads to Uganda’s only international airport, and is one of the country’s busiest roads. The road links Wakiso District to Kibuye in Kampala to Mpala, Entebbe - passing through Kibuye, Kajjansi, and Abayita Ababiri before ending at the airport, a total distance of about 40 kilometres. Before the opening of the Entebbe–Kampala Expressway, the Entebbe road was the only direct link between Kampala and the international airport. The road is a single carriageway, and is narrow and congested with a heavy volume of traffic on the road. Because of the congestion, it is one of the most accident-prone roads in the country. Traffic on this road had reduced substantially after the completion of the Kampala-Entebbe Expressway in 2018, as many motorists resorted to using the expressway as an alternative route to avoid traffic congestion on the existing Kampala-Entebbe road. However, traffic on the road has since increased following the government implementation of toll payments on the Kampala-Entebbe Expressway in January this year (2022). Experience the impeccable road stretch away from the hustle of the city, as you drive past magnificent nature with fresh air kicking in across every bend. Experience the Kampala- Entebbe Expressway in all its glory. #KEEUG #ExploreUganda pic.twitter.com\/Sub1dt5NuL— Kampala Entebbe Expressway (@KEE_UG) March 29, 2022\nLast year, the Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) awarded a contract for the rehabilitation of a 22 kilometres stretch of the Entebbe road from Mpala, Entebbe in Wakiso District to Kibuye in Kampala. UNRA is the Ugandan government agency responsible for developing and maintaining the country's national roads network and advise the government on general road policies and national transport concerns. The contract for the rehabilitation of the 22 kilometre road stretch from Entebbe to Kibuye was awarded to the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), at a cost of US$12 million. The scope of the rehabilitation works includes the restoration of existing sidewalks, the construction of drainage channels to avoid flooding, in particular around the Kajjansi region, and the installation of street lights. Construction works commenced on the rehabilitation of the road sometime in August \/ September 2021. At the end of March this year (2022), the CCCC site engineer on the project, Mr Guo Zitong, stated that the project was 50% complete and would be completed within five months, i.e. in August this year (2022). This is according to a news article posted on the website of the Daily Monitor, a Ugandan newspaper. The Daily Monitor article also reported that the UNRA media relations manager, Mr Allan Ssempebwa, said that the road rehabilitation works in the section between Mpala and Kisubi in Wakiso district included stone pitching of side drains to aid the adequate flow of stormwater, shoulder repair, major full road width repairs, and installation of access culverts as well as access road construction to reduce silt damage on main pavements. Ssempebwa further explained that “Particular attention will be given to some sections, especially those prone to floodings, such as Lubowa, Zzana and Namasuba. For instance, the Bata-Bata area will be fixed with proper drainage systems”. Also speaking on the Entebbe-Kibuye road rehabilitation, Mr Francis Ojok, speaking on behalf of the officer in charge of Traffic in the Kajjansi area, emphasized the importance of the roadworks to free up traffic issues in the area. The introduction of pedestrian walkways will also help reduce the number of traffic accidents.

This is the first-ever toll road in the country and was developed by the Uganda National Road Authority\nThe consultation for this billion project between the Government of Uganda and China began in 2009. It was meant to improve traffic conditions and mitigate the congestion on the bypass and the distributor roads in urban areas. Its routes and Design details\nThis infrastructure has two lanes in each direction and two road sections (36.94km long section and 12.68km long link road). The speed limit on this road ranges between 50km\/ -100km\/h. Its 36.94km long section is divided into two parts whereby the first 24.9km stretch of the sections starts at a point on the Kampala Northern Bypass and runs along the new route before ending at Abayita ababiri. The 12.04km section starts at the Interchange (Abayita ababiri) and winds along the existing Kampala-Entebbe road. 7.4km of it was widened and 4.64km upgraded to the latest standards. Apart from that, its 12.68km long roads originate from the highway at Kajjansi interchange and continue eastwards up to Munyonyo. Bridges and Interchanges on the Expressway\nAdding to the four interchanges at Kajjansi, Busega, Lweza and Mpala, this expressway features nineteen over-bridges and eighteen underpasses that provide access to other areas around. Besides that, three main toll plazas were built on the expressway at Mpala, Kajjansi and Busega. Mpala and Kajjansi toll plazas have five gates. The Busega toll plaza differs itself unique with six toll gates. Moreover, two suspension bridges that measure 200m and 500m by length were put up over the Lubiji swamp in Busega and Kyengera. Its highway includes a 75m long bridge at Kajjansi and the 1.45m long suspension bridge over Nambigirwa swamp. The 240 pillars that support Nambigirwa swamp have a lifespan of 100 years and were installed to a depth of 55m. The Main Contractors\nUNRA awarded the design-build contract to China Communication Construction Company in October 2010. Then in May 2012, Beijing Expressway Supervision was selected as the consulting engineer for the supervision of the design and construction of this road. The site project management, investigations and laboratory tests, and geotechnical survey services for the expressway were provided between January 2012 and 2013 by the Ugandan consulting firm Project Management and Engineering. Thereafter UNRA engaged the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank as the transaction adviser for this project. The IFC then contracted IMC Worldwide and Vetiver Associates to provide preliminary assessment for the toll road\nFinancing for the Project\nIt was jointly funded by the government of Uganda and the Exim Bank of China. Of $476 m for the project, Uganda contributed only USD 126m and the remaining part of USD350m came from the pockets of China Exim Bank but given as a preferential buyer credit loan. The agreement was signed by GoU in May 2011. This loan is to be paid back in a period of 40 years by the government through collecting taxes from its citizens. More to be paid is the USD 40m used for compensation to the landowners who were vacated from areas where the expressway passed. What are the Benefits of this toll road? The main aim of this world-class carriageway was to ease traffic congestion on main roads in Kampala city and its suburbs. Uganda’s road traffic is growing at an estimated rate of 4.5 per cent per year. This is due to the increased number of vehicles in Kampala and other cities. This path will also reduce the travel time from Kampala to Entebbe or vice versor. It takes about 30 minutes. This is time-saving when compared to 120 minutes for someone who is using the old Kampala – Entebbe road.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:3b66253e-2ea9-4432-b47a-e0fa41fb3aca>"]},{"passage":"Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I apologise and, propose that this Question be answered on Thursday, so that I can communicate with the Minister for Medical Services. It appears that the sanctions are not working very well, but the Chairâs hands are tied in this case. I think there has to be some other radical way of dealing with it. The Question is deferred to tomorrow afternoon. Member for Manyatta, hon Kathuri! Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also apologise for getting to the House late. asked the Minister for Roads:- (a) why the shaping and murraming project on Kamuthatha-Ndatu Road in Embu West District has been abandoned; (b) to clarify whether the contractor has received any payment, and if so, how much; (c) what action has been taken against the contractor; and (d) when the contractor will be back on site and what was the expected date of completion of the project. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is the second time I am coming to this House to answer the same Question and the Member has not been in the House. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. The answer is good but there is a lot of âcheatingâ in it. Order! Order! Mr. Kathuri, you been in Parliament for about two years now. I withdraw the word âcheatingâ. The answer is misleading. Yes, that is fair. From the outset, it is important to let this House know that we have had a problem with that contractor. He is not on site, yet it is indicated that he is on site. In fact, he has not even paid the workers who were doing the shaping of the road. I would want the Assistant Minister to tell us the names of the contractors, their physical address and the directors, so that, at least, we can know who these people are and where to find them. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the hon. Member is contradicting himself. From the onset, he has said that the answer is good. Thereafter, he has said that it is misleading. So, I do not know which one to take, but for now, I will take the first part. The contractor is under the Roads 2000 Programme and he is covering a distance of 5.4 kilometres. The contract was awarded to Lawfords International Limited for a contract sum of Kshs6.6 million. The contract period was 120 days which is four months. The works should have been completed by 31st October, 2009. As I have indicated, we wrote a termination notice on 26th October, 2009, and we are waiting for that period to expire. The contractor has been unable to perform as per the works programme and hence we gave the termination notice. Lastly, the contractor has 28 days to reply to the notice issued. However, if there is no improvement on the performance of the project, we shall terminate it. The Ministry will consult with the donor because the Roads 2000 is a donor-funded programme to ensure that the remaining works are re-tendered. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, of late there have been numerous questions on roads. I want the Assistant Minister to clarify the other systems of communication hon. Members have, as representatives of the people, to find answers to these Questions so that we do not have numerous Questions on roads being brought before this House. This is because there are engineers on the ground. For example, money has been sent to the ground to do some roads all over the country but those works are not being done. I have in mind the Kogwai Box Culvert in Rangwe Constituency. What system has the Assistant Minister put in place to ensure that we get answers at the regional level so that we do not congest this House with Questions on roads now and then? Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we do not mind the numerous Questions. However, as the hon. Member may have seen in last yearâs Budget, we are trying to devolve the roads funds from this financial year. We will be sending money directly to the constituencies and hon. Members will not come here to ask us Questions. Instead, it will be the other way round. We will disband the district roads committees and come up with the constituency roads committees where the hon. Members will sit. Therefore, it will be upon hon. Members to ensure that the works are, indeed, done.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:d8090e94-0f7a-4204-974d-bdc05c639c60>"]},{"passage":"Uganda has signed a Ush500 billion ($134 million) deal with a Chinese company to design and construct a section of its planned oil roads. The 97km road is part of a total 700km package to be constructed before oil starts flowing by 2022. The critical oil roads have been packaged into six, with two of the packages yet to receive a contractor. According to the Uganda National Roads Authority (Unra), the contractor—China Railway Seventh Group—under a pre-financing arrangement is expected to temporally meet the construction costs for a period of one year until the government secures funding. The authority, however, didn’t mention from where the government expects to secure the funds. During the contract signing in Kampala, Unra executive director Allen Kagina noted that at least 30 per cent of the works had been reserved for local contractors. In December 2016, the Cabinet directed Unra to have the roads in place to facilitate the transportation of construction materials by oil companies. Oil companies have previously complained that the bulk of the heavy machinery needed to construct oil wells is yet to be shipped into the country because it cannot be moved on existing roads. The companies said the machines are heavy that need good roads. Faced with this problem and time to beat, the authority is considering an option of having particular parts of the roads made motorable. “The contractor is called on to fast-track the work by beginning at two end points and also with bottlenecks like bridges, swamps, sharp corners so that the road is open to traffic even when the construction is incomplete,” said Mr Kagina. The authority however, is exercising caution on some of these roads since they pass through delicate ecosystems, such as Budongo forest, Murchison Falls National P ark and numerous swamps all of which need much environmental attention during construction. As a requirement of the three-year contract, Unra is expected to hand over the road site to the contractor who commences works in May this year when at least 30 per cent of the right of way has been secured to enable smooth movement. Land acquisition for major government projects in Uganda has been a problem, mostly over compensation disputes, which last year prompted Cabinet to suggest a constitutional amendments that will allow for compulsory acquisition of land by the government for major projects. Uganda has of 6.5 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves with about 2.2 billion recoverable. While the clock to 2020 ticks, Uganda is still faced with a challenge of completing major infrastructural development that will facilitate the oil sector like roads, a pipeline and the Kabaale international airport in Hoima district.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:e72a2831-82ab-4e50-9736-bb94c91209cb>"]},{"passage":"In addition, I want to indicate that this is going to be seed money on the progression of that construction.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I expect the detailed engineering design to be completed by March this year. Meanwhile, I have placed a contractor on the road---\nIs it by the end of March or “by March” because we are already in March? Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, you are right. Before the end of this month, I should be having the detailed engineering design for the road. Meanwhile, I have placed a contractor to do maintenance on that road as I speak. Maintenance is ongoing as I speak. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Minister also shed some light even on other roads like the Mwatate-Taveta Road? Order! Order! Hon. Mwadeghu, take the trouble of doing a little bit of work and filing your own Questions. Do not hijack somebody else’s Question. On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The same Minister has been coming here and telling us year after year that the Taveta-Mwatate Road will be done and they are doing nothing. That is why I have taken this opportunity. I know he is in a position to shed some light. Could you, please, indulge my request with a lot of humility and humbleness? Minister, as a policy, you can proceed and answer; on policy matters, basically, on roads which you have given undertakings. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am impressed by the way the Member has put his question. I am also aware that he is interrogating the same through his Committee. We are into the final end of discussions with the African Development Bank which is going to fund us to do the road from Mwatate to Taveta. We expect to sign contracts before the end of the year.

Member that I will be on that road on a date I will mention to him next week. I will go to inspect the Luanda-Majengo Road. We are seeking to increase our staff levels in the regions, so that we have a team that will be monitoring the conditions of our road. There are some specific roads which are giving us problems, and which were supposed to be handled by the 10 per cent which we have now spread equally to every constituency. But we are now trying to find ways and means of sorting out problems on those roads. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, first, I would like to congratulate the Minister because he seems to be aware of what is happening on the roads generally. I want him to also tell us what is happening to the Garissa-Modogashe Road. Initially, he had told us about the BADEA funding and, up to now, we have not heard anything going on. He should tell us what is going on. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, yes, the hon. Member is right. I am sure the Deputy Speaker is also alive to the matter. We have had fruitful discussions with the various development partners - mainly BADEA - and those other countries where BADEA is involved. I dispatched a team a month and a half ago to do the final signing of the agreements with the development partners. I am insisting that we must conclude this matter before the end of this financial year, so that we may be able, in the next financial year, to place our own contribution for the construction of that road. You realize that the Chair cannot ask supplementary questions from where it is. But are you sure the issue has to do with those other donors and not the Kenyan component? Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will not dispute your view. I realized the problem was in my own Ministry and that is why I dispatched the Permanent Secretary to go to Saudi Arabia to follow up the matter as quickly as we could.

These rocks are free ($$) for the taking. I have spent some time watching these workers, and it never fails to astound me! Rocks are hand harvested and loaded. Men can be found with a rudimentary instrument similar to a crow bar to pry these large boulders from the cliffs. Several men then hoist these stones into the back of trucks and take them away for whatever job. Some people (mainly women or elderly men) have set up small work stations at the rock quarry. They use homemade hammer-like tools to smash stones into smaller bits which they can sell. |Posted on October 24, 2015 at 5:30 AM|\nAs I previously mentioned, Kawali is the location of a fresh water spring that trickles into a small stream. It is one of the few free ($$) water sources in our area. Some houses have piped water (like mine) through the water company, so other community members can pay residence for usage of their outside water faucet. However, most residence use the Kawali water source. So early in the morning and in evening before dark dozens of people make the pilgrimage with their plastic jerrycans to fill water for their household (washing, bathing, cleaning, cooking). Incidentally, if a problem occurs with SMK’s bore hole (water pump), the children walk to this stream in Kawali for their water. One of the challenges with an open community water source is people also use it for other purposes. Cows drink from this source. People collect water to wash their clothes. People wash their boda-boda motorcycles or bicycles. People even use it for bathing. So it is definitely not clean water… but it is what is available. Kawali spring water in middle... boda motorcycle being washed, while others are washing clothes\n|Posted on October 21, 2015 at 2:50 AM|\nKawali (pronounced kah-wall-ee) is a small valley area within a short distance from SMK. It is the location of the area’s fresh spring water source (more on that in the next blog post), and until recently a natural landscape untouched by development. Several months ago, the new Entebbe Expressway cut almost directly down the middle of Kawali. (Update in upcoming blog post.) Depending on the mud-level, I often take my morning walk through Kawali where the only sounds are the chirping of various birds and buzz of insects. The walk provides an interesting commune with nature, livestock (goats and cows), and occasional sprinkling of people. Kawali reminds me of a large pasture with primitive, rutted, narrow walking paths cut out due to traffic of people, animals, and boda-boda motorcycles. Unfortunately, it is also littered with garbage along the paths, as people use this unmonitored area as a dumping ground. During my first couple walks through Kawali, I paid little attention to the overgrown bushes, shrubs, and grasses that blanket the area. But one day, my eyes were pleasantly opened by the hidden beauties living within this area. Flowers of various colors and sizes (although mostly very small) popped out at me, causing me to see this area in a whole new light. To a more knowledgeable eye I have learned that much of this greenery, blossoms, and fruits can be used for medicinal purposes. While I don’t possess that talent, I can appreciate its beauty, and I hope you do too! |Posted on October 4, 2015 at 2:50 AM|\nEven after 5 years, I still have NO desire to drive here in Uganda.

The 73km stretch of road connecting Kapchorwa, the district capital of Kapchorwa District to Suam, which lies on the Uganda-Kenya border, is currently being tarmacked. The project is set for completion by mid-February 2022.

The Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) is the supervising agency for the project. UNRA is the Uganda government agency responsible for developing and maintaining the country's national roads network, advising the government on general roads policy, and addressing national transport concerns. The dedication to timely and meticulous construction of this project was emphasized in a meeting on December 10, 2021, between Eng. Samuel Muhoozi, the Director for Roads and Bridges Development at UNRA, and China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) officials in Kapchorwa. Legislators from the Uganda Parliament’s Physical Infrastructure Committee were also present at this meeting. The scope of works for the Kapchorwa – Suam road construction project includes the tarmacking of the entire gravel road starting at Kapchorwa, moving west to Kween, then towards Bukwo and ending at Suam which is on the border of Kenya and Uganda. It also includes the construction of 20km town roads, 10-foot bridges, one border post, 11 high standard bridges, 23 box culverts and 191 pipe culverts. The cost of this road is estimated to be Ksh10.5 billion (US$105.76 million). The project was originally scheduled to be completed within 36 months, with a targeted completion date of 30 September 2021. However, the project faced delays due to extensive rock excavations which were more than what was anticipated, and abnormal rains. The delays have created a strain on the project funding, which is being provided by African Development Bank and African Development Fund.

This is a case of a contractor who has failed to perform. Could the Assistant Minister tell us the criterion that was used to award this contractor the contract given the fact that he does not appear to have the capacity? This is a countrywide problem. I think the problem lies with the roads engineers on the ground who enrich themselves instead of doing the roads. What has the Assistant Minister done to ensure that the contractors who are awarded contracts perform? Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I appreciate the question from the hon. Member and I think it is, indeed, a big problem in the country. We want to empower the local contractors because as soon as we award them contracts, they are unable to perform. I remember we have had Questions here where the Ministry has been accused of favouring foreign contractors. However, the issue of quality and timely delivery of service is extremely critical. My Ministry is currently undertaking a programme to build capacity for the local contractors in terms of finance and technical capacity. We believe that we will expand our capacity at the local level through this exercise. To conclude, I would also like to say that some contractors are not honest and as soon as they are paid the first installment, they go to other projects that are not related to the contract we have awarded them. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while we appreciate the answer given by the Assistant Minister, the occurrence of Question, on non-performance by contractors is worrying. I would like to give an example of the road between Muranga and Sagana which has been on-going for more than five years and the contractor has not completed it. Order, Mr. Mwangi! The Question is on Kamuthatha- Ndatu Road in Embu West District. You cannot ask a Question about a road in Muranga and expect the Assistant Minister to give you an answer when he has come prepared to answer a Question on a road in Embu. If you have a general policy question that you want to ask, ask it! Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister inform this House what the Government has done with the contracts who are non-performers but still get contractors to build roads? Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I agree with the hon. Member that we have a serious problem with contractors who bid for works, give very impressive records and then we meet in court once we have awarded them the contracts. This trend is, indeed, worrying because a lot of public money is wasted through such court cases. However, we have tightened the noose. We have made the qualification and pre- qualification for contractors more rigorous to ensure that those who get the contract will perform. In addition, we have included the performance bids and the bid bonds to ensure that those who do not comply with the terms of the contract are penalised. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, although the Assistant Minister has indicated that the Ministry has considered terminating the contract awarded to that contractor, what action will the Ministry take against the Resident Engineer who has allowed the present circumstances to prevail? Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Resident Engineer is the representative of the Ministry with regard to the contract. In a situation where we have a problem, we get early warning signals from the Resident Engineer in terms of the problems that exist. Therefore, the problem cannot be with that engineer. The Resident Engineer raised the red flag early enough and we have communicated with the contractor who, many at times does not comply. So, I would like to state clearly that the resident engineers are not the problem but the contractors. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Lawfords Contractor who appears to be a cowboy contractor also appears to be awarded many contracts by the Ministry. The works that he has already done on the road have deteriorated due to the delays. This definitely means a loss to him. Could the Ministry assure the residents of that area that the contractor will complete the road and not abandon it on grounds of insufficient funds? We want a guarantee that, that road will be completed with the money that has been allocated. Could the Assistant Minister confirm that the contractor will complete the road? What will the Assistant Minister do if the contractor does not complete the road? Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have indicated that that is the Government of Kenya (GoK) and donor-funded project.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:d8090e94-0f7a-4204-974d-bdc05c639c60>"]},{"passage":"I want him to give us a definite date, not on maintenance, but when the construction is going to start.

So, that is it! On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Minister in order to give promises in this House that he does not keep? I remember that he almost took it personally with me because there was an issue last year where he promised to do 4.5 kilometers which was abandoned by a contractor called Kabuitu. He said that he was going to make sure that it was done. That was last year in July but, up to date, nothing has been done. When I asked him, he took it personally and I am getting problems from that area. He is now telling Mr. C. Kilonzo the same and yet, I do not know whether he is going to keep that promise. He is getting commended for what he has done but, on keeping promises, I will give him four out of ten on a marking scale. Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for that question. I am aware of the promise and I want to tell the House that I am pursuing whatever promise I have made. One month ago, I recalled all the answers I have made in this House so that I could be told what we had done as promised in those answers. One of the roads which were discussed is what the hon. Member is discussing. So, I am already taking action. Let us not give Parliament false promises. This is an issue which is now very hot in my Ministry because I want things done right. I will take this opportunity to thank the hon. Members for the complements. I also want to complement them for the manner in which they have used the Constituency Roads Committee (CRC) money. I want to urge them to check because to date we have released Kshs13 million to the constituencies. So, I want hon. Members to check with their CRC committees on whether the money has been received and when it is received, I urge them to be critical in their prioritization and also in procuring the relevant contractors in those areas. This is one of the few Ministers who get away with a lot of complements but nonetheless let us go back to the final Question No.1185. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I apologise for coming in late. asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Local Government:- (a) what he intends to do about the study carried out in 1992\/93 by his Ministry towards the implementation of the Vihiga Water and Sewerage Scheme; and, (b) when he plans to commence the construction of the project. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. (a) It is true that my Ministry did a study on Vihiga Water and Sewerage Scheme in 1992 and 1993. Considering that this study was conducted 19 years ago and the report was not implemented due to various constraints including lack of financial resources and the long period that has lapsed, the study needs to be reviewed and updated in order to put into consideration the current needs and future development of the town. (b) The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and Ministry of Local Government no longer undertakes the water and sewerage projects as was the case when the study under reference was undertaken. The mandate of the project now lies with Amatsi Water Company and I have directed them to carry out a study of the scheme with a view of implementing the project. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the Assistant Minister for the answer. However, how much money was spent on the study since that time? If the consultants were paid how much were they paid? In part “b” of his answer where he has asked Amatsi Water Company to carry out the study, do they want to use the same study that was done at that time or do they want to carry out the study afresh? Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not have the figures of the amount that was used to conduct the study in 1992 and 1993 but I am sure that I can provide them to the hon. Member of Parliament even outside this forum. Secondly, Amatsi Water Company that has been mandated to carry out this will use an updated version of the report. So, the first thing they will do is to carry out the survey. Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:fd313d34-0e7e-43c0-99a8-a627be3ff833>"]}]}

A corporation is a business entity that is owned by its shareholder(s), who elect a board of directors to oversee the organization’s activities. The corporation is liable for the actions and finances of the business – the shareholders are not. Corporations can be for-profit, as businesses are, or not-for-profit, as charitable organizations typically are. Types of Corporations There are two major types of corporations as well: Subchapter C corporations, which are larger organizations owned by multiple shareholders, which can also be other businesses, and Subchapter S corporations, which are often (but not always) smaller businesses owned by an individual shareholder. Before creating a corporation, consider what you hope to gain from establishing this separate entity. The biggest advantages of having a corporation are: - As with some other types of businesses, corporations provide liability protection for its owners, who are called shareholders. - Companies hoping to raise money from investors will have an easier time as a corporation, which can sell ownership shares. - Corporate profits are taxed, but at a lower rate than the personal income tax rate individuals pay. - Potential employees may find working for a corporation, with the prospect of ownership benefits, to be more appealing than working for a privately-held company. - The corporation can offer a medical reimbursement plan, deducting the cost of providing insurance to employees while allowing employees to use the benefit tax-free. While corporations can certainly shield owners from liability, the downsides are sizeable and very costly: - C Corporations are complex and expensive to set up. - Once established, corporations spend significant sums of money to stay on top of changing business regulations and timely filing of paperwork. They are best for large organizations with many employees. - Corporations pay federal, state, and sometimes local taxes on profits, unlike LLCs. - The corporation pays taxes on dividends paid to shareholders, who then pay taxes on that income themselves. Forming a Corporation Corporations are often formed in the state in which the business operates, but it doesn’t have to be. Some corporations are formed in states thought to be pro-business, such as Delaware or Nevada, although that creates extra paperwork. You then need to register the corporation as a foreign entity in the state in which you are doing business, and pay taxes to that state. The next step is creating Articles of Incorporation, which are filed with the state in which you have registered the corporation. These include: - The name and physical address of the business. - A description of the business and its goods and services. - The name and address of the registered agent, or the person authorized to receive official notices. - A count of the number of shares issued and to whom. And then create by-laws, which are the rules of the corporation. They include, at a minimum: - How often the board of directors meets, and when. - Whether the business operates on a calendar or fiscal year. - How long board members can serve. - Rules for changing by-laws. By-laws can be amended as needed once the corporation is formed. If you expect at some point in the near future to take your company public through an initial public offering (IPO), a C corporation may make a lot of sense.","question_category":"first turn question; Natural","question_category_desc":"the initial question of a conversation, and therefore self-contained and understandable, without any other context.; phrased in the way people typically speak, reflecting everyday language use, without formal or artificial structure.","user_category":"Expert","user_category_desc":"A specialized user with deep understanding of the corpus.","question":"What are the key tax implications for corporations compared to other business structures?","gold":"Corporations face distinct tax implications: they pay federal, state, and sometimes local taxes on profits, unlike LLCs. Additionally, there's a double taxation situation where the corporation pays taxes on dividends paid to shareholders, and then shareholders must pay taxes on that income themselves. However, corporate profits are taxed at a lower rate than the personal income tax rate individuals pay.","answer":"Corporations, specifically C-corporations, have distinct tax implications compared to other business structures like sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S-corporations. Here are the key differences:\n\n1. Double Taxation: C-corporations are subject to double taxation. The corporation itself pays taxes on its profits, and then shareholders are taxed again on the dividends they receive from those profits. This is often referred to as \"double taxation.\"\n\n2. Corporate Tax Rate: C-corporations are taxed at a flat corporate tax rate, which is currently 21% for federal taxes (as of 2023). This rate is lower than the top individual income tax rate but can vary depending on the state in which the corporation is based.\n\n3. Pass-Through Taxation: Sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S-corporations are pass-through entities, meaning the business's income \"passes through\" to the owners' personal tax returns. The owners pay taxes on this income at their individual tax rates, which can be lower than the corporate tax rate, especially for high earners.\n\n4. Self-Employment Taxes: Owners of sole proprietorships and partnerships are subject to self-employment taxes, which include Social Security and Medicare taxes. These taxes are not applicable to C-corporations, although the corporation and its employees are subject to payroll taxes.\n\n5. Flexibility with Profits: C-corporations can retain their profits without immediate tax consequences, which can be beneficial for reinvestment in the business. However, this can lead to the accumulation of earnings and profits, which may be subject to a corporate alternative minimum tax.\n\n6. Limited Liability: C-corporations provide owners with limited liability, meaning personal assets are generally protected from business debts and liabilities. This is also true for LLCs and S-corporations, but sole proprietorships and general partnerships do not offer this protection.\n\n7. Transferability: Shares in a C-corporation can be easily transferred, allowing for easier entry and exit for investors. This is also true for LLCs and S-corporations, but the transferability of interests in partnerships can be more complex.\n\n8. Complexity and Costs: C-corporations are generally more complex to set up and maintain, with more formal requirements, meetings, and paperwork. This can lead to higher administrative costs compared to simpler business structures like sole proprietorships and partnerships.\n\nIn summary, while C-corporations offer certain advantages, such as limited liability and the ability to retain profits without immediate tax consequences, they also come with the burden of double taxation and potentially higher administrative costs. Other business structures have their own tax implications and benefits, so the choice of business structure should be based on a careful evaluation of the specific needs and circumstances of the business and its owners.","final_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant.\n\n### Context: Courses 2011 - 2012\nLAW T 501 Taxation Of Corporations and Shareholders\nThe primary emphasis is on corporation\/shareholder relationships.

All taxes, including business activity taxes, are “people taxes” and have an economic impact.3 min read\nBusiness taxation is important to understand. All taxes, including business activity taxes, are “people taxes” and have an economic impact. Since only people can pay taxes, the tax burden ultimately falls on various groups of people. Business taxes include corporate franchise tax, employment tax, excise tax, gross receipts tax, and value added tax, VAT. How Are Applicable Taxes Determined? All firms must pay certain taxes, including:\n- Sales tax\nThe type of business a person owns will determine additional taxes they may pay. For example, insurance, mining and petroleum extraction companies are required to pay additional taxes specifically related to their industries. It is not uncommon for firms to pay a fee for doing business in a particular jurisdiction. What Is a Value-Added Tax? A value-added tax, VAT, also referred to as a goods and service tax is a consumption tax that is placed or assessed incrementally. The amount is based on the increase in value of the good or service at each stage, from production to point of sale. It avoids the double taxation of a direct sales tax because the producer or distributor does not get burdened with the tax. The end consumer ultimately catches the full brunt of the tax. Choosing the Returns You Must File\nThere are several return types and the one you file depends on your business structure. Sole proprietors and any other business structure with a pass-through structure file Form 1040. A pass-through structure allows owners to report business and expenses as part of their personal tax return. If you operate as a C corporation you will submit a copy of the 1120 Form and S corporations will submit the 1120s Form. Both nonprofit organizations and general partnerships will use information returns. Nonprofit organizations will use the 990 Form and general partnerships will use 1065 Form. Business-related returns will vary and may include sales and usage tax, payroll taxes and other specific state and local taxes. Also, the Form 1040-ES will include the estimated tax payments. Again, the tax rates will vary depending on the business structure you operate under and the type of business you have. Sole proprietors will file their return and face normal federal income tax rates on any revenue they generate through their self-employment. These rates can go as high as 39.6% and as low as 10%. This is also applicable to any business owner with a pass-through business structure, such as S corporations and partnerships. Take note, this does not include the 15.3 self-employment tax you may be subject too, nor any state or local taxes. Do All Businesses Incur a Corporate Income Tax? It is most likely that you will incur a corporate income tax if you operate as a C corporation or an LLC. This is based on the amount your corporation earns and essentially, the more you earn the more you pay in taxes. Tax rates start at 15% and go up to as high as 39%. Depending on where you conduct your business, you may have state and local corporate taxes as well. Tax Advantages for Businesses\nA big advantage at tax time for business owners is the opportunity to deduct every single business-related expense. Of course, individuals do not get to write off near as many deductions. For example, as a business owner, you can deduct 50% of any business-related meals and entertainment. In addition, vehicle expenses, home office expenses are all eligible deductions if they are in some way related to your business. This means your deductions can range from paper clips to high-powered computer servers as long as you document and keep your receipts to prove your deductions at tax time. Responsibility to Pay Taxes\nConversely, being your own boss and having huge deductions also comes with having a huge amount of responsibility. You are required to make sure your local, state, and federal taxes are submitted and paid in a timely manner, along with withholding taxes from employee's wages. In addition, you are responsible for preparing and filing a W-2 form for each employee. On top of all the tax responsibilities, you must comply with federal and state business license laws as well. There are a great many advantages for business owners as long as owners are willing to adapt to the roles and responsibilities that come with a successful thriving business.

Why? Because it will affect operating efficiency, transferability, control, the way you report income, the taxes you pay and your personal liability. Our team of CPAs and business advisors can evaluate your unique business and determine which structure is best for you and avoid potentials problems. After determining the best entity for your business, it will be critical to operate within the guidelines of the specific type of business to avoid losing elections or piercing a corporate veil. Five Basic Business Structure Types Are Available\n- A hybrid type of legal structure that provides the limited liability features of a corporation and the tax efficiencies and operational flexibility of a partnership\n- The ‘owners’ are referred to as ‘members.’ Depending on the state, the members can consist of a single individual (one owner), two or more individuals. corporations or other LLCs\n- Unlike shareholders in a corporation. in most states LLCs are not taxed as a separate business entity. Instead, all profits and losses are “passed through’ the business to each member of the LLC. LLC members report profits and losses on their personal federal tax returns, just like the owners of a partnership would\n- To form an LLC, you must file the appropriate documents with your state, a process generally done through your Secretary of State’s office\n- The simplest legal structure for any business\n- The business is not legally separated from you — me owner. (By default, the legal business name is the same as your legal name)\n- Establishing a business name separate from your own is possible by creating a “doing business as\" (DBA) name. Most states require DBAs to be registered with the county clerk or Secretary of State\n- Owner can take cash withdrawals from the business at will\n- Owner required to make quarterly estimated tax payments\n- Establishing a sole proprietorship may be as simple as opening a bank account for the business\n- Some states and municipalities may require obtaining a license or permit\n- Like a sole proprietorship, a general partnership is not a legal entity separate from its owners\n- The difference between a sole proprietorship and partnership is that a sole proprietorship has only one owner and a partnership has two or more owners\n- Owners can take withdrawals and, if specified in the partnership, guaranteed payments\n- Owners pay taxes quarterly\n- Can be started through an oral agreement, though a written agreement is advisable (and required in some states)\n- Many states have legal provisions for limited liability partnerships (LLPs) that provide for some limitations on the liability of the owners and on points such as profit\/loss percentages; business decisions; addition and withdrawal of a partner and terms of operation\n- Some partnership allocation structures may subject you and your business to heightened Internal Revenue Service (IRS) scrutiny\n- To form a partnership. you must register your business with your state, a process generally done through your Secretary of State’s ofﬁce\n- A separate legal entity from its owners\n- Corporate documents are filed with the state and an annual fee is paid\n- Separate corporate bank accounts and records are created, and assets and money generated by the corporation are owned by the corporation\n- Corporations are required to pay federal, state and, in some cases, local taxes\n- Most businesses must register with the IRS and state and local revenue agencies. Although any business that has employees will need to get a tax ID number, it is required for a corporation\n- Unlike sole proprietors and partnerships, corporations pay income tax on their profits. In some cases, corporations are taxed twice — first, when the company makes a profit, and again when dividends are paid to shareholders on their personal tax returns\n- Shareholders who also are employees pay income tax on their wages. The corporation and the employee each pay one half of the Social Security and Medicare taxes. but this usually is a deductible business expense for the corporation\n- To form a corporation, you must file articles of incorporation with you state, a process generally done through your Secretary of State’s office\n- A corporation with the Subchapter S designation from the IRS\n- To be considered an S corp, you must first charter a business as a corporation in the state where it is headquartered\n- An S corp is different from a C corp in that its profits and losses can pass though to the owner’s personal tax return. Consequently, the business is not taxed itself. Only the shareholders are taxed.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of businesses in the U.S. are not C-corporations subject to the corporate tax. Rather, most businesses—about 95 percent—are “pass-throughs,” which have their income “pass through” to their owners to be taxed under the individual income tax. Pass-through businesses include sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S-corporations. Because these businesses’ decisions are affected by both corporate and individual tax systems, earn a majority of U.S. business income, range in size and complexity, and operate economy-wide in a variety of industries, they represent unusual challenges to tax reform. Both the Trump administration and the 2016 House Republican tax reform plan propose large reductions in taxes paid on business income, including taxes paid by owners of pass-through businesses. For instance, the Trump tax plan proposes reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent and the top tax rate on income earned from pass-through business from 39.6 percent to 15 percent. To help understand the policy considerations surrounding the taxation of pass-through businesses and the implications of potential reforms, here are nine facts about pass-throughs and the current U.S. approach to taxing business. Click on each fact to jump to its discussion. - Most businesses are pass-throughs. Of the 26 million businesses in 2014, 95 percent were pass-throughs, while only 5 percent were C-corporations. - Almost all businesses are small. In 2014, almost 99 percent of businesses, whether pass-through businesses or C-corporations, had $10 million or less in sales or receipts. - Pass-throughs are not necessarily small businesses. A small number of large businesses account for the majority of pass-through profits and economic activity. - Pass through businesses now earn a majority of business income. In the early 1980s, C-corporations produced almost all business income. In 2013, only 44 percent of the income of business owners was earned through C-corporations. - Pass-through businesses pay lower tax rates than C-corporations. The gap between the lower tax rate on pass-throughs and the higher rates faced by C-corporations creates a major incentive for businesses to un-incorporate and to organize as pass-throughs. - The multitude of business types encourages inefficient tax avoidance. With so many options to choose from when determining how to structure a business and whether to distribute business income as profits, wages, or capital gains, business owners have considerable incentive and ability to avoid tax. - The growth of pass-through businesses has eroded corporate and payroll revenues. If the relative shares of pass-through and C-corporate activity were held at 1980 levels, the average tax rate on business income in 2011 would have produced at least $100 billion in additional revenue in 2011 alone. - Pass-through income is primarily earned by high-income individuals. About 70 percent of partnership income accrues to the top 1 percent, compared to less than 50 percent of corporate dividends and 11 percent of wages. - Pass-through businesses are responsible for a significant share of the tax gap. About 41 percent of the tax gap from 2008-2010, or $190 billion, was due to pass-throughs underreporting income and thus paying too little income tax. Fact 1: Most businesses are pass-throughs. Of the 26 million businesses in 2014, 95 percent were pass-throughs, while only 5 percent were C-corporations (Figure 1).1 C-corporations, which include most publicly traded businesses, pay taxes at the corporate level. As a result, the income of C-corporations is potentially taxed twice: once at the corporate level (with a top tax rate of 35 percent) and again when the profits are distributed to shareholders via dividends or capital gains (at rates up to 23.8 percent). Organizing as a C-corporation affords the owner limited liability (that is, the owner’s personal assets are protected against business losses) and facilitates complex financing such as selling shares to the public. In contrast, “pass-throughs” do not pay the corporate tax. Instead, their profits are “passed through” to their owners’ individual tax returns and taxed at the individual rate. - Sole proprietorships are the most common type of pass-through business and represented 43 percent of pass-throughs and 41 percent of all businesses. These companies are operated by a single taxpayer in a wide range of businesses, ranging from babysitters and housekeepers, ride-sharing drivers, construction or handyman services, and even some doctors and lawyers.\n\nBusiness Taxation Details\nBusiness Taxation might be both a personal and professional tax matter.

All income ought to be reported to the IRS. Bills are determined on the basis of non-public bills. This consists of objects similar to dwelling and automobile bills. An individual or company might deduct sure personal expenses from their gross income. Certain bills are itemized deductions. Underneath business taxation, private bills can be deducted. Other bills which are deductible include property taxes, insurance coverage premiums, license charges, finance prices, postage, postage stamps, etc. Since these bills might be deducted, this could significantly scale back your tax legal responsibility.

This sort of tax liability is referred to as the “customary” personal tax legal responsibility. A person may also be assessed tax liability based mostly on their earnings as a sole proprietor, a companion, a member of a partnership, an S-company, or an LLC. Finally, http:\/\/kscripts.com\/?s=business+tax+tips may be assessed customary personal tax duty as a C-corporation, a restricted legal responsibility company, or a partnership.

Whenever you start a business, you will have to select one organizational type from out of all the different business structures. This choice determines how your business will be set up and organized. In most instances, you will probably have to choose between a limited liability company (LLC), a partnership, a corporation, or a sole proprietorship. There are some criteria that you can use to find the business structure that works the best for your purpose. These criteria are:\nThe general rule for this category is that the more dangerous or risky the activity that your business will engage in, the less personal liability you want to have. Both corporations and LLCs allow business owners a type of \"limited liability,\" where anyone seeking claims against the business will have a very hard time placing personal liability on you as the owner. Conversely, if you were to organize your business as a partnership or a sole proprietorship, you could be personally responsible for anything the business did wrong. Expenses and Procedures\nIn general, there is no special paperwork that needs to be filed in order to establish either of these business structures. In addition, there are rarely any fees associated with establishing or maintaining either of these business structures. LLCs and corporations, on the other hand, are almost always more difficult and expensive to establish and maintain. In order to establish a corporation or limited liability company, you must file \"Articles of Incorporation\" with your secretary of state and pay fees associated with the incorporation. The details of the articles of incorporation and the amount of the fee will vary depending upon the state where you set up your business. In addition, when deciding to form a corporation or LLC, the owners of the business must decide which officers to elect to run the company. LLCs and corporations must keep specific and detailed records of any important business decisions, and follow many other formalities that are associated with these business structures. The easiest way to think about the different income tax structures that these business structures will use is to break them into two categories -- one comprised of those business structures where the business owners pay taxes on business profits, and one that includes all business structures where the business owners do not pay taxes on business profits. The first category includes sole proprietorships, partnerships and LLCs. These business structures are often referred to as \"pass-through\" tax entities because the taxes on the business profits and losses pass through to the business owners on their personal income taxes. Business owners of sole proprietorships, partnerships and LLCs must report and pay taxes on all net profits from their business, even if they take no money out of the business' account during the tax year. Unlike the pass through tax businesses, the owners of a corporation do not pay taxes on the net business profits of the corporation. Instead, the business owners of a corporation pay taxes only on the profits they actually take from the corporation in the form of salaries, dividends and bonuses. Because a corporation is a separate tax entity, it must pay taxes on any profits that remain within the company during a tax year, and also on any profits that it pays out in the form of dividends to shareholders. There is a tax benefit to forming your business as a corporation. The owners of a corporation do not pay taxes on any profits that the corporation keeps, and the corporation pays taxes at a lower rate than do some individuals. Structuring a business as a corporation allows a business to sell shares of ownership in the business through stock offerings. This is different than the other three business structures, which do not allow the selling of part of the business through the sale of stocks. Because of this investment scheme, it may allow owners of a corporation to attract investors and retain employees more easily by offering stock. If you never plan on having your business go on sale to the public, however, and don't need the investment incentives to retain employees, you probably do not need to go through the added procedure and cost of forming a corporation. If you desire the limited personal liability that comes from a corporation, you could instead form your business as a LLC. An LLC provides many of the advantages of a corporation while remaining more flexible.

Operating requirements for a multi-member S corporation are also significantly more complex than they are for an LLC. An S corporation must adopt bylaws which meet IRS guidelines and must have a corporate governing body that includes a board of directors and officers. How Taxes Affect S Corps and LLCs\nMost Americans pay a FICA tax of 7.65% of their income under $132,900, encompassing contributions to both Social Security and Medicare. Their employer pays the same 7.65% on their behalf. The self-employed, however, pay both sides of this tax, creating what’s known as the “self-employment tax.” This combines the aforementioned rates to the tune of a 15.3% tax on all self-employment income beneath the $132,900 limit. The self-employment tax applies to all pass-through income as well. It does not apply to corporate profit distributions, though. The profit distributions will likely be taxed as ordinary income, while you may be able to classify them at the lower dividend income rate. In the end, you will not pay any payroll taxes on them. S corporation members do not pay self-employment taxes on their profit distributions either. As a result, these members usually try to minimize the income portion of their earnings in favor of profit distributions. This is entirely valid as long as your income remains within a reasonable range. If you attempt to reduce your income too much, you will likely trigger an audit. Continuing our previous example, Sue’s LLC earned $100,000 and spent $10,000 in business expenses last year. Under the S corporation form, Sue would save herself more than $2,000 in payroll taxes. Here’s how things would shake out:\n- Sole Proprietorship – Sue will claim the $100,000 of income and the $10,000 of expenses herself. This will lead to her having $90,000 of taxable income. She will pay the 15.3% self-employment tax on all of it, leading to $13,770 in self-employment taxes. - S Corporation – Sue takes a salary of $75,000. Her LLC will pay $10,000 in expenses and send her $15,000 as a corporate profit distribution. Sue and her LLC will pay the full combined 15.3% tax on her salary earnings, coming to $11,475. She will pay no payroll taxes on her profit distribution. In most cases, if you do business as an individual or a partnership, you should consider forming an LLC. This corporate form is inexpensive and highly flexible. Unless you anticipate major growth involving external shareholders and outside investment in the future, an LLC is a good way to protect your personal assets. For an individual operator, the choice to elect S corporation tax status is largely a matter of accounting. If you would save a meaningful amount of money in self-employment taxes, it is likely worth electing S corporation status. For a partnership, consider the operating requirements of an S corporation carefully. Would it significantly affect your business to adhere to bylaws and corporate governance? Do you have few enough members, and will you likely keep that membership group small? If so, once again, consider whether an S corporation would create enough tax savings to justify the costs of filing and paperwork.

The net income of sole proprietors is subject both to individual income tax and also to payroll taxes under the Self Employment Contributions Act (SECA). - Partnerships are the second most numerous type of pass-through business. Partnerships file an entity-level tax return, but the income of the partnership is distributed to individual partners in proportions specified by their partnership agreement. In addition to being owned by U.S. taxpayers, partnerships may be owned by a wide variety of businesses, individuals, non-profits, or other partnerships. Additionally, limited liability companies (LLCs) can elect to be taxed as partnerships. Because of the tax benefits and legal advantages offered by partnership law, partnerships are now used to organize a substantial share of finance, real estate, and investment management activities.2 While general partners are subject to SECA on their business income, limited partners are subject to SECA only on certain payments, and the application of SECA taxes to members of many limited liability companies (LLCs) is unclear.3\n- S-corporations file a corporate tax return and are generally subject to the same legal protections as C-corporations, but their income is passed-through pro-rata to its shareholders. In contrast to C-corporations or partnerships, the number of S-corporation shareholders is limited, there may only be one class of stock, and shareholders must generally be U.S. individuals (i.e. not tax-exempt organizations or retirement accounts, other corporations, or partnerships). S-corporation income is not subject to SECA, but owners who provide services to the corporation are required to pay themselves “reasonable compensation” in wages, which are subject to payroll taxes. While they are not “pass-throughs,” many closely-held C corporations in which the owners are also managers share certain similarities with pass-throughs and, in practice, the income of their owners is often taxed much like that of sole proprietors. Owner\/managers of closely-held C corporations often pay themselves wages, which are deductible from corporate-level tax, in lieu of dividends, which are not. This way, they maintain the limited liability and legal benefits of incorporation, but avoid the two levels of corporate tax by receiving their income as wages. As a result, the taxes they face are more similar to general partners or sole proprietors than to, say, publicly-traded C corporations. Fact 2: Almost all businesses are small. The vast majority of U.S. businesses are small, whether they are pass-through businesses or C-corporations. Figure 2 shows the share of businesses with $10 million in receipts by type of business. Receipts generally mean sales, but can include income from legal services, rent received, or portfolio income of a financial firm. In 2014, almost 99 percent of all businesses were “small” by this standard (Figure 2).4 Almost every sole proprietorship was a small business; but 95 percent of C-Corporations were small as well. Whether a business is a pass-through partnership or an S-corporation, or whether it is a C-corporation is not a good indicator for the size, complexity, or even number of shareholders of a business. Fact 3: Pass-through businesses are not necessarily small businesses. While most businesses are small, the majority of economic activity occurs in large businesses—including large pass-throughs. In 2014, almost 83 percent of all sales and 81 percent of profits accrued to businesses with more than $10 million in total receipts, even though those businesses only represented 1 percent of all firms (Figure 2, Figure 3).5 Large businesses are responsible for nearly all of the sales and profits of C-Corporations, and a substantial majority of sales and profits of partnerships and S-corporations. Among sole proprietorships, in contrast, only 9 percent of sales and less than 1 percent of profits came from large businesses. Most hedge funds, private equity funds, law, consulting, and accounting firms are partnerships; these businesses can be large, global enterprises. Indeed, in 2014, about a quarter of partnership business income was earned in finance, real estate, and holding companies sectors, and about 13 percent by law firms.\n\nA Peek into Corporate Taxation\nIt’s that time of the year again. Birds are fluttering their wings and colorful flowers are blooming everywhere. That’s right. It’s summer! And what better way to refresh yourself than buying an ice-cold bottle of your favorite beer. Once you step foot in the supermarket, you realize prices have drastically increased because of an increase in demand. You think to yourself: “Well if I had a beer company, I know what I’d do! I would make prices as low as possible for people to chug on their beers as much as they want!”\nPretty easy solution if you’re a consumer and not a corporation. You see, if you were to run a corporation, you’d have to think about YOUR profits and expenses first. Plus, you’d have to deal with impending corporate taxes. What Is Corporate Tax? Corporate tax is levied by the government on corporations. After expenses are deducted, the government imposes an income tax. However, corporations don’t pay their taxes via bank accounts like consumers. Instead, they pay their dues through several routes. Read on to find out who bears the burden of a corporate tax. Who Pays for Corporate Tax? If you’ve seen the VAT on many of your daily purchases, you’ll realize that a lot of these taxes are collected through consumers. Let’s say the price of your beer bottle= 20$ x VAT (45%) = 29$\nThat VAT which equals 45% is the tax imposed on the beer company. · Lowering employee wages and letting workers pay the price is another way corporations seek to cover their taxes. · The owners and shareholders might also take the hit through earning lower dividends and decreasing profits. Gain Advantage from Corporate Tax\nDid you know there are different tax structures you can implement for your business? If you choose to operate as a corporation, you will gain the following advantages:\n– Medical insurance for families that can be fully tax-deductible. – Retirement plans can be set up as fringe benefits which can also be deductible. – Expanding your business through keeping your profits in the company. This can be accomplished by opting for corporation income tax instead of individual income tax. On the contrary, if you choose to be a sole proprietor, keep in mind that you will be fully liable for any debts incurred. Also, your profits can take a huge plunge if you don’t manage your finances correctly. Pro tip: Consult a professional before jumping the gun and making a regrettable decision. Automation in Corporate Tax\nCorporations might not feel the need to use automation in their low-volume tasks, as these can be done manually. However, when it comes to privacy issues, automation can protect against breaches in data. No doubt, cloud software that helps in streamlining and securing your transactions is a sure solution. This software allows multiple people to connect at the same time, offers efficient bookkeeping processes while also making sure all data is fully encrypted. The Importance of Professional Help\nDreaming about your business being prosperous is one of the best feelings ever. However, that haunting feeling of figuring out your taxes can mess with your felicity. For this reason, reaching out to companies that are competent and budget-friendly in corporate tax accounting is a must to manage your accounts payables, your cash flows, and financial statements easily and forget about tax nightmares!\n\n### Question: What are the key tax implications for corporations compared to other business structures?","passages":[{"passage":"Courses 2011 - 2012\nLAW T 501 Taxation Of Corporations and Shareholders\nThe primary emphasis is on corporation\/shareholder relationships.

All taxes, including business activity taxes, are “people taxes” and have an economic impact.3 min read\nBusiness taxation is important to understand. All taxes, including business activity taxes, are “people taxes” and have an economic impact. Since only people can pay taxes, the tax burden ultimately falls on various groups of people. Business taxes include corporate franchise tax, employment tax, excise tax, gross receipts tax, and value added tax, VAT. How Are Applicable Taxes Determined? All firms must pay certain taxes, including:\n- Sales tax\nThe type of business a person owns will determine additional taxes they may pay. For example, insurance, mining and petroleum extraction companies are required to pay additional taxes specifically related to their industries. It is not uncommon for firms to pay a fee for doing business in a particular jurisdiction. What Is a Value-Added Tax? A value-added tax, VAT, also referred to as a goods and service tax is a consumption tax that is placed or assessed incrementally. The amount is based on the increase in value of the good or service at each stage, from production to point of sale. It avoids the double taxation of a direct sales tax because the producer or distributor does not get burdened with the tax. The end consumer ultimately catches the full brunt of the tax. Choosing the Returns You Must File\nThere are several return types and the one you file depends on your business structure. Sole proprietors and any other business structure with a pass-through structure file Form 1040. A pass-through structure allows owners to report business and expenses as part of their personal tax return. If you operate as a C corporation you will submit a copy of the 1120 Form and S corporations will submit the 1120s Form. Both nonprofit organizations and general partnerships will use information returns. Nonprofit organizations will use the 990 Form and general partnerships will use 1065 Form. Business-related returns will vary and may include sales and usage tax, payroll taxes and other specific state and local taxes. Also, the Form 1040-ES will include the estimated tax payments. Again, the tax rates will vary depending on the business structure you operate under and the type of business you have. Sole proprietors will file their return and face normal federal income tax rates on any revenue they generate through their self-employment. These rates can go as high as 39.6% and as low as 10%. This is also applicable to any business owner with a pass-through business structure, such as S corporations and partnerships. Take note, this does not include the 15.3 self-employment tax you may be subject too, nor any state or local taxes. Do All Businesses Incur a Corporate Income Tax? It is most likely that you will incur a corporate income tax if you operate as a C corporation or an LLC. This is based on the amount your corporation earns and essentially, the more you earn the more you pay in taxes. Tax rates start at 15% and go up to as high as 39%. Depending on where you conduct your business, you may have state and local corporate taxes as well. Tax Advantages for Businesses\nA big advantage at tax time for business owners is the opportunity to deduct every single business-related expense. Of course, individuals do not get to write off near as many deductions. For example, as a business owner, you can deduct 50% of any business-related meals and entertainment. In addition, vehicle expenses, home office expenses are all eligible deductions if they are in some way related to your business. This means your deductions can range from paper clips to high-powered computer servers as long as you document and keep your receipts to prove your deductions at tax time. Responsibility to Pay Taxes\nConversely, being your own boss and having huge deductions also comes with having a huge amount of responsibility. You are required to make sure your local, state, and federal taxes are submitted and paid in a timely manner, along with withholding taxes from employee's wages. In addition, you are responsible for preparing and filing a W-2 form for each employee. On top of all the tax responsibilities, you must comply with federal and state business license laws as well. There are a great many advantages for business owners as long as owners are willing to adapt to the roles and responsibilities that come with a successful thriving business.

Five Basic Business Structure Types Are Available\n- A hybrid type of legal structure that provides the limited liability features of a corporation and the tax efficiencies and operational flexibility of a partnership\n- The ‘owners’ are referred to as ‘members.’ Depending on the state, the members can consist of a single individual (one owner), two or more individuals. corporations or other LLCs\n- Unlike shareholders in a corporation. in most states LLCs are not taxed as a separate business entity. Instead, all profits and losses are “passed through’ the business to each member of the LLC. LLC members report profits and losses on their personal federal tax returns, just like the owners of a partnership would\n- To form an LLC, you must file the appropriate documents with your state, a process generally done through your Secretary of State’s office\n- The simplest legal structure for any business\n- The business is not legally separated from you — me owner. (By default, the legal business name is the same as your legal name)\n- Establishing a business name separate from your own is possible by creating a “doing business as\" (DBA) name. Most states require DBAs to be registered with the county clerk or Secretary of State\n- Owner can take cash withdrawals from the business at will\n- Owner required to make quarterly estimated tax payments\n- Establishing a sole proprietorship may be as simple as opening a bank account for the business\n- Some states and municipalities may require obtaining a license or permit\n- Like a sole proprietorship, a general partnership is not a legal entity separate from its owners\n- The difference between a sole proprietorship and partnership is that a sole proprietorship has only one owner and a partnership has two or more owners\n- Owners can take withdrawals and, if specified in the partnership, guaranteed payments\n- Owners pay taxes quarterly\n- Can be started through an oral agreement, though a written agreement is advisable (and required in some states)\n- Many states have legal provisions for limited liability partnerships (LLPs) that provide for some limitations on the liability of the owners and on points such as profit\/loss percentages; business decisions; addition and withdrawal of a partner and terms of operation\n- Some partnership allocation structures may subject you and your business to heightened Internal Revenue Service (IRS) scrutiny\n- To form a partnership. you must register your business with your state, a process generally done through your Secretary of State’s ofﬁce\n- A separate legal entity from its owners\n- Corporate documents are filed with the state and an annual fee is paid\n- Separate corporate bank accounts and records are created, and assets and money generated by the corporation are owned by the corporation\n- Corporations are required to pay federal, state and, in some cases, local taxes\n- Most businesses must register with the IRS and state and local revenue agencies. Although any business that has employees will need to get a tax ID number, it is required for a corporation\n- Unlike sole proprietors and partnerships, corporations pay income tax on their profits. In some cases, corporations are taxed twice — first, when the company makes a profit, and again when dividends are paid to shareholders on their personal tax returns\n- Shareholders who also are employees pay income tax on their wages. The corporation and the employee each pay one half of the Social Security and Medicare taxes. but this usually is a deductible business expense for the corporation\n- To form a corporation, you must file articles of incorporation with you state, a process generally done through your Secretary of State’s office\n- A corporation with the Subchapter S designation from the IRS\n- To be considered an S corp, you must first charter a business as a corporation in the state where it is headquartered\n- An S corp is different from a C corp in that its profits and losses can pass though to the owner’s personal tax return.

Only the shareholders are taxed.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:fb6cc359-66e6-4fef-b255-694f181f9487>"]},{"passage":"The overwhelming majority of businesses in the U.S. are not C-corporations subject to the corporate tax. Rather, most businesses—about 95 percent—are “pass-throughs,” which have their income “pass through” to their owners to be taxed under the individual income tax. Pass-through businesses include sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S-corporations. Because these businesses’ decisions are affected by both corporate and individual tax systems, earn a majority of U.S. business income, range in size and complexity, and operate economy-wide in a variety of industries, they represent unusual challenges to tax reform. Both the Trump administration and the 2016 House Republican tax reform plan propose large reductions in taxes paid on business income, including taxes paid by owners of pass-through businesses. For instance, the Trump tax plan proposes reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent and the top tax rate on income earned from pass-through business from 39.6 percent to 15 percent. To help understand the policy considerations surrounding the taxation of pass-through businesses and the implications of potential reforms, here are nine facts about pass-throughs and the current U.S. approach to taxing business. Click on each fact to jump to its discussion. - Most businesses are pass-throughs. Of the 26 million businesses in 2014, 95 percent were pass-throughs, while only 5 percent were C-corporations. - Almost all businesses are small. In 2014, almost 99 percent of businesses, whether pass-through businesses or C-corporations, had $10 million or less in sales or receipts. - Pass-throughs are not necessarily small businesses. A small number of large businesses account for the majority of pass-through profits and economic activity. - Pass through businesses now earn a majority of business income. In the early 1980s, C-corporations produced almost all business income. In 2013, only 44 percent of the income of business owners was earned through C-corporations. - Pass-through businesses pay lower tax rates than C-corporations. The gap between the lower tax rate on pass-throughs and the higher rates faced by C-corporations creates a major incentive for businesses to un-incorporate and to organize as pass-throughs. - The multitude of business types encourages inefficient tax avoidance. With so many options to choose from when determining how to structure a business and whether to distribute business income as profits, wages, or capital gains, business owners have considerable incentive and ability to avoid tax. - The growth of pass-through businesses has eroded corporate and payroll revenues. If the relative shares of pass-through and C-corporate activity were held at 1980 levels, the average tax rate on business income in 2011 would have produced at least $100 billion in additional revenue in 2011 alone. - Pass-through income is primarily earned by high-income individuals. About 70 percent of partnership income accrues to the top 1 percent, compared to less than 50 percent of corporate dividends and 11 percent of wages. - Pass-through businesses are responsible for a significant share of the tax gap. About 41 percent of the tax gap from 2008-2010, or $190 billion, was due to pass-throughs underreporting income and thus paying too little income tax. Fact 1: Most businesses are pass-throughs. Of the 26 million businesses in 2014, 95 percent were pass-throughs, while only 5 percent were C-corporations (Figure 1).1 C-corporations, which include most publicly traded businesses, pay taxes at the corporate level. As a result, the income of C-corporations is potentially taxed twice: once at the corporate level (with a top tax rate of 35 percent) and again when the profits are distributed to shareholders via dividends or capital gains (at rates up to 23.8 percent). Organizing as a C-corporation affords the owner limited liability (that is, the owner’s personal assets are protected against business losses) and facilitates complex financing such as selling shares to the public. In contrast, “pass-throughs” do not pay the corporate tax. Instead, their profits are “passed through” to their owners’ individual tax returns and taxed at the individual rate. - Sole proprietorships are the most common type of pass-through business and represented 43 percent of pass-throughs and 41 percent of all businesses. These companies are operated by a single taxpayer in a wide range of businesses, ranging from babysitters and housekeepers, ride-sharing drivers, construction or handyman services, and even some doctors and lawyers.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:0e013242-fa67-4f99-a801-28e82898cb2f>"]},{"passage":"Business Taxation Details\nBusiness Taxation might be both a personal and professional tax matter.

Whenever you start a business, you will have to select one organizational type from out of all the different business structures. This choice determines how your business will be set up and organized. In most instances, you will probably have to choose between a limited liability company (LLC), a partnership, a corporation, or a sole proprietorship. There are some criteria that you can use to find the business structure that works the best for your purpose. These criteria are:\nThe general rule for this category is that the more dangerous or risky the activity that your business will engage in, the less personal liability you want to have. Both corporations and LLCs allow business owners a type of \"limited liability,\" where anyone seeking claims against the business will have a very hard time placing personal liability on you as the owner. Conversely, if you were to organize your business as a partnership or a sole proprietorship, you could be personally responsible for anything the business did wrong. Expenses and Procedures\nIn general, there is no special paperwork that needs to be filed in order to establish either of these business structures. In addition, there are rarely any fees associated with establishing or maintaining either of these business structures. LLCs and corporations, on the other hand, are almost always more difficult and expensive to establish and maintain. In order to establish a corporation or limited liability company, you must file \"Articles of Incorporation\" with your secretary of state and pay fees associated with the incorporation. The details of the articles of incorporation and the amount of the fee will vary depending upon the state where you set up your business. In addition, when deciding to form a corporation or LLC, the owners of the business must decide which officers to elect to run the company. LLCs and corporations must keep specific and detailed records of any important business decisions, and follow many other formalities that are associated with these business structures. The easiest way to think about the different income tax structures that these business structures will use is to break them into two categories -- one comprised of those business structures where the business owners pay taxes on business profits, and one that includes all business structures where the business owners do not pay taxes on business profits. The first category includes sole proprietorships, partnerships and LLCs. These business structures are often referred to as \"pass-through\" tax entities because the taxes on the business profits and losses pass through to the business owners on their personal income taxes. Business owners of sole proprietorships, partnerships and LLCs must report and pay taxes on all net profits from their business, even if they take no money out of the business' account during the tax year. Unlike the pass through tax businesses, the owners of a corporation do not pay taxes on the net business profits of the corporation. Instead, the business owners of a corporation pay taxes only on the profits they actually take from the corporation in the form of salaries, dividends and bonuses. Because a corporation is a separate tax entity, it must pay taxes on any profits that remain within the company during a tax year, and also on any profits that it pays out in the form of dividends to shareholders. There is a tax benefit to forming your business as a corporation. The owners of a corporation do not pay taxes on any profits that the corporation keeps, and the corporation pays taxes at a lower rate than do some individuals. Structuring a business as a corporation allows a business to sell shares of ownership in the business through stock offerings. This is different than the other three business structures, which do not allow the selling of part of the business through the sale of stocks. Because of this investment scheme, it may allow owners of a corporation to attract investors and retain employees more easily by offering stock. If you never plan on having your business go on sale to the public, however, and don't need the investment incentives to retain employees, you probably do not need to go through the added procedure and cost of forming a corporation. If you desire the limited personal liability that comes from a corporation, you could instead form your business as a LLC. An LLC provides many of the advantages of a corporation while remaining more flexible.

Operating requirements for a multi-member S corporation are also significantly more complex than they are for an LLC. An S corporation must adopt bylaws which meet IRS guidelines and must have a corporate governing body that includes a board of directors and officers. How Taxes Affect S Corps and LLCs\nMost Americans pay a FICA tax of 7.65% of their income under $132,900, encompassing contributions to both Social Security and Medicare. Their employer pays the same 7.65% on their behalf. The self-employed, however, pay both sides of this tax, creating what’s known as the “self-employment tax.” This combines the aforementioned rates to the tune of a 15.3% tax on all self-employment income beneath the $132,900 limit. The self-employment tax applies to all pass-through income as well. It does not apply to corporate profit distributions, though. The profit distributions will likely be taxed as ordinary income, while you may be able to classify them at the lower dividend income rate. In the end, you will not pay any payroll taxes on them. S corporation members do not pay self-employment taxes on their profit distributions either. As a result, these members usually try to minimize the income portion of their earnings in favor of profit distributions. This is entirely valid as long as your income remains within a reasonable range. If you attempt to reduce your income too much, you will likely trigger an audit. Continuing our previous example, Sue’s LLC earned $100,000 and spent $10,000 in business expenses last year. Under the S corporation form, Sue would save herself more than $2,000 in payroll taxes. Here’s how things would shake out:\n- Sole Proprietorship – Sue will claim the $100,000 of income and the $10,000 of expenses herself. This will lead to her having $90,000 of taxable income. She will pay the 15.3% self-employment tax on all of it, leading to $13,770 in self-employment taxes. - S Corporation – Sue takes a salary of $75,000. Her LLC will pay $10,000 in expenses and send her $15,000 as a corporate profit distribution. Sue and her LLC will pay the full combined 15.3% tax on her salary earnings, coming to $11,475. She will pay no payroll taxes on her profit distribution. In most cases, if you do business as an individual or a partnership, you should consider forming an LLC. This corporate form is inexpensive and highly flexible. Unless you anticipate major growth involving external shareholders and outside investment in the future, an LLC is a good way to protect your personal assets. For an individual operator, the choice to elect S corporation tax status is largely a matter of accounting. If you would save a meaningful amount of money in self-employment taxes, it is likely worth electing S corporation status. For a partnership, consider the operating requirements of an S corporation carefully. Would it significantly affect your business to adhere to bylaws and corporate governance? Do you have few enough members, and will you likely keep that membership group small? If so, once again, consider whether an S corporation would create enough tax savings to justify the costs of filing and paperwork.

The net income of sole proprietors is subject both to individual income tax and also to payroll taxes under the Self Employment Contributions Act (SECA). - Partnerships are the second most numerous type of pass-through business. Partnerships file an entity-level tax return, but the income of the partnership is distributed to individual partners in proportions specified by their partnership agreement. In addition to being owned by U.S. taxpayers, partnerships may be owned by a wide variety of businesses, individuals, non-profits, or other partnerships. Additionally, limited liability companies (LLCs) can elect to be taxed as partnerships. Because of the tax benefits and legal advantages offered by partnership law, partnerships are now used to organize a substantial share of finance, real estate, and investment management activities.2 While general partners are subject to SECA on their business income, limited partners are subject to SECA only on certain payments, and the application of SECA taxes to members of many limited liability companies (LLCs) is unclear.3\n- S-corporations file a corporate tax return and are generally subject to the same legal protections as C-corporations, but their income is passed-through pro-rata to its shareholders. In contrast to C-corporations or partnerships, the number of S-corporation shareholders is limited, there may only be one class of stock, and shareholders must generally be U.S. individuals (i.e. not tax-exempt organizations or retirement accounts, other corporations, or partnerships). S-corporation income is not subject to SECA, but owners who provide services to the corporation are required to pay themselves “reasonable compensation” in wages, which are subject to payroll taxes. While they are not “pass-throughs,” many closely-held C corporations in which the owners are also managers share certain similarities with pass-throughs and, in practice, the income of their owners is often taxed much like that of sole proprietors. Owner\/managers of closely-held C corporations often pay themselves wages, which are deductible from corporate-level tax, in lieu of dividends, which are not. This way, they maintain the limited liability and legal benefits of incorporation, but avoid the two levels of corporate tax by receiving their income as wages. As a result, the taxes they face are more similar to general partners or sole proprietors than to, say, publicly-traded C corporations. Fact 2: Almost all businesses are small. The vast majority of U.S. businesses are small, whether they are pass-through businesses or C-corporations. Figure 2 shows the share of businesses with $10 million in receipts by type of business. Receipts generally mean sales, but can include income from legal services, rent received, or portfolio income of a financial firm. In 2014, almost 99 percent of all businesses were “small” by this standard (Figure 2).4 Almost every sole proprietorship was a small business; but 95 percent of C-Corporations were small as well. Whether a business is a pass-through partnership or an S-corporation, or whether it is a C-corporation is not a good indicator for the size, complexity, or even number of shareholders of a business. Fact 3: Pass-through businesses are not necessarily small businesses. While most businesses are small, the majority of economic activity occurs in large businesses—including large pass-throughs. In 2014, almost 83 percent of all sales and 81 percent of profits accrued to businesses with more than $10 million in total receipts, even though those businesses only represented 1 percent of all firms (Figure 2, Figure 3).5 Large businesses are responsible for nearly all of the sales and profits of C-Corporations, and a substantial majority of sales and profits of partnerships and S-corporations. Among sole proprietorships, in contrast, only 9 percent of sales and less than 1 percent of profits came from large businesses. Most hedge funds, private equity funds, law, consulting, and accounting firms are partnerships; these businesses can be large, global enterprises. Indeed, in 2014, about a quarter of partnership business income was earned in finance, real estate, and holding companies sectors, and about 13 percent by law firms.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:0e013242-fa67-4f99-a801-28e82898cb2f>"]},{"passage":"A Peek into Corporate Taxation\nIt’s that time of the year again. Birds are fluttering their wings and colorful flowers are blooming everywhere. That’s right. It’s summer! And what better way to refresh yourself than buying an ice-cold bottle of your favorite beer. Once you step foot in the supermarket, you realize prices have drastically increased because of an increase in demand. You think to yourself: “Well if I had a beer company, I know what I’d do! I would make prices as low as possible for people to chug on their beers as much as they want!”\nPretty easy solution if you’re a consumer and not a corporation. You see, if you were to run a corporation, you’d have to think about YOUR profits and expenses first. Plus, you’d have to deal with impending corporate taxes. What Is Corporate Tax? Corporate tax is levied by the government on corporations. After expenses are deducted, the government imposes an income tax. However, corporations don’t pay their taxes via bank accounts like consumers. Instead, they pay their dues through several routes. Read on to find out who bears the burden of a corporate tax. Who Pays for Corporate Tax? If you’ve seen the VAT on many of your daily purchases, you’ll realize that a lot of these taxes are collected through consumers. Let’s say the price of your beer bottle= 20$ x VAT (45%) = 29$\nThat VAT which equals 45% is the tax imposed on the beer company. · Lowering employee wages and letting workers pay the price is another way corporations seek to cover their taxes. · The owners and shareholders might also take the hit through earning lower dividends and decreasing profits. Gain Advantage from Corporate Tax\nDid you know there are different tax structures you can implement for your business? If you choose to operate as a corporation, you will gain the following advantages:\n– Medical insurance for families that can be fully tax-deductible. – Retirement plans can be set up as fringe benefits which can also be deductible. – Expanding your business through keeping your profits in the company. This can be accomplished by opting for corporation income tax instead of individual income tax. On the contrary, if you choose to be a sole proprietor, keep in mind that you will be fully liable for any debts incurred. Also, your profits can take a huge plunge if you don’t manage your finances correctly. Pro tip: Consult a professional before jumping the gun and making a regrettable decision. Automation in Corporate Tax\nCorporations might not feel the need to use automation in their low-volume tasks, as these can be done manually. However, when it comes to privacy issues, automation can protect against breaches in data. No doubt, cloud software that helps in streamlining and securing your transactions is a sure solution. This software allows multiple people to connect at the same time, offers efficient bookkeeping processes while also making sure all data is fully encrypted. The Importance of Professional Help\nDreaming about your business being prosperous is one of the best feelings ever. However, that haunting feeling of figuring out your taxes can mess with your felicity. For this reason, reaching out to companies that are competent and budget-friendly in corporate tax accounting is a must to manage your accounts payables, your cash flows, and financial statements easily and forget about tax nightmares!","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:62fb2e4f-6a1d-4858-aca2-ad34ca9c87b7>"]}]}

GUARANTEED ISSUE LIFE INSURANCE\nWith the tough economic times these days, it’s easy to think, “Maybe I don’t need a life insurance plan right now.” In reality, maybe you need one now more than ever before. Life Insurance in Today’s Economic Environment\nIf you’ve been putting off buying life insurance because of the cost, you may not realize that there’s an affordable alternative to expensive life insurance, (guaranteed issue life insurance). There’s no need to leave those who depend on you without protection. Guaranteed issue life insurance provides an affordable opportunity to give your family the financial security they need. Benefits of Guaranteed Issue Life Insurance:\n- The simplest and most affordable type of life insurance you can buy. Death benefits are tax-free to beneficiaries.

Simple to understand, simple to apply…no medical exam required! - Simplified underwriting…just answer 6-8 “yes \/ no” questions. Approval process takes 10 minutes!\n\nA big draw of critical illness insurance is that the money can be spent on a variety of things, such as:\nTo pay for critical medical services that might otherwise be unavailable\nTo pay for treatments not covered by a traditional policy\nTo pay for daily living expenses, enabling the critically ill to focus their time and energy on getting well instead of working to pay their bills\nTransportation expenses, such as getting to and from treatment centers, retrofitting vehicles to carry scooters or wheelchairs, and installing lifts in homes for critically ill patients who can no longer navigate staircases\nTerminally ill patients, or those simply in need of a restful place to recuperate, can use the funds to take a vacation with friends or family\nLow Cost, Limited Coverage\nPart of what makes these policies appealing is that they generally don’t cost much, especially when you get them through an employer. Some smaller plans run as little as $25 a month, which looks like a bargain compared to the cost of a typical, low-deductible health insurance policy. null\nSome healthcare experts are skeptical as to whether they really are a good deal for consumers. One overarching concern is that they’ll only reimburse you for a somewhat narrow range of illnesses. If the illness you’re diagnosed with doesn’t fit the definition of a covered illness, you’re out of luck. The more illnesses your plan covers, the more you’ll pay in premiums. A 45-year-old female with an individual, cancer-only plan may pay $40 a month for $25,000 of coverage. That same woman may pay twice that a month if she expanded the coverage to include coronary illnesses, organ transplants, and certain other conditions. Like all insurance policies, critical illness policies are also subject to a host of stipulations. Not only do they cover only the conditions listed in the policy, but they cover them only under the specific circumstances noted in the policy. A diagnosis of cancer, for example, may not be enough to trigger payment of the policy if the cancer has not spread beyond the initial point of discovery or is not life-threatening. A diagnosis of a stroke may not trigger a payment unless the neurological damage persists for more than 30 days. Other restrictions may include a specific number of days for which the policyholder must be ill or must survive after diagnosis.5\nSeniors should be particularly careful about these policies. There may be limits for payout on some policies, with persons over a certain age (such as 75) ineligible for payment, or they may include so-called “age reduction schedules,” which means your potential insurance payout shrinks as you get older. It is important to note that many of these policies do not provide a guaranteed payment. For example, a typical insurance company discloses that in its critical illness policy “the expected benefit ratio for this policy is 60%. This ratio is the portion of future premiums that the company expects to return as benefits when averaged over all people with this policy.” If 60% of the premiums are eventually paid out in claims, 40% of the premiums are never paid out at all. Alternatives to Critical Illness Insurance\nInsiders point out that there are alternative forms of coverage without all these restrictions. Disability insurance, for example, provides income when you can’t work for medical reasons, and financial protection isn’t limited to a narrow set of illnesses. This is an especially good option for anyone whose livelihood would take a significant hit from a prolonged work absence.6\nConsumers with a high-deductible plan can also make contributions to either a health savings account or flexible spending account (FSA), both of which offer tax benefits when used for qualified expenses.7\nYou can also build a separate savings account to cover nonmedical outlays that could arise if you have cancer, for example, and have taken leave from your job. How Do I Buy Critical Illness Insurance? Critical illness insurance is a policy that pays a direct lump-sum benefit that you can spend to pay for expenses not covered by other insurance. You can purchase it yourself or through your employer, or add it to your personal life insurance plan. What Does Critical Illness Insurance Provide for Assistance? Critical illness insurance can help fund the bills that life-threatening illnesses like heart attack, stroke, or cancer can incur.\n\nAs you may not know, according to the health figures from India, 3 percent of citizens became poor because of spending too much money on illnesses every year. In other words, due to the fact that too much money goes for treatments, 3 percent of population go down to one level under their current present class yearly. For instance, high class citizens will become middle and middle people become lower class. It is really bad if our finance is influenced too much by diseases as the possibility of being affected by threatening diseases is now higher on a daily basis. Thus, we had better take a proper solution into consideration. The society is getting modern now so that it has been changed in both good and bad ways. There is an increase in obesity people in India, which comes with diabetes as well as many heart diseases. Another factor influencing on our health is pollution, which has been proved that 7 percent of death in India is attributed to respiratory exposure. Prior to being affected by any diseases, it is better for people to be well prepared in terms of finance. As a result, having a critical illness insurance plan is considered to be the best option in this case. - The definition of critical illness insurance\nCritical illness cover is a type of insurance in which the insurance provider will make sure to cover a lump sum cash payment in case the policy holder is exposed to one of critical illness in the list of the insurance policy. Every critical illness plan will be made specific in terms of covered and uncovered illnesses. Such illnesses as heart diseases, cancer and coma are mostly covered by all the critical illness insurance plans. The operational cost for these kinds of illnesses may last for the whole life and the cover for other critical illnesses are different from various providers. You should remember that there are some illness types that are not covered by any critical illness policy. Therefore, you should be careful when choosing a critical illness insurance by reading the policy terms and conditions to see what illnesses are covered and not covered in the policy. - The advantages of critical illness policy\nFirst and foremost, the critical illness policy is a financial security for your beloved people. It means that this insurance product will protect your life while making sure that your family is secure in terms of finance. Secondly, there are more than 30 types of illnesses which are covered in this policy. However, some companies are now offering coverage for more than 30 illnesses. So before making decision to buy any policy, you should be sure what the diseases are covered. What is more, if you are diagnosed to a critical illness, the insurance vendor will pay the whole sum of money signed in the policy. Last but not least, critical illness insurance policy will bring about the peace of mind. When you have already had your critical illness policy, you will feel unworried as finance will not be your burden. When you are exposed to a disease, you can pay attention to the treatment instead of finding money. - What points to consider when getting a critical illness insurance plan\nThere are a lot of critical illness policies so it is not easy at all to choose the best policy one for you. The article will present some of the aspects for you to assess the suitable critical illness policy. First of all, it is the premium amount. You should make a comparison of premium amount for each critical illness policy to see what policy comes with the best value for money in terms of the illness cover you want. Secondly, sum assured from the insurance company is also an important factor. You had better know your financial life will not be influenced too much because of any unexpected illness. What is more, waiting period is the time in which the illnesses in the policy are not covered. For instance, if it is three months, so if there is a critical illness occurring to you before two months, your claim will not be taken. Insurance provider will evaluate your claim to decide the sum assured and paying this sum will take place only after purchasing a critical illness policy. Thus, before choosing a policy, you ought to be sure that the policy comes with lesser waiting period. Moving to the next point, it is the survival period, which is the time period during which the policy holder needs to survive after being exposed to the illness so that they can get a claim. The insurance cover will be paid only when the survival period has passed. Thus, if the policy holder dies instantly after suffering from a heart attack, his or her beloved ones can not get the payout from the insurance company even when he or she has already had a critical illness insurance. The survival period of various insurance companies is different, which can be two weeks or one month and so on. Hence, when choosing a critical illness plan, you should make sure the policy comes with the least survival period.\n\nNuestros agentes se especializan en seguros de gastos finales y pueden ayudarle a encontrar la póliza adecuada para usted que cubra sus necesidades. Consider yourself lucky you’ve probably never had to use critical illness insurance (sometimes called catastrophic illness insurance). Perhaps you’ve never even heard of it. But in the event of a big health emergency, such as cancer, a heart attack, or a stroke, critical illness insurance could be the only thing standing between you and financial ruin. Many people assume they’re fully protected with a standard health insurance plan, but the exorbitant costs of treating life-threatening illnesses are usually more than any plan will cover. Read on to learn more about critical illness insurance and whether it’s something you and your family should consider.null\nCritical illness insurance provides additional coverage for medical emergencies like heart attacks, strokes, or cancer. Because these emergencies or illnesses often incur greater-than-average medical costs, these policies pay out cash to help cover those overruns when traditional health insurance may fall short. These policies come at a relatively low cost. However, the instances that they will cover are generally limited to a few illnesses or emergencies. Critical Illness Insurance 101\nAs the average life expectancy in the United States continues to increase, insurance brokers are finding ways to make sure Americans can afford the privilege of getting older. Critical illness insurance was developed in 1996, as people realized that surviving a heart attack or stroke could leave a patient with insurmountable medical bills. “Even with excellent medical insurance, just one critical illness can be a tremendous financial burden,” says certified financial planner Jeff Rossi, director of talent development at Santander Bank in New York. Critical illness insurance provides a benefit if you experience one or more of the following medical emergencies:null\nBecause these illnesses require extensive medical care and treatment, their costs can outstrip a family’s medical insurance policy quickly. If you don’t have an emergency fund or health savings account (HSA), you’ll have an even harder time paying those bills out of pocket. Many people are now choosing high-deductible health plans, which can be something of a double-edged sword: Consumers benefit from relatively affordable monthly premiums but can find themselves in a real pinch if a serious illness strikes. Critical illness insurance can pay for costs not covered by traditional insurance. The money can also be used for nonmedical costs related to the illness, including transportation, child care, and so on. Typically, the insured will receive a lump sum to cover those costs. Coverage limits vary—you could be eligible for a few thousand dollars all the way up to $100,000, depending on your policy. Policy pricing is impacted by a number of factors, including the amount and extent of coverage, the sex, age, and health of the insured, and family medical history.2\nThere are exceptions to critical illness insurance coverage. Some types of cancer may not be covered, while chronic illnesses are also frequently exempted. You may not be able to receive a payout if a disease comes back or if you suffer a second stroke or heart attack. Some coverage might end when the insured reaches a certain age. So, like any form of insurance, make sure to read the policy carefully. The last thing you want to worry about is your emergency plan.3\nWhy It May Be Important\nYou can purchase critical illness insurance on your own or through your employer (many offer it as a voluntary benefit). You can also add it to your current life insurance plan as a rider, which may be a more affordable option with the same benefit.4\nOne of the reasons companies have been keen to add these plans is that they recognize employees are worried about steep out-of-pocket expenses with a high-deductible plan. Unlike other healthcare benefits, workers generally bear the entire cost of critical illness plans. That makes it a money saver for companies and workers alike.\n\nIs Critical Illness Cover Worth It?

Some smaller plans run as little as $25 a month, which looks like a bargain compared to the cost of a typical, low-deductible health insurance policy. null\nSome healthcare experts are skeptical as to whether they really are a good deal for consumers. One overarching concern is that they’ll only reimburse you for a somewhat narrow range of illnesses. If the illness you’re diagnosed with doesn’t fit the definition of a covered illness, you’re out of luck. The more illnesses your plan covers, the more you’ll pay in premiums. A 45-year-old female with an individual, cancer-only plan may pay $40 a month for $25,000 of coverage. That same woman may pay twice that a month if she expanded the coverage to include coronary illnesses, organ transplants, and certain other conditions. Like all insurance policies, critical illness policies are also subject to a host of stipulations. Not only do they cover only the conditions listed in the policy, but they cover them only under the specific circumstances noted in the policy. A diagnosis of cancer, for example, may not be enough to trigger payment of the policy if the cancer has not spread beyond the initial point of discovery or is not life-threatening. A diagnosis of a stroke may not trigger a payment unless the neurological damage persists for more than 30 days. Other restrictions may include a specific number of days for which the policyholder must be ill or must survive after diagnosis.5\nSeniors should be particularly careful about these policies. There may be limits for payout on some policies, with persons over a certain age (such as 75) ineligible for payment, or they may include so-called “age reduction schedules,” which means your potential insurance payout shrinks as you get older. It is important to note that many of these policies do not provide a guaranteed payment. For example, a typical insurance company discloses that in its critical illness policy “the expected benefit ratio for this policy is 60%. This ratio is the portion of future premiums that the company expects to return as benefits when averaged over all people with this policy.” If 60% of the premiums are eventually paid out in claims, 40% of the premiums are never paid out at all. Alternatives to Critical Illness Insurance\nInsiders point out that there are alternative forms of coverage without all these restrictions. Disability insurance, for example, provides income when you can’t work for medical reasons, and financial protection isn’t limited to a narrow set of illnesses. This is an especially good option for anyone whose livelihood would take a significant hit from a prolonged work absence.6\nConsumers with a high-deductible plan can also make contributions to either a health savings account or flexible spending account (FSA), both of which offer tax benefits when used for qualified expenses.7\nYou can also build a separate savings account to cover nonmedical outlays that could arise if you have cancer, for example, and have taken leave from your job. How Do I Buy Critical Illness Insurance? Critical illness insurance is a policy that pays a direct lump-sum benefit that you can spend to pay for expenses not covered by other insurance.

Last but not least, critical illness insurance policy will bring about the peace of mind. When you have already had your critical illness policy, you will feel unworried as finance will not be your burden. When you are exposed to a disease, you can pay attention to the treatment instead of finding money. - What points to consider when getting a critical illness insurance plan\nThere are a lot of critical illness policies so it is not easy at all to choose the best policy one for you. The article will present some of the aspects for you to assess the suitable critical illness policy. First of all, it is the premium amount. You should make a comparison of premium amount for each critical illness policy to see what policy comes with the best value for money in terms of the illness cover you want. Secondly, sum assured from the insurance company is also an important factor. You had better know your financial life will not be influenced too much because of any unexpected illness. What is more, waiting period is the time in which the illnesses in the policy are not covered. For instance, if it is three months, so if there is a critical illness occurring to you before two months, your claim will not be taken. Insurance provider will evaluate your claim to decide the sum assured and paying this sum will take place only after purchasing a critical illness policy. Thus, before choosing a policy, you ought to be sure that the policy comes with lesser waiting period. Moving to the next point, it is the survival period, which is the time period during which the policy holder needs to survive after being exposed to the illness so that they can get a claim. The insurance cover will be paid only when the survival period has passed. Thus, if the policy holder dies instantly after suffering from a heart attack, his or her beloved ones can not get the payout from the insurance company even when he or she has already had a critical illness insurance. The survival period of various insurance companies is different, which can be two weeks or one month and so on. Hence, when choosing a critical illness plan, you should make sure the policy comes with the least survival period.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:aed69efc-049c-44b4-b609-79a06a8385e4>"]},{"passage":"Nuestros agentes se especializan en seguros de gastos finales y pueden ayudarle a encontrar la póliza adecuada para usted que cubra sus necesidades.

These are some of the factors that will determine your premium:\n- whether or not you smoke, or have previously smoked in the last 12 months\n- your age\n- how much cover you want and how long you need it to last\n- your health and lifestyle, including your weight and family medical history\n- your job - some occupations are seen as higher risk and therefore can have higher premiums associated\nWhat's the difference between Life Insurance and Critical Illness Cover? The essential difference between Life Insurance and Critical Illness Cover is that the former provides financial protection in the event of your death during the length of your policy, while the latter covers you for the diagnosis of a specified critical illness. You might take out a Life Insurance policy and choose to add Critical Illness Cover for an extra cost. With Legal & General, you can not buy Critical Illness Cover as a standalone policy. Here are some of the differences between Life Insurance and Critical Illness Cover:\n- Control of funds – Life Insurance usually pays out to your loved ones, giving them control of how to use the money when a valid claim is made. With Critical Illness Cover, you would receive the pay out and can decide how best to use it. - The payout – life insurance is designed to pay out a cash sum in the event of your death and can help minimise the financial impact on your loved ones that are left behind. Whereas Critical Illness Cover is designed to pay out following the diagnosis of a specified critical illness, helping to alleviate some of the stress at a difficult time while you recover. - Children's Critical Illness Cover – this is included automatically with our Critical Illness Cover and offers some financial protection if your children become critically ill, which is not offered as part of our standard Life Insurance policy. Terms and conditions apply. You just need to remember that these policies are not savings and investment plans and have no cash value unless a valid claim is made. Our Critical Illness Cover\nSo, there are differences between Life and Critical Illness Cover, but both can help to protect you and your loved ones when you need it most.","doc_IDs":["<urn:uuid:4a59d100-72b1-493c-b48a-23711f92b5bc>"]}]}
