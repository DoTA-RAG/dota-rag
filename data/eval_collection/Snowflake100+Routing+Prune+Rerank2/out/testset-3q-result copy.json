    "gold": "A Polish pottery Unikat (Signature) piece is special because it is hand painted using both sponges and brushes, and it is signed by the artist who painted it. These pieces are considered the most involving works of art, with larger Unikat items requiring several hours of very careful work to complete.",
    "answer": "A Polish pottery piece is considered a \"Unikat\" (Signature) item when it has been hand-painted with both sponges and brushes and is signed by the artist who painted it. This signifies that it is a unique, one-of-a-kind work of art. Regular pieces, on the other hand, may be painted using molds or stencils, which can result in more uniform patterns across multiple pieces. Unikat pieces are the most intricate works of art and require hours of very careful work to finish, making them more valuable and sought after by collectors.",

While living in Europe for many years, Beach visited Poland in 1993 and became a collector of the brightly colored and patterned pieces. She began sending gifts home to her mother and sister-in-law, and after they fell in love as well, she began to wonder if there might be a market for Polish pottery. When she returned home to Florida in 1999, the Polish Pottery business was born. 100 DIFFERENT PATTERNS AND MORE THAN 200 UNIQUE SHAPES. The warehouse itself is a hidden gem, located in an industrial area along Wickham Road at 3185 New York Avenue #13, in Melbourne. But walking through the doors into the 4,000 square feet of retail space filled with color and pattern is an amazing experience. “I’ve heard it’s an adventure coming into the store. It can be a little overwhelming the first time you come in, with so many choices. I suggest taking a stroll through the entire store to get a better idea of what’s available.”\nBeach is happy to walk customers through the offerings and is a wealth of information about the history, artistry and utilitarianism of Polish pottery. “One great feature of Polish pottery is you can create your own unique collection by mixing and matching patterns, and the more you get, the easier it is to add another.”Each piece is hand painted in Poland, and the high firing temperatures create durable, utilitarian stoneware covered in intricate, beautiful decorations. All Polish pottery is oven, microwave and dishwasher safe, making it perfectly suited for everyday use. “It’s essentially functional art,” Beach said. “Some pieces are labeled UNIKAT, meaning ‘unique’ in Polish. Collectors are sure to find some unique pieces to add to their collection.”But for Beach, the things that make certain pieces special are the holiday and family memories wrapped up in her collection. “I have so many traditional pieces I’ve had in my house forever — casseroles and plates I served Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners on year after year.

My love for Polish pottery began with my own collection, which grew until I replaced most of my tableware with it. After receiving many compliments and buying a lot of pieces as gifts for friends and family, I decided to spread my love for Polish pottery and Groshek Pottery was born. Groshek (or groszek) means \"polka dot\" in Polish, which reflects the many beautiful spotty designs that Polish pottery is renowned for. What is Polish pottery? Every piece of Polish pottery is handmade and hand-decorated using stamps and brushes. It comes in hundreds of shapes, with patterns ranging from classic dots and “peacock eyes” to more intricate “artistic” or “UNIKAT” patterns. My pottery comes from Zaklady Ceramiczne “Boleslawiec”, which is one of the biggest manufacturers in the region and whose tradition goes back to the 19th century. Caring for your pottery\nThe high quality of the clay combined with the manufacturing process make Polish pottery extremely durable. Fired at over 1200°C, it is classed as stoneware and safe to use in dishwashers, microwaves and fridges. This makes Polish pottery suitable for everyday use at home and in catering. All dishes with a grooved bottom are also safe to use in traditional gas or electric ovens up to 280°C, as well as on glass, ceramic and electric hobs.\n\nWhat is Polish Pottery? In simple terms, it is functional art. Broken down in more simple terms, it is a product made from a dense white clay, twice glazed and fired at extremely high temperatures. The region where this comes from used to be part of Germany but is now Boleslawiec, Poland. The clay is the secret here. It is beautifully “white” allowing for various colors to stand out. This makes for the perfect artist pallet and Boleslawiec is a region known for it’s artists. The clay is dense. It does make it heavier but the product is superior. As long as you follow a few simple rules, it will last longer than any of us will. It does not chip like cheaper, lighter stoneware that is more porous. The double glaze allows for a scratch resistant surface that is lead and cadmium free. POLISH POTTERY IT IS 100% SAFE TO USE. IT IS OVEN SAFE, MICROWAVE SAFE, DISHWASHER SAFE AND FREEZER SAFE. In fact I have even cooked an entire dinner in this stoneware using only my grill. I’ll go into depth later about the patterns of polish pottery but for now it’s only important that you know that every single piece is done by hand. The pieces are cast from molds but the painting is unique. There is no mass production in the creation of this product. Orders take 6-9 months to complete. There are different levels of artistry (again, I’ll expand on that in another article) which will affect the price. You’ll notice that 95% of my pictures are taken using Polish pottery. That’s because it is the primary serving and cooking tools in my kitchen. Where can you buy Polish Pottery? Pacific Polish Pottery is the best place. Family owned since 2000, they know everything there is to know. They offer free shipping on orders over $99.00 and they are always listing new pieces. Same day shipping in many cases, reward points and friendly customer service are just a few reasons to visit their store.\n\nSo what is Polish Pottery anyway? Polish pottery has been popping up all over the United States in recent years. It’s been featured in magazines like Better Homes and Gardens. You can find pieces in stores and online. But if you’ve never seen it before, you might be wondering just what exactly is so great about it. So here are 5 great reasons to check out polish pottery for yourself. 1) Polish Pottery is handmade. Polish Pottery is made by hand out of white clay found in Boleslawiec, Poland. The patterns are all hand stamped and\/or hand designed by local artists. This means that each piece is slightly different, which adds to the charm of the pottery. 2) There’s something for everyone. There are hundreds of patterns available in Polish Pottery. Everything from the traditional peacock eye pattern, to beautiful flower patterns. There are seasonal patterns too! Snowmen for Christmas, stars and stripes for 4th of July…you name it and they make it. 3) Durability. I use my Polish Pottery every day and it still looks beautiful. It’s microwave safe, oven safe, and dishwasher safe. It doesn’t chip easily, and it evenly distributes heat to your food. 4) The endless ability to mix and match. Remember those hundreds of patterns we talked about earlier, well you can mix and match them to your heart’s content. Many of the pieces feature similar colors, so they look great together on your table. Decide that you’re bored with stars and peacock eyes, you can always buy a few Blue Tulip or Blue Poppy patterns to mix in. Endless possibilities means endless fun! 5) It’s simply beautiful.

You might notice the dry, rough, cracking bark of a tree, and beneath is the smooth, fresh, unblemished surface. I’m moved by these sensual contrasts. I admire the way you do not overwork a piece to the point where people have to guess or be surprised at what the object is all about, other than the obvious, that it is some sort of vessel. do people tend to see right away a sense of either super primitive, or ultra modern? Paula: I think people realize that my pots contain both a sense of primitive and modern design. they see the ancient and traditional techniques but in new, innovative ways. I leave evidence of the way the piece was constructed. I find beauty in seams and joints. overworking a pot may lead towards a seamless perfection, but it can diminish the sense of fresh energy. I want my work to express the constant fluidity of life that honors material and process. the Japanese term “wabi sabi” describes this aesthetic. It is a way of living that finds beauty in imperfection. What kind of clay do you favor using, and why? Paula: I use a low-fire clay from Sheffield Pottery called Mass White. It has terrific strength at my very low firing temperature. I do a preliminary (bisque) firing in my electric kiln, transforming the clay to a white color. In the smoke firing, “naked” Mass White absorbs less carbon than the areas with the polished slip. the bare clay turns a lovely gray that contrasts nicely with the intense black of the polished slip surface. Paula, tell me more about your firing process. Paula: outside I have small kiln I built from house bricks. I fill this with a mix of hardwood shavings and my pots. I add a bit of newspaper and light it. Within a few minutes, the shavings are burning and I cover the kiln. It burns for about 24 hours. Smoke firing is very unpredictable. on a windy or rainy day the pots can have a very dynamic and smokey look to their surface. over the last few years, I have been working with either texture or line drawings on my work, and do not want the atmospheric, smokey look to detract from the form and surface design. So I had to come up with a way to achieve a more uniform black\/gray surface. to do this, each piece is wrapped individually in a single sheet of newspaper, then in foil, and then placed in the kiln. As the paper burns, the smoke is trapped against the pot by this foil saggar. the results are a very even black\/gray. What do you have in your studio that, say, painters do not have? Paula: In addition to my electric kiln for bisque firing, one of my most frequently used tools is a large rolling pin for rolling out slabs of clay. And of course, I have hundreds of “found tools” for creating various textures. My favorite textures are created from both common and uncommon items: a serrated steak knife, a non-slip\nrug mat, an oversized wooden bead from Africa, and the end of a bamboo paint brush. I also have boxes and boxes filled with objects that I have collected from nature: coral, seed pods, sea grass, tiny animal bones... I use these for impressions in the soft clay and for inspiration. I’ve always loved the glazing process, but your unique surface comes from the use of terra sigillata (polished slip). fascinating! Tell me more! Paula: Yes, I make the terra sigillata myself. It is basically the finest particles of clay separated out from the coarser ones. It is a very refined clay slip that has the consistency of skim milk. I paint multiple coats over the surface of my pot before it is fired. this is done at the bone-dry stage, when the pots are very fragile. At just the right moment, when the terra sigilatta has lost its wet look but still remains moist, I polish the entire surface.\n\nQuestion:What makes a Polish pottery piece a Unikat (Signature) item and how is it different from regular pieces?",

You might notice the dry, rough, cracking bark of a tree, and beneath is the smooth, fresh, unblemished surface. I’m moved by these sensual contrasts. I admire the way you do not overwork a piece to the point where people have to guess or be surprised at what the object is all about, other than the obvious, that it is some sort of vessel. do people tend to see right away a sense of either super primitive, or ultra modern? Paula: I think people realize that my pots contain both a sense of primitive and modern design. they see the ancient and traditional techniques but in new, innovative ways. I leave evidence of the way the piece was constructed. I find beauty in seams and joints. overworking a pot may lead towards a seamless perfection, but it can diminish the sense of fresh energy. I want my work to express the constant fluidity of life that honors material and process. the Japanese term “wabi sabi” describes this aesthetic. It is a way of living that finds beauty in imperfection. What kind of clay do you favor using, and why? Paula: I use a low-fire clay from Sheffield Pottery called Mass White. It has terrific strength at my very low firing temperature. I do a preliminary (bisque) firing in my electric kiln, transforming the clay to a white color. In the smoke firing, “naked” Mass White absorbs less carbon than the areas with the polished slip. the bare clay turns a lovely gray that contrasts nicely with the intense black of the polished slip surface. Paula, tell me more about your firing process. Paula: outside I have small kiln I built from house bricks. I fill this with a mix of hardwood shavings and my pots. I add a bit of newspaper and light it. Within a few minutes, the shavings are burning and I cover the kiln. It burns for about 24 hours. Smoke firing is very unpredictable. on a windy or rainy day the pots can have a very dynamic and smokey look to their surface. over the last few years, I have been working with either texture or line drawings on my work, and do not want the atmospheric, smokey look to detract from the form and surface design. So I had to come up with a way to achieve a more uniform black\/gray surface. to do this, each piece is wrapped individually in a single sheet of newspaper, then in foil, and then placed in the kiln. As the paper burns, the smoke is trapped against the pot by this foil saggar. the results are a very even black\/gray. What do you have in your studio that, say, painters do not have? Paula: In addition to my electric kiln for bisque firing, one of my most frequently used tools is a large rolling pin for rolling out slabs of clay. And of course, I have hundreds of “found tools” for creating various textures. My favorite textures are created from both common and uncommon items: a serrated steak knife, a non-slip\nrug mat, an oversized wooden bead from Africa, and the end of a bamboo paint brush. I also have boxes and boxes filled with objects that I have collected from nature: coral, seed pods, sea grass, tiny animal bones... I use these for impressions in the soft clay and for inspiration. I’ve always loved the glazing process, but your unique surface comes from the use of terra sigillata (polished slip). fascinating! Tell me more! Paula: Yes, I make the terra sigillata myself. It is basically the finest particles of clay separated out from the coarser ones. It is a very refined clay slip that has the consistency of skim milk. I paint multiple coats over the surface of my pot before it is fired. this is done at the bone-dry stage, when the pots are very fragile. At just the right moment, when the terra sigilatta has lost its wet look but still remains moist, I polish the entire surface.",

It is the most classic of summer vacations, especially for families, who follow typically flat and easy-to-drive I-90 for a taste of the Wild West. They encounter Shady Brady hats and jackalopes (rabbits with antlers, stuffed) at Wall Drug Store en route, then Black Hills Gold and red clay pottery, working cowboys and roaming buffalo. This is timeless Americana, but it took until this year for me to make the trek. I didn’t try to over-analyze the destination ahead of time, but simply presumed it would be wholesome, tame and predictable. Getting misty-eyed at the sight of Mount Rushmore and feeling awestruck while watching work on the Crazy Horse Memorial never occurred to me. But that is what happened. This is our land of the free, home of the brave, place where the independent spirit seeks and sets seemingly impossible goals. Not much lasts forever, but these two iconic sculptures feel like exceptions. What a legacy for their creators, which include Donald “Nick” Clifford, one of the last guys alive who helped carve Mount Rushmore. He turns 87 on July 5 and began climbing the mountain for pay at age 17, during the Great Depression. “Back in those days, we were glad to have a job,” Nick says, and he didn’t care whether neighbors classified the mission as foolhardy. Nick – who grew up four curvy, uphill miles from his job – had worked in quartz mines before helping to drill, winch and sandblast a quartet of presidential faces into the mountaintop. This was his job for three years; about 400 men made this their occupation during the 14 years of Mount Rushmore construction. “It makes me proud to be an American, to have worked on something like this,” Nick says. He also played baseball “every day, rain or shine,” as a part of the Mount Rushmore team, which won consecutive-year state championships. Nick was a pitcher and outfielder; for sale are baseballs and books autographed by him. At the Crazy Horse site, 17 miles southwest, no one predicts when work will finish. The massive undertaking (all of Mount Rushmore would fit into the head of nine-story-tall Crazy Horse) began 60 years ago, on July 3, when the first dynamite blast tore off 10 tons of rock. Now the granite rubble exceeds 8 million tons. The face of the revered Indian warrior was unveiled in 1998; he was a Lakota, but this sculpture pays tribute to all tribes. The work began because of Korczak Ziolkowski, the monument’s designer and sole laborer, for a while. He died in 1982. The sculptor began this project at midlife, at the request of a Lakota chief. The work continues because of tour proceeds, private donations and the enthusiasm of the sculptor’s widow, Ruth, who still lives in the mountainside log home that her husband built in the 1940s. “If you love your job, it doesn’t seem like work,” the 81-year-old woman insists. “You are happy and grateful to begin each new day.”\nSeven of the couple’s 10 children also are involved with the project, which Ruth considers “storytelling in stone,” on what others describe as sacred ground. People make a mark on this planet in all kinds of ways. Not living to see the full impact of your thumbprint is irrelevant, when the dream and impulse are intense enough. These two colossal monuments – stellar symbols of independence, character and hope – are one way to define freedom as another Fourth of July approaches. You’ll also find mettle in South Dakota. Consider Sequoia Crosswhite, whose attire, dancing, handmade flutes and musical recordings uphold the traditions and history of his Lakota ancestors. We heard his lilting melodies at Prairie Edge, a spacious and two-story gallery of Native American art\/crafts in Rapid City. Head to Myspace.com to see the musician uphold his roots in another way, through a fusion of hip-rock, rock and lyrics about Indian heritage. “It is up to my generation” to make sure cultural legacies are not abandoned, he says.\n\nThe collection of my grandfather’s photographs that I’ve had the chance to replicate continues this week with a shot of the Crazy Horse Memorial in South Dakota. I’ve been fascinated by viewing the United States through his eyes from photos taken decades ago and now have enjoyed the journey of finding the same locations to see for myself. I hope you come back and check out the progression of the Vintage America project every Friday! Work began on the Crazy Horse Memorial in 1948 and, once completed, it will be the largest sculpture in the world. In the foreground is a model of what the planned Memorial will eventually look like…so while I was amazed at the detail of the face of Crazy Horse, I was also shocked at really how much of the sculpture had yet to be completed. Since the time of my grandfather’s photograph, Crazy Horse has also gained popularity as a must-see tourist attraction, hence the extended observation deck and Visitor Center addition behind the model statue. As I was waiting for the optimal time to capture the same image my grandfather had, it was particularly satisfying to have conversations with people regarding my project and see their excitement about it. One older woman even asked to take a picture of me holding my grandfather’s photo! All throughout my trip I came across people who were genuinely excited about my mission, which further confirmed that the venture I’m undertaking is a worthwhile endeavor. I hope that all of you feel the same and that you’ll continue to follow and support the project! Don’t miss any future Vintage America posts, subscribe for email updates!\n\nIn front of the monument is the avenue of floats which shows when each state joined the union. In the visitors centre they had an exhibition on the sculptor and the creation.It truly was a fantastic place to see! I feel so lucky that we got to see it too! We drove the short distance from Mount Rushmore to Crazy Horse Memorial, which is a bit different as it’s a memorial not yet completed. The Crazy Horse Memorial, is a tribute to the Lakota leader, Crazy Horse. He was a warrior and an instrumental part in the battle of Little Bighorn. He was killed in 1877 in Nebraska. He was only in his thirties. On September 6th every year, a night last at the memorial is held to honour Crazy Horse’s short but legendary life as well as the birth of the sculptor, Korczak Ziolkowski. Ziolkowski was invited by Lakota Chief Henry Standing Beat to carve the sculpture of Crazy Horse. It stands to honour the culture and heritage of all North American Indians. Ziolkowski was unsure to begin with as he didn’t think Crazy Horse had necessarily done anything to perhaps warrant a memoria but it turns out it was to be more of a memorial to his spirit. His left hand would be pointed forward because he was asked by a white man once, “Where are your lands now?” Crazy Horse replied, “My lands are where my dead lie buried.” The Native Indians, had their own customs and way of living which was taken away from them after the battle of Little Bighorn. Ziolkowski maintened the idea that the memorial and foundation should be solely privately funded and nothing taken from the government. To this day it remains privately funded from tourists flocking to the visitors centre and surrounding areas. It also remained a family affair with Ziolkowski’s wife Ruth and ten children either working in the mountain , serving in the board or running the gift shop and visitors centre. They showed a video about this which was really quite moving! Ruth passed in 2014 but the children continue to work there!From here it was on to Jewel Cave National Monument. There is so much to see and do in South Dakota! Our passes didn’t get us entry on to the tour here but that didn’t matter as we were excited to see another cave. Jewel Cave isn’t as long as Mammoth Cave and comes in at 189 miles and still exploring! Everywhere we have visited so far today sits in the Black Hills region of South Dakota. Jewel cave was established as a national monument in 1908. Ranger Gregory asked “who by?” To which I replied Roosevelt, citing that it was the President, Theodore Roosevelt who designated it. I then got called a brown nose for the trip because I answered the “rhetorical question.” Or I have just paid attention to everywhere we have been…😂\nWe descended an elevator (yes an elevator in an old cave) to 240ft below the surface.The cave only had a mile explored when it became a national monument in 1908 and it wasn’t until the 1960s when Herb and Jan Conn spent 21 years leading caving trips and mapping 65 miles of the cave. Since then it has been explored to 189 miles with no sign of stopping! The map of the cave shows different levels depending on colour and each room and place that has been uncovered has been named. It’s a first come first name basis so whoever finds it, names it. There are some interesting names such as, the ‘big duh’ for the biggest room in the cave so far, ‘the good the bad and the ugly,’ ‘no way through,’ amongst others. The whole bits in the photo are calcite crystal.Huge flowstone above\nJewel cave is named for its jewel-like calcite crystals surrounding the passageways. The cave consists of stalactites, soda straws (not to be drunk from), flowstone and pillars. It is one of the worlds largest caves and probably only had 3-5% of it mapped, so it’s gonna be huge!Anyone for Cave bacon for breakfast? Might hurt your teeth and taste like dirt? Another fascinating formation from deep below our surface! As I was listening to our guide, Ranger Gregory, I was feeling more and more compelled to sign up to become a cave explorer! I mean it literally does sound incredibly fun and satisfying! Then he said that it could take 7-8 hours to get to the camp within the cave and then another three hours to the edge of the cave.\n\nThe easiest way to visit the Crazy Horse Memorial is to fly to Sioux City, South Dakota, and rent a car. There are plenty of moderately priced hotels in the town of Custer. It’s worth spending several days exploring the Black Hills, which have a haunting beauty (they are the oldest mountains in North America). www.crazyhorse.org www.southdakotahotels.org\nIt’s a blast: Explosions carve the features of Lakota warrior Crazy Horse\n\nLast Thursday I flew out to Sioux Falls, South Dakota. I know what you're thinking, South Dakota? ABRAMS flew myself and Jason Wells out there on a top secret mission. But of course its a secret one that I will reveal on Monday. But in the mean time here are a bunch of photos from my South Dakota adventure\nAfter breakfast we were ready completed our mission. Here is a sneak peak. Then we hit the road to see what South Dakota had to offer.S. Dakota offered a 75 mph state highway. At times I was going a tad fast ( 100 mph ) as we drove across the state with Mount Rushmore and the Black Hills in our site. Just down the road from Mount Rushmore is the Crazy Horse Memorial\nThe mountain carving was begun in 1948 by a Polish American sculptor Korczak Ziółkowski, who had worked on Mount Rushmore under Gutzon Borglum in 1924. This is what Crazy Horse will look like when finished\nThey have a long way to go.\n\nAbout this Event\n12151 Ave of Chiefs, Crazy Horse, SD 57730https:\/\/crazyhorsememorial.org\/visit\/special-events\/volksmarch\/ #CrazyHorseMemorial\nThe bi-annual Crazy Horse MemorialⓇ Volksmarch (an organized hike) is a 10K or 6.2-mile woodlands ramble to the world’s largest mountain carving in progress in the southern Black Hills of South Dakota. Notes: The trail rises 500 feet and can be rugged with some steep inclines. The final elevation is 6,532 feet. There are 4 checkpoints along the\nroute with portable restrooms. Sturdy footwear is recommended. Plan on 2-4 hours round-trip. The Hike can be canceled due to poor\n\nCRAZY HORSE’S REVENGE\nFrom Page 1\nThe momentum led to the opening of a cathedral-like visitors centre in 2000, with a museum, Native American cultural centre (where local artists come to work), bustling restaurant and state-of-the-art cinema. Crazy Horse is squarely on the western sightseeing circuit, although it still maintains its down-home, family feel, perhaps because seven of Ziolkowski’s children still work full time on the site and 28 of his grandchildren are seasonal waiters in the restaurant. Although carving is proceeding on the 22-storey-high horse’s head, nobody in the family will discuss when the monolith may be finished. ‘‘ There’s no way to estimate,’’ says Ruth, Ziolkowski’s widow, in her mid70s, when we meet for a lunch of tacos. ‘‘ It would be nothing but a wild guess anyway. We’re not trying to be difficult. We just don’t know. ‘‘ Korczak always said it wasn’t important when it was finished.’’\nLater, wearing a hard hat, I visit the worksite, strolling along Crazy Horse’s outstretched arm and drinking in a view that seems to stretch to New York City. The work is overseen by the Ziolkowskis’ eldest son, Casimir, who talks about his father with wry affection. ‘‘ He was one of a kind, that’s for sure,’’ he says with a laugh. ‘‘ We had our fights, like every father and son.’’\nWorkers are diligently laying dynamite, although they are also using tools that would have been science fiction to Ziolkowski when he was alive: groundpenetrating radar, electronic detonators, precision explosives and 3300C torches to polish the granite. Daughter Monique prefers to plot the carving using a scale model, as her father did in the ’ 50s. She uses plumblines to measure distances, like the ancient Greeks; relying on a computer, she says, ‘‘ feels like cheating’’. ‘‘ Only in America could a man carve a mountain,’’ Ziolkowski once declared, a sentiment that, perhaps unsurprisingly, has not won over all Native Americans. In recent years a group called the Defenders of the Black Hills has argued that the region, which is sacred to the Lakota, should be left alone. Spokeswoman Charmaine Whiteface says the fact that this new sculpture involves an image of a revered Lakota leader does not make it less of a violation than Mt Rushmore. Work should simply stop on Crazy Horse, she says. ‘‘ Let nature reclaim the mountain.’’\nBut this is the US and nobody leaves a project half-finished. Today, Crazy Horse is going from strength to strength; there are even two annual festivals that encourage visitors from across the nation to enjoy the Black Hills’ crisp summer nights. The first is on June 26, the anniversary of the battle of Little Bighorn as well as Ruth Ziolkowski’s birthday; the second, on September 6, is Korczak Ziolkowski’s birthday and, according to Lakota sources, the anniversary of Crazy Horse’s early death at Fort Robinson. On my last night in South Dakota, I visit the September extravaganza, joining a stream of about 3000 picnickers sitting on hillsides beneath the stars. A Technicolor laser show turns the halfcarved mountainside into an enormous cinema screen on which Native American petroglyphs and historic photographs are projected to the sound of music and narration. Finally, in the darkness, roars go up as 20 consecutive dynamite blasts shoot out along Crazy Horse’s arm, giving a spectacular breath of life to the sculpture. Driving back to my hotel that night, I see the name of the Lakota’s white enemy, Custer, marked everywhere on the Black Hills. Today he is commemorated in the Custer State Forest, where buffalo have been reintroduced after coming close to extermination. (The US Army funded buffalo hunting to wipe out Native American food supplies.) The largest town in the Black Hills is called Custer. And, bizarrely, white townsfolk have even put the Custer name on a mountainside in large white capital letters, like the famous Hollywood sign. But after the night of celebrations at Crazy Horse, it feels as if the historic balance is at least starting to be redressed.\n\nI have upgraded my blog editing program, so now you should not be seeing any advertisements and I should be able to insert little videos. Let’s see how well this works. Up at the crack of dawn, we were off to look for wildlife. Custer State Park has a wildlife loop where we found what we were looking for. We saw a huge herd of buffalo. Click on the arrow in the middle of this pic and see if it plays for you. While we were watching the herd a biker came through, slow and cautious, and suddenly one of the larger animals jumped out from the side of the road and head-butted the biker nearly knocking him down. He wobbled a bit but then got control and continued on. When he got by us he said it was a scary thing, and when the lady on the bike behind him came by she was saying “Oh God, Oh God, Oh God.” It was a close one, that’s for sure. There were wild donkeys relaxing on the side of the road. One was napping. If you read this blog last year you will recognize these pictures. We were here in September on our way back to Minnesota from our Alaska trip. Well, here we are again. We’re in the area so just had to see it all again. We spent a few hours at Mount Rushmore. There is a trail that leaves from the observation deck that you can hike for a closer look. Along that hike we got a glimpse of a mountain goat. And, of course, if you see Mount Rushmore you must also visit the Crazy Horse Memorial, so that’s what we did. They’ve been working on it for years, and I doubt they will have it done in my lifetime. We spent a couple of hours there too, they have an awesome visitor center. At the restaurant there we had to have South Dakota’s Official State Dessert….KUCHEN\nOn our way home be saw this lone antelope and stopped to watch it for a while. - Gasoline: none\n- Lodging: $26\n- Admission: $11 to park, but Mt. Rushmore is free (your tax dollars at work)\n- Admission: $22 Crazy Horse Memorial (no Federal or State dollars go here)\n- Admission: Custer State Park (7-day pass), $15\n\nAfter a day of fishing and horseback riding, enjoy your evening by viewing Mt. Rushmore at the lighting ceremony. You will also want to head over to the Crazy Horse Memorial which is larger than all four heads of Mt. Rushmore. Surely a remarkable site to see!

The work began because of Korczak Ziolkowski, the monument’s designer and sole laborer, for a while. He died in 1982. The sculptor began this project at midlife, at the request of a Lakota chief. The work continues because of tour proceeds, private donations and the enthusiasm of the sculptor’s widow, Ruth, who still lives in the mountainside log home that her husband built in the 1940s. “If you love your job, it doesn’t seem like work,” the 81-year-old woman insists. “You are happy and grateful to begin each new day.”\nSeven of the couple’s 10 children also are involved with the project, which Ruth considers “storytelling in stone,” on what others describe as sacred ground. People make a mark on this planet in all kinds of ways. Not living to see the full impact of your thumbprint is irrelevant, when the dream and impulse are intense enough. These two colossal monuments – stellar symbols of independence, character and hope – are one way to define freedom as another Fourth of July approaches. You’ll also find mettle in South Dakota. Consider Sequoia Crosswhite, whose attire, dancing, handmade flutes and musical recordings uphold the traditions and history of his Lakota ancestors. We heard his lilting melodies at Prairie Edge, a spacious and two-story gallery of Native American art\/crafts in Rapid City. Head to Myspace.com to see the musician uphold his roots in another way, through a fusion of hip-rock, rock and lyrics about Indian heritage. “It is up to my generation” to make sure cultural legacies are not abandoned, he says.",

            "passage": "The collection of my grandfather’s photographs that I’ve had the chance to replicate continues this week with a shot of the Crazy Horse Memorial in South Dakota. I’ve been fascinated by viewing the United States through his eyes from photos taken decades ago and now have enjoyed the journey of finding the same locations to see for myself. I hope you come back and check out the progression of the Vintage America project every Friday! Work began on the Crazy Horse Memorial in 1948 and, once completed, it will be the largest sculpture in the world. In the foreground is a model of what the planned Memorial will eventually look like…so while I was amazed at the detail of the face of Crazy Horse, I was also shocked at really how much of the sculpture had yet to be completed. Since the time of my grandfather’s photograph, Crazy Horse has also gained popularity as a must-see tourist attraction, hence the extended observation deck and Visitor Center addition behind the model statue. As I was waiting for the optimal time to capture the same image my grandfather had, it was particularly satisfying to have conversations with people regarding my project and see their excitement about it. One older woman even asked to take a picture of me holding my grandfather’s photo! All throughout my trip I came across people who were genuinely excited about my mission, which further confirmed that the venture I’m undertaking is a worthwhile endeavor. I hope that all of you feel the same and that you’ll continue to follow and support the project! Don’t miss any future Vintage America posts, subscribe for email updates!",

In the visitors centre they had an exhibition on the sculptor and the creation.It truly was a fantastic place to see! I feel so lucky that we got to see it too! We drove the short distance from Mount Rushmore to Crazy Horse Memorial, which is a bit different as it’s a memorial not yet completed. The Crazy Horse Memorial, is a tribute to the Lakota leader, Crazy Horse. He was a warrior and an instrumental part in the battle of Little Bighorn. He was killed in 1877 in Nebraska. He was only in his thirties. On September 6th every year, a night last at the memorial is held to honour Crazy Horse’s short but legendary life as well as the birth of the sculptor, Korczak Ziolkowski. Ziolkowski was invited by Lakota Chief Henry Standing Beat to carve the sculpture of Crazy Horse. It stands to honour the culture and heritage of all North American Indians. Ziolkowski was unsure to begin with as he didn’t think Crazy Horse had necessarily done anything to perhaps warrant a memoria but it turns out it was to be more of a memorial to his spirit. His left hand would be pointed forward because he was asked by a white man once, “Where are your lands now?” Crazy Horse replied, “My lands are where my dead lie buried.” The Native Indians, had their own customs and way of living which was taken away from them after the battle of Little Bighorn. Ziolkowski maintened the idea that the memorial and foundation should be solely privately funded and nothing taken from the government. To this day it remains privately funded from tourists flocking to the visitors centre and surrounding areas. It also remained a family affair with Ziolkowski’s wife Ruth and ten children either working in the mountain , serving in the board or running the gift shop and visitors centre. They showed a video about this which was really quite moving! Ruth passed in 2014 but the children continue to work there!From here it was on to Jewel Cave National Monument. There is so much to see and do in South Dakota! Our passes didn’t get us entry on to the tour here but that didn’t matter as we were excited to see another cave. Jewel Cave isn’t as long as Mammoth Cave and comes in at 189 miles and still exploring! Everywhere we have visited so far today sits in the Black Hills region of South Dakota. Jewel cave was established as a national monument in 1908. Ranger Gregory asked “who by?” To which I replied Roosevelt, citing that it was the President, Theodore Roosevelt who designated it. I then got called a brown nose for the trip because I answered the “rhetorical question.” Or I have just paid attention to everywhere we have been…😂\nWe descended an elevator (yes an elevator in an old cave) to 240ft below the surface.The cave only had a mile explored when it became a national monument in 1908 and it wasn’t until the 1960s when Herb and Jan Conn spent 21 years leading caving trips and mapping 65 miles of the cave. Since then it has been explored to 189 miles with no sign of stopping! The map of the cave shows different levels depending on colour and each room and place that has been uncovered has been named. It’s a first come first name basis so whoever finds it, names it. There are some interesting names such as, the ‘big duh’ for the biggest room in the cave so far, ‘the good the bad and the ugly,’ ‘no way through,’ amongst others. The whole bits in the photo are calcite crystal.Huge flowstone above\nJewel cave is named for its jewel-like calcite crystals surrounding the passageways. The cave consists of stalactites, soda straws (not to be drunk from), flowstone and pillars. It is one of the worlds largest caves and probably only had 3-5% of it mapped, so it’s gonna be huge!Anyone for Cave bacon for breakfast? Might hurt your teeth and taste like dirt? Another fascinating formation from deep below our surface! As I was listening to our guide, Ranger Gregory, I was feeling more and more compelled to sign up to become a cave explorer! I mean it literally does sound incredibly fun and satisfying! Then he said that it could take 7-8 hours to get to the camp within the cave and then another three hours to the edge of the cave.",

            "passage": "CRAZY HORSE’S REVENGE\nFrom Page 1\nThe momentum led to the opening of a cathedral-like visitors centre in 2000, with a museum, Native American cultural centre (where local artists come to work), bustling restaurant and state-of-the-art cinema. Crazy Horse is squarely on the western sightseeing circuit, although it still maintains its down-home, family feel, perhaps because seven of Ziolkowski’s children still work full time on the site and 28 of his grandchildren are seasonal waiters in the restaurant. Although carving is proceeding on the 22-storey-high horse’s head, nobody in the family will discuss when the monolith may be finished. ‘‘ There’s no way to estimate,’’ says Ruth, Ziolkowski’s widow, in her mid70s, when we meet for a lunch of tacos. ‘‘ It would be nothing but a wild guess anyway. We’re not trying to be difficult. We just don’t know. ‘‘ Korczak always said it wasn’t important when it was finished.’’\nLater, wearing a hard hat, I visit the worksite, strolling along Crazy Horse’s outstretched arm and drinking in a view that seems to stretch to New York City. The work is overseen by the Ziolkowskis’ eldest son, Casimir, who talks about his father with wry affection. ‘‘ He was one of a kind, that’s for sure,’’ he says with a laugh. ‘‘ We had our fights, like every father and son.’’\nWorkers are diligently laying dynamite, although they are also using tools that would have been science fiction to Ziolkowski when he was alive: groundpenetrating radar, electronic detonators, precision explosives and 3300C torches to polish the granite. Daughter Monique prefers to plot the carving using a scale model, as her father did in the ’ 50s. She uses plumblines to measure distances, like the ancient Greeks; relying on a computer, she says, ‘‘ feels like cheating’’. ‘‘ Only in America could a man carve a mountain,’’ Ziolkowski once declared, a sentiment that, perhaps unsurprisingly, has not won over all Native Americans. In recent years a group called the Defenders of the Black Hills has argued that the region, which is sacred to the Lakota, should be left alone. Spokeswoman Charmaine Whiteface says the fact that this new sculpture involves an image of a revered Lakota leader does not make it less of a violation than Mt Rushmore. Work should simply stop on Crazy Horse, she says. ‘‘ Let nature reclaim the mountain.’’\nBut this is the US and nobody leaves a project half-finished. Today, Crazy Horse is going from strength to strength; there are even two annual festivals that encourage visitors from across the nation to enjoy the Black Hills’ crisp summer nights. The first is on June 26, the anniversary of the battle of Little Bighorn as well as Ruth Ziolkowski’s birthday; the second, on September 6, is Korczak Ziolkowski’s birthday and, according to Lakota sources, the anniversary of Crazy Horse’s early death at Fort Robinson. On my last night in South Dakota, I visit the September extravaganza, joining a stream of about 3000 picnickers sitting on hillsides beneath the stars. A Technicolor laser show turns the halfcarved mountainside into an enormous cinema screen on which Native American petroglyphs and historic photographs are projected to the sound of music and narration. Finally, in the darkness, roars go up as 20 consecutive dynamite blasts shoot out along Crazy Horse’s arm, giving a spectacular breath of life to the sculpture. Driving back to my hotel that night, I see the name of the Lakota’s white enemy, Custer, marked everywhere on the Black Hills. Today he is commemorated in the Custer State Forest, where buffalo have been reintroduced after coming close to extermination. (The US Army funded buffalo hunting to wipe out Native American food supplies.) The largest town in the Black Hills is called Custer. And, bizarrely, white townsfolk have even put the Custer name on a mountainside in large white capital letters, like the famous Hollywood sign. But after the night of celebrations at Crazy Horse, it feels as if the historic balance is at least starting to be redressed.",

Click on the arrow in the middle of this pic and see if it plays for you. While we were watching the herd a biker came through, slow and cautious, and suddenly one of the larger animals jumped out from the side of the road and head-butted the biker nearly knocking him down. He wobbled a bit but then got control and continued on. When he got by us he said it was a scary thing, and when the lady on the bike behind him came by she was saying “Oh God, Oh God, Oh God.” It was a close one, that’s for sure. There were wild donkeys relaxing on the side of the road. One was napping. If you read this blog last year you will recognize these pictures.

    "question": "What's the best way to manage inventory for a service business?",
    "gold": "Service businesses can manage inventory using several methods, including the EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) model for basic inventory control and its extensions. For businesses dealing with uncertain demand and lead times, there are specific models available. The newsvendor problem approach is particularly useful when dealing with perishable items or services with time-sensitive demand.",
    "answer": "Managing inventory for a service business can be slightly different compared to a retail or manufacturing business, as the focus is primarily on managing resources and materials rather than physical products. However, effective inventory management is still crucial for service businesses to ensure they have the necessary resources to meet customer demands efficiently and cost-effectively. Here are some strategies to effectively manage inventory for a service business:\n\n1. **Identify and Categorize Resources**: Just like in a retail or manufacturing setting, categorize your resources based on their importance, usage frequency, and value. This could include raw materials, consumables, equipment, or any other items essential for delivering your services.\n\n2. **Implement a Just-in-Time (JIT) Inventory System**: For service businesses, adopting a JIT approach can help minimize inventory holding costs. This involves ordering or producing resources only when they are needed, reducing waste, and keeping costs down.\n\n3. **Use Inventory Management Software**: Invest in software that can track your resources in real-time. This will help in monitoring inventory levels, identifying trends, and making informed decisions about when to reorder.\n\n4. **Maintain Accurate Records**: Keep detailed records of all inventory transactions, including receipts, usage, and disposal. This will help in avoiding shortages or excesses and in maintaining a proper inventory turnover.\n\n5. **Optimize Supplier Relationships**: Build strong relationships with your suppliers. This will help in negotiating better terms, ensuring a steady supply of resources, and potentially accessing priority deliveries during peak demand periods.\n\n6. **Regularly Review and Adjust Inventory Levels**: Periodically review your inventory levels and adjust them based on business needs, seasonal demands, and changes in customer preferences. This can help in avoiding overstocking or stockouts.\n\n7. **Implement a Strong Procurement Process**: Develop a clear procurement process that includes identifying suppliers, comparing prices, negotiating terms, and placing orders. This can help in minimizing costs and ensuring timely deliveries.\n\n8. **Monitor Inventory Turnover Ratios**: Regularly calculate and monitor your inventory turnover ratios. This will help you understand how efficiently you are managing your inventory and identify areas for improvement.\n\n9. **Invest in Training and Development**: Ensure your staff is well-trained in inventory management techniques and understands the importance of maintaining accurate records. Well-trained employees are less likely to make errors and more effective in managing inventory.\n\n10. **Consider Implementing a Barcode System**: For larger service businesses, a barcode system can greatly enhance inventory management by allowing for quick and accurate tracking of resources.\n\nBy following these strategies, service businesses can effectively manage their inventory, ensuring they have the right resources at the right time to deliver quality service to their customers while optimizing costs and efficiency.",

If you are overstocked, have high levels of slow moving stock or obsolete stock, then you have invested cash without approval and you do not have an effective inventory policy. You wouldn’t let any other significant expenditure be made without a detailed approval process, so why inventory? Here are a few points on how to manage your inventory effectively. Make to Order (MTO) vs. Make to Stock (MTS)\nIf you are a manufacturing business then you should be carefully analysing the MTO and MTS. You should assess the frequency, value and volume of each product and then overlay this information with the commercial strategy. If a product is sold infrequently, generates low returns, and does not form part of a wider commercial offering, then it should not be MTS. In fact, it should probably be delisted altogether. It doesn’t make sense to invest your cash in all products equally. Isn’t it better to have more stock, and consequently a better service level, for those products that generate the most sales and the most revenue? This is the purpose of an ABC classification. An ABC classification, sometimes called ‘runners, repeaters, strangers’, is an opportunity to focus cash, and improved service levels, at the products that are critically important to your business. Broadly speaking your inventory targets should be comprised of two components, cycle stock and safety stock. Cycle stock is straightforward – it is the mean expected demand during the replenishment lead time. Safety stock is more complex, and often overlooked. Safety stock is a probability assessment of demand exceeding the mean during the replenishment lead time, combined with the probability of delays in the replenishment lead time. This should be properly calculated – rules of thumb do not work and will leave you with too little or too much stock. Devising an inventory policy is not a one-off exercise. As your business profile changes, new products will come in, old products will go out and sales will increase and decrease. These factors will impact your inventory targets and consequently you should be making revisions to your MTO\/MTS, portfolio classification and inventory targets periodically. If you do not have inventory management software then simple models can be developed in MS Excel to achieve this. Developing an inventory policy is not just about the known numbers; it is not purely an analytical exercise. You need to ensure that the analysis is overlaid with the expectations of the product life cycle, market promotions, sales strategies and commercial forecasts. It is important that there is cross-functional consensus from the commercial, finance and operations teams on the levels of inventory being targeted. Once you have an inventory policy established and a process for periodic review, then you should be looking at levers on how you can work to reduce stock. There are a number of methods you can use, but typically businesses should focus on:\n- Modifying service levels (reducing service against ‘B’ & ‘C’ class items);\n- Increasing MTO;\n- Introducing minimum order quantities (MOQs) for customers;\n- Negotiating higher frequency, lower volume deliveries with suppliers;\n- Rationalising the portfolio;\n- Improving forecasting and considering implementing Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP).\n\nPlus, as with any task where humans are involved, the risk of human error is potentially high, particularly if employees feel rushed to complete the process as quickly as possible to keep labor costs down. It’s also difficult to locate the source of any mismatched numbers in a periodic system because so much time passes between counts that it’s hard to know when and where the numbers became off. Smaller organizations tend to benefit more from periodic systems because the cost involved are more manageable with less inventory and fewer labor hours to consider. Perpetual inventory control systems take a different approach. Instead of only tracking inventory at periodic intervals, you track each item throughout its journey across your facility. From the moment you receive it, to the moment it is used in your operations, sold, or scrapped, it’s tracked. You get up-to-the-minute data on precisely where your items are and what they’re being used for. This data is gathered from sensors, barcodes, and scanners that keep tabs on items in real time, helping to eliminate errors from miscounts and helping your team pull inventory items more efficiently. The moment out-of-stock items are received and allocated to the proper bin, your team can be notified and begin using them immediately, instead of sitting on the shelf waiting for the next cycle count. The challenges of perpetual systems are different that those for periodic systems. Instead of needing large amounts of labor to perform counts, you need to invest money upfront in the sensors, barcodes, scanners, software, and other technology that helps you collect your data. And the more locations you have, the more equipment you need to buy. You’ll still need to perform cycle counts periodically to reconcile any incorrect numbers, but it’s far less often than with a periodic system. Ultimately, periodic inventory control systems are typically best suited for smaller organizations with few inventory items to manage and track. For larger companies with hundreds of items to keep track of, a perpetual control system is the more cost-effective option. How do I cost-effectively manage inventory? Alright so, you need to control you inventory to keep your costs down, but what’s the best way to do that? There are essentially three ways to manage inventory, regardless of what control system you use:\n- Paper checklists\n- Inventory management software\nEach system can be useful, but only one will help you keep costs down and improve your ROI. Let’s find out which one. Pen and paper checklists\nBelieve it or not, there are still many companies that attempt to manage their entire inventory with a pen and paper. This can work, if you are a very small business with just a few items that aren’t very critical to your operations. Doing everything by hand significantly increases the potential for human error and it requires a lot of time spent away from more productive tasks. The next step up from a pad of paper is spreadsheets. You can store an enormous amount of data in them, and your team can update them instantly as needed. The problem with spreadsheets is that when someone updates them, suddenly that specific version of the file is now the most up to date so if unless the next updates the exact same file, you no longer have a unified source of data. Spreadsheets still require manual updates and modifications so you’re still spending money for someone to keep that spreadsheet updated. While they can get the job done in some cases, spreadsheets are still not the most cost-effective way to manage complex inventories. Inventory management software\nData and automation are the tools of industry and are proven to help control costs and improve ROI. Apply these powerful tools to your inventory with inventory management software to get more from your inventory. With this software, you can implement a robust perpetual control system and track every item across your entire operation, even across multiple facilities. The best part about this is that you can instantly see where you inventory costs are going. Instead of waiting to reconcile your inventory accounting a few times a year, you can quickly tell which parts are not being used efficiently and which parts you aren’t using as much. In fact, most organizations don’t use as much as 90% of their MRO inventory every year and your software solution can show you what parts aren’t being utilized efficiently. Remember that money we were leaving on the table with inefficient purchasing and ordering methods for restocking inventory? Inventory management software helps ensure you don’t miss a single dollar.\n\nAre you looking for an effective way to manage and track inventory in your business?

In today’s digital world, there is no excuse not to use technology to help manage a business. Discover the ways you can encourage your field service clients to increase their profitability and improve their business operations. As an accountant working with field service businesses, how do you help your clients manage, or increase, their profitability? If you want to add value to your field service partnerships, providing tools for your clients to run operations more efficiently, avoid losing profits and make smart decisions is something you might want to add to the top of your list. Here are three ways you can help your field service clients increase their profitability. Tip 1: Use workflow automation to streamline operations\nAlthough technology is widely used by businesses large and small, many businesses in the field service industry continue to run operations on paper. Field service management software, job management software, and other cloud-based software platforms provide workflow automation - the automatic execution of manual processes based on workflow rules. When businesses automate their processes, they can increase efficiency by working smarter rather than harder. How does workflow automation increase efficiency? Let’s say field staff are manually recording job details on paper and then bringing those slips of paper into a physical office. In this scenario, important information could go missing, office staff might spend unnecessary time deciphering messy handwriting, and data is recorded twice (once by their field staff and then again by the person handling billing and invoicing). Software with workflow automation capabilities as well as desktop and mobile features will help decrease the amount of errors created in transferring job details, remove the time spent on double data entry, and minimize the chance the information goes missing as it would now be automatically entered into your system. Overall, workflow automation helps businesses save time thus increasing billable hours, and increased billable hours leads to increased profits. Tip 2: Manage inventory from the cloud to avoid losing profits\nHow do your field service clients manage their inventory? Without a central location to track inventory and keep up with material costs, it is easy for field service businesses to lose track of what is in their warehouse or in the vans of their field staff. Encourage your clients to use inventory tracking software to gain full visibility of the materials on hand. This directly ties back into increasing profits as a clear picture into inventory levels will help these businesses make better purchasing decisions, avoid overstock and deter field staff from buying materials at a higher price on site. Some inventory management systems even allow users to import supplier catalogs and compare them side by side to determine the best pricing. Without cloud-based inventory management, field service businesses could be manually combing through supplier catalogs to find pricing, spend hours manually counting materials in their warehouse, or constantly need to follow up with field staff to determine what materials are on their vans. When all inventory-related information is housed in the cloud, determining inventory levels is quick and easy. Tip 3: Generate reports to make more profitable decisions\nWhen your field service clients have more information, you are able to help them make better-informed decisions. Generating reports through a field service management system is an easy way to gather data in one place and make sense of the data at hand. Encourage your clients to regularly use reporting in order to collect data from the day-to-day to discover trends within their business. For example, if a field service business wants to discover which jobs are most profitable versus those that are least profitable, a contract profitability report would be extremely helpful. This type of report would show the amount spent on resources and materials, the amount of time it took to complete a job or project, the total amount invoiced and other important details. Field service clients would be able to view the gross and net profits and compare across jobs to see which jobs are causing them to lose money and which ones bring in more money at less cost. Reporting on this type of information helps you assist your field service clients in making more profitable decisions. When your reporting is tied to a larger field service management solution, field service clients can automatically create reports based on data in their system and even set automation rules to receive scheduled reports at specified times. Workflow automation, cloud-based inventory management and reporting are three simple ways for field service businesses to successfully increase the profitability.

Inventory is often the largest asset a company has.\n\n5 Inventory Planning Best Practices\nIn a session we co-presented at the recent National Conference on Operations & Fulfillment in Las Vegas, we led a panel that delivered the following top five inventory planning best practices:\n- Build partnerships with suppliers. View your suppliers as subordinates and they’ll simply do your bidding. Work with them as partners and you’ll succeed together. You'll achieve more sales — with higher fulfillment, fewer overstocks and better inventory turnover — if you have a partner relationship with suppliers. Communicate with suppliers comprehensively and often. If they can anticipate your needs, they have a better chance of having raw materials and manufacturing capacity available when you need it. Establish these relationships so suppliers can tell you any bad news before delays in production or delivery impact your business. - Capture shadow or lost demand. Incomplete or inaccurate demand data leads to faulty demand planning and inaccurate purchasing decisions. What's more, it negatively impacts staff efficiency. Without accurate demand data, merchants can make incorrect decisions about strong vs. weak sellers. In addition, not capturing lost demand understates response rates and average order size, potentially impacting future list selection. - Measure both order and item fulfillment. Order fulfillment is the best measure of customer satisfaction. It gauges the percentage of customers that are shipped their orders complete at the time of order. The best measure of inventory buying performance is item fulfillment. This measures the percentage of individual items that are shipped to customers when ordered. Understand the relationship between the two so individual inventory buyers can comprehend their impact on total customer experience. - Forecast Internet demand. With Web sales growing to more than 50 percent of total sales for many catalogers, there's growing concern about how best to forecast. First, understand the true source of the demand. On average, only 10 percent to 20 percent of Internet demand is truly “incremental” and not driven by other media. There are two main approaches to online forecasting: time-phased modeling and traditional offer-based forecasting with demand curves. Both are valid. Ensure that you understand the marketing dynamics of your business to apply the appropriate mix of the two forecasting models. For details, see Ray Goodman’s March 2009 Catalog Success article, “Grab the Bull by Both Horns.”\n- Build processes for speed. Every day yields new information to consider. Success is directly related to the speed of receiving, processing and acting on new information. Whether it’s reforecasting demand, placing new purchase orders or adjusting existing ones, build systems and processes that maximize speed.

The key to an efficient and profitable business is total visibility into the inventory process from start to finish and management tools to help you maintain optimal stock levels year-round. An effective inventory management system helps you streamline all the moving parts of your warehouse: From recommending optimal stock levels all the way to keeping your supply chain organized and running smoothly. Learn the basics of inventory management and discover how an inventory management system can help you increase profitability and reduce waste. Inventory is usually one of the largest assets a company owns, which is why inventory mismanagement is one of the top reasons small businesses fail. Inefficient asset inventory management can decrease your profitability in several ways:\nHaving more stock on hand than you actually need can cost you. You have to pay for more warehouse space, which is expensive, and perishable items can spoil before you’re able to sell them. Staying ahead of the curve on retail trends helps you capitalize on the popular items customers want at the moment. If you’re slow to adapt to the changing market, however, customers will look elsewhere and you’ll surrender market share. Customers will order from somewhere else if you don’t have what they want in stock. At the very least, stockouts will cost you sales. If they happen often, you’ll lose customers. Investing in an inventory management system can yield excellent ROI. Not only does an inventory management system make it easier to get your products to the customers who want them, it can provide valuable insights so that you’re ordering the right inventory at the right time and in the right quantities. Here are some examples of how investing in inventory management pays off:\nOrder inventory in the right quantities at the right time so that you’re never over- or under-stocked. More productivity and less time wasted looking for missing items or tracking things by hand. Well-managed stock leads to more efficient and organized warehouses. Orders ship faster and are more accurate, leading to satisfied customers and upheld service level agreements. Inventory is considered a business asset, so inventory management ties in closely with accounting. When inventory and accounting are integrated well, you get real-time metrics into your goods at every step of the process. Your inventory management system should support multiple inventory valuation methods and functions such as:\nThe cost of goods sold divided by average inventory on hand. Low turnover rate indicates duplicate orders and deteriorating inventory value. High turnover rate can mean excess shipping costs to quickly replace things that are out of stock, incomplete orders, and wasted time trying to locate missing items. Balanced turnover rate indicates high efficiency, lower costs, and higher customer satisfaction. The cost of available goods for sale divided by the number of units for sale. This metric yields the weighted average cost per unit. Estimate of the expected cost for an item in the accounting records, which is periodically checked against the actual cost. The variance between the two numbers is recorded in the accounting records. This method is used when it’s too time-consuming to track actual costs in real time. Refers to the list of sub-items that make up a single inventory item. Bundling the parts and items that make up a single finished item. A logistics term that refers to receiving inventory just before or at the exact time it’s needed. Tracks inventory from manufacturing to when it’s used on the production shop or factory floor. Inventory management software tracks, manages, and organizes inventory levels, orders, sales, and deliveries. The purpose of inventory management software is to maintain an optimal inventory level, track goods during transport between locations, receive new items, manage warehouse processes such as picking, packing, and shipping, prevent product obsolescence and spoilage, and ensure your products are never out of stock. Software for inventory management automates what used to be a time-consuming, manual process of counting each item one by one and recording it on paper. Digitizing this process not only makes it more accurate, it saves valuable time. Core capabilities include inventory optimization, product identification and tracking, service management for service-oriented companies, asset tracking, and reorder points.\n\nBecause inventories are often a sizable investment, they require careful management. But what is inventory control? It includes the efficient management of purchasing, receiving, warehousing, tracking, shipping and reordering — and it’s how you maximize the return on your inventory. Why Is Inventory Control Important? Inventory can be the largest portion of your company’s assets and can affect your company’s cash flow. Inventory management that increases turnover and lowers investment can improve your cash flow. For example, if you reduced your $500,000 inventory to $450,000, that $50,000 difference could end up in your bank account. According to Investopedia, inventory carrying cost — that is, the expenses related to keeping and storing unsold goods, such as financing, insurance, taxes, transportation and shrinkage loss — is usually between 20% and 30% of an inventory’s value. So that $500,000 inventory could cost you $150,000 every year. Part of good inventory management is being sure you have enough stock to meet customer demand. Few things irritate a customer more than finding out that an item is out of stock after they’ve placed an order. Managing Inventory Control\nHere are seven tips for better inventory management. - Use ABC analysis. Classify the items in your inventory into three groups: A, B and C. Pay the strictest attention to A items, which are likely your most profitable high-ticket sellers. B items are moderately priced. C items are low-priced items with the highest turnover. - Follow the 80\/20 rule. The top 20% of your items will likely account for 80% of your profits. These will probably be your A items. Make sure they get the most attention. - Identify low-turnover items. If you haven’t sold a particular item in 12 months, it probably doesn’t belong in your inventory. - Set reorder points. When your stock of an item dips below a certain quantity, you’ll need to order more. Be sure to account for the lead time to replenish your stock. - Track stock levels. Pay attention to your stock levels as you approach reorder points. - Audit frequently. The more you audit and reconcile your inventory, the better you’ll be at managing it. - Use cloud-based software. Invest in inventory management software to make tracking and reordering easier. What is inventory control worth to your business? It could be a lot. Your inventory is a large investment, so treat it with the utmost care. A well-balanced inventory can ensure that you maintain a healthy cash flow without carrying extra costs.\n\nQuestion:What's the best way to manage inventory for a service business?",

            "passage": "Inventory is usually the biggest cash investment a business makes every year and if you do not have an inventory policy, then that cash investment has no approval process. If you are overstocked, have high levels of slow moving stock or obsolete stock, then you have invested cash without approval and you do not have an effective inventory policy. You wouldn’t let any other significant expenditure be made without a detailed approval process, so why inventory? Here are a few points on how to manage your inventory effectively. Make to Order (MTO) vs. Make to Stock (MTS)\nIf you are a manufacturing business then you should be carefully analysing the MTO and MTS. You should assess the frequency, value and volume of each product and then overlay this information with the commercial strategy. If a product is sold infrequently, generates low returns, and does not form part of a wider commercial offering, then it should not be MTS. In fact, it should probably be delisted altogether. It doesn’t make sense to invest your cash in all products equally. Isn’t it better to have more stock, and consequently a better service level, for those products that generate the most sales and the most revenue? This is the purpose of an ABC classification. An ABC classification, sometimes called ‘runners, repeaters, strangers’, is an opportunity to focus cash, and improved service levels, at the products that are critically important to your business. Broadly speaking your inventory targets should be comprised of two components, cycle stock and safety stock. Cycle stock is straightforward – it is the mean expected demand during the replenishment lead time. Safety stock is more complex, and often overlooked. Safety stock is a probability assessment of demand exceeding the mean during the replenishment lead time, combined with the probability of delays in the replenishment lead time. This should be properly calculated – rules of thumb do not work and will leave you with too little or too much stock. Devising an inventory policy is not a one-off exercise. As your business profile changes, new products will come in, old products will go out and sales will increase and decrease. These factors will impact your inventory targets and consequently you should be making revisions to your MTO\/MTS, portfolio classification and inventory targets periodically. If you do not have inventory management software then simple models can be developed in MS Excel to achieve this. Developing an inventory policy is not just about the known numbers; it is not purely an analytical exercise. You need to ensure that the analysis is overlaid with the expectations of the product life cycle, market promotions, sales strategies and commercial forecasts. It is important that there is cross-functional consensus from the commercial, finance and operations teams on the levels of inventory being targeted. Once you have an inventory policy established and a process for periodic review, then you should be looking at levers on how you can work to reduce stock. There are a number of methods you can use, but typically businesses should focus on:\n- Modifying service levels (reducing service against ‘B’ & ‘C’ class items);\n- Increasing MTO;\n- Introducing minimum order quantities (MOQs) for customers;\n- Negotiating higher frequency, lower volume deliveries with suppliers;\n- Rationalising the portfolio;\n- Improving forecasting and considering implementing Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP).",

            "passage": "Plus, as with any task where humans are involved, the risk of human error is potentially high, particularly if employees feel rushed to complete the process as quickly as possible to keep labor costs down. It’s also difficult to locate the source of any mismatched numbers in a periodic system because so much time passes between counts that it’s hard to know when and where the numbers became off. Smaller organizations tend to benefit more from periodic systems because the cost involved are more manageable with less inventory and fewer labor hours to consider. Perpetual inventory control systems take a different approach. Instead of only tracking inventory at periodic intervals, you track each item throughout its journey across your facility. From the moment you receive it, to the moment it is used in your operations, sold, or scrapped, it’s tracked. You get up-to-the-minute data on precisely where your items are and what they’re being used for. This data is gathered from sensors, barcodes, and scanners that keep tabs on items in real time, helping to eliminate errors from miscounts and helping your team pull inventory items more efficiently. The moment out-of-stock items are received and allocated to the proper bin, your team can be notified and begin using them immediately, instead of sitting on the shelf waiting for the next cycle count. The challenges of perpetual systems are different that those for periodic systems. Instead of needing large amounts of labor to perform counts, you need to invest money upfront in the sensors, barcodes, scanners, software, and other technology that helps you collect your data. And the more locations you have, the more equipment you need to buy. You’ll still need to perform cycle counts periodically to reconcile any incorrect numbers, but it’s far less often than with a periodic system. Ultimately, periodic inventory control systems are typically best suited for smaller organizations with few inventory items to manage and track. For larger companies with hundreds of items to keep track of, a perpetual control system is the more cost-effective option. How do I cost-effectively manage inventory? Alright so, you need to control you inventory to keep your costs down, but what’s the best way to do that? There are essentially three ways to manage inventory, regardless of what control system you use:\n- Paper checklists\n- Inventory management software\nEach system can be useful, but only one will help you keep costs down and improve your ROI. Let’s find out which one. Pen and paper checklists\nBelieve it or not, there are still many companies that attempt to manage their entire inventory with a pen and paper. This can work, if you are a very small business with just a few items that aren’t very critical to your operations. Doing everything by hand significantly increases the potential for human error and it requires a lot of time spent away from more productive tasks. The next step up from a pad of paper is spreadsheets. You can store an enormous amount of data in them, and your team can update them instantly as needed. The problem with spreadsheets is that when someone updates them, suddenly that specific version of the file is now the most up to date so if unless the next updates the exact same file, you no longer have a unified source of data. Spreadsheets still require manual updates and modifications so you’re still spending money for someone to keep that spreadsheet updated. While they can get the job done in some cases, spreadsheets are still not the most cost-effective way to manage complex inventories. Inventory management software\nData and automation are the tools of industry and are proven to help control costs and improve ROI. Apply these powerful tools to your inventory with inventory management software to get more from your inventory. With this software, you can implement a robust perpetual control system and track every item across your entire operation, even across multiple facilities. The best part about this is that you can instantly see where you inventory costs are going. Instead of waiting to reconcile your inventory accounting a few times a year, you can quickly tell which parts are not being used efficiently and which parts you aren’t using as much. In fact, most organizations don’t use as much as 90% of their MRO inventory every year and your software solution can show you what parts aren’t being utilized efficiently. Remember that money we were leaving on the table with inefficient purchasing and ordering methods for restocking inventory? Inventory management software helps ensure you don’t miss a single dollar.",

            "passage": "Are your trade contacting clients taking advantage of technology solutions? In today’s digital world, there is no excuse not to use technology to help manage a business. Discover the ways you can encourage your field service clients to increase their profitability and improve their business operations. As an accountant working with field service businesses, how do you help your clients manage, or increase, their profitability? If you want to add value to your field service partnerships, providing tools for your clients to run operations more efficiently, avoid losing profits and make smart decisions is something you might want to add to the top of your list. Here are three ways you can help your field service clients increase their profitability. Tip 1: Use workflow automation to streamline operations\nAlthough technology is widely used by businesses large and small, many businesses in the field service industry continue to run operations on paper. Field service management software, job management software, and other cloud-based software platforms provide workflow automation - the automatic execution of manual processes based on workflow rules. When businesses automate their processes, they can increase efficiency by working smarter rather than harder. How does workflow automation increase efficiency? Let’s say field staff are manually recording job details on paper and then bringing those slips of paper into a physical office. In this scenario, important information could go missing, office staff might spend unnecessary time deciphering messy handwriting, and data is recorded twice (once by their field staff and then again by the person handling billing and invoicing). Software with workflow automation capabilities as well as desktop and mobile features will help decrease the amount of errors created in transferring job details, remove the time spent on double data entry, and minimize the chance the information goes missing as it would now be automatically entered into your system. Overall, workflow automation helps businesses save time thus increasing billable hours, and increased billable hours leads to increased profits. Tip 2: Manage inventory from the cloud to avoid losing profits\nHow do your field service clients manage their inventory? Without a central location to track inventory and keep up with material costs, it is easy for field service businesses to lose track of what is in their warehouse or in the vans of their field staff. Encourage your clients to use inventory tracking software to gain full visibility of the materials on hand. This directly ties back into increasing profits as a clear picture into inventory levels will help these businesses make better purchasing decisions, avoid overstock and deter field staff from buying materials at a higher price on site. Some inventory management systems even allow users to import supplier catalogs and compare them side by side to determine the best pricing. Without cloud-based inventory management, field service businesses could be manually combing through supplier catalogs to find pricing, spend hours manually counting materials in their warehouse, or constantly need to follow up with field staff to determine what materials are on their vans. When all inventory-related information is housed in the cloud, determining inventory levels is quick and easy. Tip 3: Generate reports to make more profitable decisions\nWhen your field service clients have more information, you are able to help them make better-informed decisions. Generating reports through a field service management system is an easy way to gather data in one place and make sense of the data at hand. Encourage your clients to regularly use reporting in order to collect data from the day-to-day to discover trends within their business. For example, if a field service business wants to discover which jobs are most profitable versus those that are least profitable, a contract profitability report would be extremely helpful. This type of report would show the amount spent on resources and materials, the amount of time it took to complete a job or project, the total amount invoiced and other important details. Field service clients would be able to view the gross and net profits and compare across jobs to see which jobs are causing them to lose money and which ones bring in more money at less cost. Reporting on this type of information helps you assist your field service clients in making more profitable decisions. When your reporting is tied to a larger field service management solution, field service clients can automatically create reports based on data in their system and even set automation rules to receive scheduled reports at specified times. Workflow automation, cloud-based inventory management and reporting are three simple ways for field service businesses to successfully increase the profitability.

            "passage": "5 Inventory Planning Best Practices\nIn a session we co-presented at the recent National Conference on Operations & Fulfillment in Las Vegas, we led a panel that delivered the following top five inventory planning best practices:\n- Build partnerships with suppliers. View your suppliers as subordinates and they’ll simply do your bidding. Work with them as partners and you’ll succeed together. You'll achieve more sales — with higher fulfillment, fewer overstocks and better inventory turnover — if you have a partner relationship with suppliers. Communicate with suppliers comprehensively and often. If they can anticipate your needs, they have a better chance of having raw materials and manufacturing capacity available when you need it. Establish these relationships so suppliers can tell you any bad news before delays in production or delivery impact your business. - Capture shadow or lost demand. Incomplete or inaccurate demand data leads to faulty demand planning and inaccurate purchasing decisions. What's more, it negatively impacts staff efficiency. Without accurate demand data, merchants can make incorrect decisions about strong vs. weak sellers. In addition, not capturing lost demand understates response rates and average order size, potentially impacting future list selection. - Measure both order and item fulfillment. Order fulfillment is the best measure of customer satisfaction. It gauges the percentage of customers that are shipped their orders complete at the time of order. The best measure of inventory buying performance is item fulfillment. This measures the percentage of individual items that are shipped to customers when ordered. Understand the relationship between the two so individual inventory buyers can comprehend their impact on total customer experience. - Forecast Internet demand. With Web sales growing to more than 50 percent of total sales for many catalogers, there's growing concern about how best to forecast. First, understand the true source of the demand. On average, only 10 percent to 20 percent of Internet demand is truly “incremental” and not driven by other media. There are two main approaches to online forecasting: time-phased modeling and traditional offer-based forecasting with demand curves. Both are valid. Ensure that you understand the marketing dynamics of your business to apply the appropriate mix of the two forecasting models. For details, see Ray Goodman’s March 2009 Catalog Success article, “Grab the Bull by Both Horns.”\n- Build processes for speed. Every day yields new information to consider. Success is directly related to the speed of receiving, processing and acting on new information. Whether it’s reforecasting demand, placing new purchase orders or adjusting existing ones, build systems and processes that maximize speed.

The key to an efficient and profitable business is total visibility into the inventory process from start to finish and management tools to help you maintain optimal stock levels year-round. An effective inventory management system helps you streamline all the moving parts of your warehouse: From recommending optimal stock levels all the way to keeping your supply chain organized and running smoothly. Learn the basics of inventory management and discover how an inventory management system can help you increase profitability and reduce waste. Inventory is usually one of the largest assets a company owns, which is why inventory mismanagement is one of the top reasons small businesses fail. Inefficient asset inventory management can decrease your profitability in several ways:\nHaving more stock on hand than you actually need can cost you. You have to pay for more warehouse space, which is expensive, and perishable items can spoil before you’re able to sell them. Staying ahead of the curve on retail trends helps you capitalize on the popular items customers want at the moment. If you’re slow to adapt to the changing market, however, customers will look elsewhere and you’ll surrender market share. Customers will order from somewhere else if you don’t have what they want in stock. At the very least, stockouts will cost you sales. If they happen often, you’ll lose customers. Investing in an inventory management system can yield excellent ROI. Not only does an inventory management system make it easier to get your products to the customers who want them, it can provide valuable insights so that you’re ordering the right inventory at the right time and in the right quantities. Here are some examples of how investing in inventory management pays off:\nOrder inventory in the right quantities at the right time so that you’re never over- or under-stocked. More productivity and less time wasted looking for missing items or tracking things by hand. Well-managed stock leads to more efficient and organized warehouses. Orders ship faster and are more accurate, leading to satisfied customers and upheld service level agreements. Inventory is considered a business asset, so inventory management ties in closely with accounting. When inventory and accounting are integrated well, you get real-time metrics into your goods at every step of the process. Your inventory management system should support multiple inventory valuation methods and functions such as:\nThe cost of goods sold divided by average inventory on hand. Low turnover rate indicates duplicate orders and deteriorating inventory value. High turnover rate can mean excess shipping costs to quickly replace things that are out of stock, incomplete orders, and wasted time trying to locate missing items. Balanced turnover rate indicates high efficiency, lower costs, and higher customer satisfaction. The cost of available goods for sale divided by the number of units for sale. This metric yields the weighted average cost per unit. Estimate of the expected cost for an item in the accounting records, which is periodically checked against the actual cost. The variance between the two numbers is recorded in the accounting records. This method is used when it’s too time-consuming to track actual costs in real time. Refers to the list of sub-items that make up a single inventory item. Bundling the parts and items that make up a single finished item. A logistics term that refers to receiving inventory just before or at the exact time it’s needed. Tracks inventory from manufacturing to when it’s used on the production shop or factory floor. Inventory management software tracks, manages, and organizes inventory levels, orders, sales, and deliveries.

For example, if you reduced your $500,000 inventory to $450,000, that $50,000 difference could end up in your bank account. According to Investopedia, inventory carrying cost — that is, the expenses related to keeping and storing unsold goods, such as financing, insurance, taxes, transportation and shrinkage loss — is usually between 20% and 30% of an inventory’s value. So that $500,000 inventory could cost you $150,000 every year. Part of good inventory management is being sure you have enough stock to meet customer demand. Few things irritate a customer more than finding out that an item is out of stock after they’ve placed an order. Managing Inventory Control\nHere are seven tips for better inventory management. - Use ABC analysis. Classify the items in your inventory into three groups: A, B and C. Pay the strictest attention to A items, which are likely your most profitable high-ticket sellers. B items are moderately priced. C items are low-priced items with the highest turnover. - Follow the 80\/20 rule. The top 20% of your items will likely account for 80% of your profits. These will probably be your A items. Make sure they get the most attention. - Identify low-turnover items. If you haven’t sold a particular item in 12 months, it probably doesn’t belong in your inventory. - Set reorder points. When your stock of an item dips below a certain quantity, you’ll need to order more. Be sure to account for the lead time to replenish your stock. - Track stock levels. Pay attention to your stock levels as you approach reorder points. - Audit frequently. The more you audit and reconcile your inventory, the better you’ll be at managing it. - Use cloud-based software. Invest in inventory management software to make tracking and reordering easier. What is inventory control worth to your business? It could be a lot. Your inventory is a large investment, so treat it with the utmost care. A well-balanced inventory can ensure that you maintain a healthy cash flow without carrying extra costs.",
